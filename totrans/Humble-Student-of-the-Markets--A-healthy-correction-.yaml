    of the defensively oriented Utilities sector (in purple). Note how cyclical stocks

    sector has rolled over significantly in the last few weeks.

    in risk appetite. The silver/gold ratio has started to turn up. Silver is often
    considered to be the poor man's gold and has tended to be more volatile and has
    acted as a good indicator of risk appetite.

    over a year. The bottom panel shows that the last time this breakout happened,
    which was in September 2011, gold rallied from roughly the 1280 level and ultimately
    topped out at over 1800, though the silver-gold ratio flashed a sell signal at
    about 1570.

    weak. The pace of job growth had fallen dramatically from the start of the year,
    retail sales were flattening out, and GDP growth had slowed to 1.5%. This data
    combined with the downside risks from Europe raised genuine concerns that more
    easing was necessary. But they held back, instead waiting to see how the data
    evolved.

    medium-term forecast. The July employment report was stronger, retail sales picked
    up, and overall growth is looking stronger, with Goldman Sachs' GDP tracking estimate
    rising to 2.3% for the third quarter. In addition, equity markets are on firmer
    ground as the crisis in Europe has at least temporarily receded. While certainly
    not exciting, the better tone of the data is palpable. I think the better data
    influenced Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart to shift his language
    away from his dovish July comments. In short, I would argue that the data since
    the last FOMC meeting has in fact pointed toward an improvement in the pace of
    the recovery, which I think will pull the middle ground back from the brink of
    additional asset purchases.

    direction of Bullard, which is why I see QE3 as less of a slam-dunk than the minutes
    seemed to imply. Evans pushed his usual agenda; I would expect nothing less from
    him. He wanted more action before this summer's signs of slowing. No reason to
    expect the most recent data would change his view.
