    upside breakouts everywhere. Consider, for example, this relative performance
    chart of SPY against IEF, which is the ETF for 10-year Treasuries. The ratio staged
    an upside breakout on the weekly chart, with relative resistance a some distance
    away indicating considerable upside potential for stocks.

    the new Sloven23s traded up by more than 4 points, which means yield fell by more
    than 50bp from the 6% the government paid. A fairy tale ending.
