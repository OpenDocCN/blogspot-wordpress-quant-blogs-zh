## Do you pass the “Joel Test” for Data Science?

Interested to know how many teams [score](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/joel-test-data-science/) well on the “Joel test”for Data Science.

Number one killer questions for any project, is “Can new hires get set up in the environment to run analyses on their first day?”.  Most projects I’ve seen fail on this.  Docker maybe your friend here 🙂

“Can predictive models be deployed to production without custom engineering or infrastructure work?” is a little ambiguous, but hits the nail on the head with regards to “Done” and getting into production to achieve an Return on Investment (ROI)
