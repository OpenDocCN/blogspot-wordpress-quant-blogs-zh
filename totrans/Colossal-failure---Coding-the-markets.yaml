    ‘[A Colossal Failure](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Colossal-Failure-Common-Sense-Incredible/dp/0091936152)‘
    book on the collapse of LEH. I greatly enjoyed it’s mixture of first hand experience
    of trading at Lehman’s with airport thriller style page turning narrative drive.
    The Jeffery Archerish rattling good yarn story momentum comes from Patrick Robinson’s
    ghost writing – Robinson is a thriller writer. The Lehman experience from McDonald
    is not just entertaining description of senior LEH people and their machinations,
    but also lots of good detail on the trades he put on.

    tone of the writing. It is a different approach to business writing, which is
    often too sober, boring even. There aren’t may comparable books, but I would mention
    Ferguson’s High Stakes, and Lewis’s Liar’s Poker. I wonder if McDonald has another
    book in him ?  He could be the next Michael Lewis. Or maybe he’ll be too busy
    advising for a film project, because Colossal Failure would make a geat Hollywood
    movie in the vein of Trading Places or Gordon Gekko.
