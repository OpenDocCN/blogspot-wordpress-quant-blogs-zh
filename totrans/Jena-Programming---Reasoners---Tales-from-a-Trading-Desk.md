# Jena Programming – Reasoners | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Jena Programming – Reasoners

The [Jena](http://www.slideshare.net/onlyjiny/jena-programming) Framework Architecture as shown visually [here](https://jena.apache.org/getting_started/index.html) provides a good high level view of how the Inference API allows [reasoners](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/index.html) to be leverage of your solution.

“[Querying/Reasoning](http://opentox.org/data/documents/development/RDF%20files/JavaOnly/query-reasoning-with-jena-and-sparql) with Jena and SPARQL” provides a number of use cases with sample code which is helpful.  There’s also a nice HelloSemanticWeb sample [here](https://github.com/agastheswar/Semantic-Web-application/blob/master/HelloSemanticWeb/src/org/semweb/assign6/HelloSemanticWeb.java).
