- en: Several bloggers have posted on Hyman Minsky, who is somewhat of a celebrity
    now that a crisis happened, and he wrote about financial crises. I was a teaching
    assistant for Minsky in college, back in 1986 at Washington University in St.Louis.
    I probably would not have gotten an econ PhD without his motivation, I really
    admired his intellectual enthusiasm, that he was attacking problems of importance
    and getting a lot of meaning out of it. The essence of his theory is that markets
    are endogenously unstable, and so, left to their own devices they repeatedly crash
    and burn. That, I think is true. But his mechanism was rather vague. He posited
    you have normal (hedge) finance, where investment is inspired by cashflow returns,
    which pays back both principle and interest. In hedge speculative finance, returns
    merely cover the interest. Finally, returns do not cover interest or principle,
    and you are hoping for your collateral to rise in value, which can happen in a
    bubble.

  zh: 几位博主曾发表过关于海曼·明斯基的文章，他因金融危机而名声大噪，他曾写过关于金融危机的文章。我曾是他在大学时的助教，那是在1986年，位于圣路易斯的华盛顿大学。也许没有他的激励，我就不会拿到经济学博士学位，我真的很钦佩他的知识热情，他攻克了一些重要的问题并从中得到了很多意义。他的理论核心是市场自身的不稳定性，如果完全交由市场自行，它们就会屡次崩溃。我认为这是正确的。但是他的机制却相当模糊。他假定你有正常（避险）融资，投资是源于现金流回报的，它支付本金和利息。在避险投机性融资中，回报只包括利息。最后，回报不足以支付利息或本金，你希望你的抵押品价值上涨，这在泡沫中可能会发生。
- en: Unfortunately, this theory is pretty useless in real time. If you look at leverage
    ratios over the business cycle, they don't vary too much, so empirically you can't
    look at leverage and see any pattern. Like now, it is all ex post, in that very
    few people were warning of a housing bubble pre-2007\. After the fact it is obvious,
    but theory should be predictive. By definition, an asset collapse will be found
    to have been dependent on expectations of rising collateral prices, because if
    cash flow could prevent the crash there would not be one. On the other hand, some
    lenders knew their underwriting standards were predicated on collateral at least
    not falling in value, and this should have been a warning.

  zh: 很不幸，这个理论在实际中几乎没什么用。如果你观察经济周期中的杠杆比率，它们变化不大，所以从实证上来看，你无法观察到杠杆并发现任何规律。就像现在，所有的事都是事后的，在2007年之前很少有人警告说存在房地产泡沫。事后一切显而易见，但理论应该有预测性。根据定义，资产崩盘的发生将被发现依赖于对抵押品价格上涨的预期，因为如果现金流可以防止崩盘，那就不会发生崩盘。另一方面，一些放贷人知道他们的贷款标准是建立在抵押品至少不会贬值的基础上的，这本该是一个警告。
- en: His post-Keynesian focus on the distinction between risk and uncertainty does
    not generate much insight, though I spent a lot of time on this because it is
    so very seductive. Though many have been intrigued by the Keynesian/Knightian
    uncertainty approach, in general uncertainty is positive correlated with volatility,
    and it does not generate a consistent return premium as one would expect. Analyst
    disagreement, trading volume, are correlated with volatility, and generally negatively
    related to cross sectional returns. IPOs have a lot of uncertainty--they have
    no track record--but they have lower than average returns. So I don't think this
    distinction buys one much, as risk and uncertainty are highly correlated, and
    so we have the same puzzles.

    ideologues, that microeconomics was all apologetics (hated the 1st and 2nd welfare
    theorems), and that national income accounting implied deficits put a floor on
    profits (profits=investment+budget deficit). I remember once Rik Hafer was presenting
    some results on how rational expectations proved the Quantity Theory, noting that
    when money supply numbers were released, interest rates moved in the right way
    within minutes (in the eighties, money supply numbers moved markets--good times,
    good times). Minsky was reading the paper and said "you are doing all this over
    a 5 basis point move in interest rates! This is irrelevant!" And stormed out.
    Everyone kind of looked at each other like "there he goes again".

  zh: 他对经济学有很多古怪的自由主义观念。他认为货币主义者是意识形态家，微观经济学都是辩护（讨厌第一和第二福利定理），国民收入核算意味着赤字对利润构成了底线（利润=投资+预算赤字）。我记得有一次里克·哈弗（Rik
    Hafer）正在介绍一些关于理性预期如何证明数量论的结果，注意到货币供应数据发布后，利率在几分钟内以正确的方式变动（在80年代，货币供应数据影响市场——那是美好的时光，美好的时光）。明斯基正在读报纸，然后说：“你们都在对5个基点的利率变动做这一切！这是不相关的！”然后愤然离去。大家都有点像
    “他又走了” 一样看着彼此。

    get all excited. This is it! He was always waiting for the market to crash any
    second. After I got out of school, my first job was as an economics analyst for
    First Interstate Bancorp, and the fed was defending the dollar then, which in
    Minsky theory kills the Ponzi bubble. I had about $5000, and opened up an account
    at Charles Schwab. Based on my re-readings of Minsky, which made me always ready
    for a crash, I bought an S&P100 put on October 16, 1987 for $7, and sold it late

    the greatest one-day decline in market history. As the Fed eased, I then reversed
    the position, going long options in 1988\. After taxes and naive execution of
    single stock options (option market makers were crooks back then), I got creamed,
    and even though I was long calls through 1988 when the market was up 22%, I basically
    was back to where I started (though with a really cool stereo) by the end of 1988\.
    My arithmetic return was still astronomical, however.
