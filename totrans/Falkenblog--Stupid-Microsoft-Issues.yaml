    have to add 'modified date'. Modified date, and name, are my most obvious search

    to instantly in Excel2003\. Why is this better?

    caused by an errant keystroke, as if it is so proud of its logic. It did this
    in 2003 too, but you would think someone would tell them that they are not going
    to get the Fields Medal for telling me that a cell with sum(A1:A15) that includes
    A15 is circular with neat arrows. It was a mistake--just say #N/A and let me fix
    it!'

- en: 4) The search in Vista is 100% more efficient than the old search in XP--if
    you know the when and where of the file you are searching for. The new 'expanded'
    search pane does not allow searches between two dates, or between two sizes, in
    the search pane. But, you have to 'index' all the areas you want searched, which
    is not obvious as I recently downloaded a file that went to C:\users\ericf\AppData\Local\bla
    bla, which was not indexed, so I could not find it even though I just downloaded
    it. If you do index your entire hard drive, your system is weighed down by indexing
    everything. Basically, the search is much more efficient if you know exactly what
    you want in the exact space you want. Indeed, you can click on a file in the folders
    view, and it gives you the option to index the file for searches. If I took the
    time to check on its properties, what are the odds I won't know where it is? This
    was designed by an idiot.

- en: 5) To get to 'Task Manager' you need to navigate an extra menu. To create a
    new Word or Excel document you need to navigate an extra menu. In Word, the option
    is blog post, in Excel, the option is their collection of stupid templates. More
    is not merely different in Vista/Office07, it is worse.

- en: 6) There's more functionality and more buttons for everything in Office 2007--but
    good luck finding it. If you are upgrading from 2003, spend an hour to create
    your own custom toolbar, because if you have been using Word or Excel since 1987
    like me, their reorganization is like moving from English to Dutch--Dutch may
    be a more efficient language, but I really don't feel like learning it at this
    point. It may test well with newbie teenagers or grandmothers, but it sucks for
    an experienced 43 year old user. Best to avoid by bring your most favorite 40
    tools onto the toolbar, then using Google for help in figuring out how to do what
    you can't find (Google Search is better for help that the application-specific
    built in help).

    old one is a breeze, the new one much more complicated. Try re-ordering legend
    list. Try formating an axis label. It is ''rich'', in the way that C++ is rich:
    it contains the solution to everything, you merely have to work it out from some
    obscure first principles.'
