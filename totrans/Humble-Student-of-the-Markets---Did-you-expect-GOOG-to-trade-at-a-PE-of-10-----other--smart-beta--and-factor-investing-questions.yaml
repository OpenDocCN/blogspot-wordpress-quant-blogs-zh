- en: If "smart beta" is really another way of packaging active, or semi-active, factor
    investing, then you have to understand the pitfalls of the factor investing approach.
    The one valuable lesson I learned as a quantitative investor is that not all factors
    do not necessarily work well across sectors and industries.
  prefs: []

- en: BARRA taught us that one of the ways of determining the sources of equity risk
    is industry exposure. If a portfolio tilts away from the market index (however
    you want to define it) with different industry exposures, then that portfolio
    has an active bet, or exposure. The above examples of value ETFs, they have differing
    industry bets that form part of their active exposure. If it is marketed as a
    passive or semi-passive portfolio, then the investor has to make a decision of
    whether those more or less permanent industry bets make sense as a way of creating
    alpha.

    but have not subjected their ideas to practical sanity checks. For instance, some
    studies have shown that portfolio of stocks weighted by sales, rather than capitalization,
    have yielded better risk-adjusted returns. If you were to naively weight a portfolio
    of stocks by their sales, then you would tilt the portfolio towards companies
    with high sales and low margins. Do you want to necessarily bet that low-margin
    businesses, such as grocery chain stores, will outperform in the long-run?

    the industry bets by setting the same industry exposure in the portfolio as the
    market portfolio, factors do not necessarily behave the same way across all industries.
    Let us suppose that you were to screen for low-PE stocks and overweight them in
    your portfolio. Low PE is a value factor and it does not necessarily work well
    in growth industries. For example, did you really think that a growth-oriented
    technology stock like Google would trade at 10 or 12 times earnings? If it were
    to trade at those kinds of multiples, would you really want to own it? A so-called
    growth stock sporting a low PE is really a busted growth company with a turnaround
    story (whatever happened to PALM?) which encompass a very different style of investing
    than the usual growth and momentum theme. For instance, see what

    indirectly through "smart beta" concepts or directly in an active or semi-active
    fashion, you are making a deliberate bet against the market portfolio. Just make
    sure that your approach to factor investing is done in an intelligent way and
    it has not taken on any bets that don't pass human sanity checks. In other words,
    use both your left (analytical and reasoning) brain as well as your right (creative
    and intuitive) brain to approach factor investing in an intelligent way.
