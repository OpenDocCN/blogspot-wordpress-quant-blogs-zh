# VIX and More: Options Available for New S&P 500 Triple ETFs

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/options-available-for-new-s-500-triple.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/options-available-for-new-s-500-triple.html#0001-01-01)

Though they are less than two weeks old, the two new [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs) based on the S&P 500 index already have options available to trade. The bullish 3x ETF, Ultra ProShares ([UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)) has July options that expire one week from Friday with strikes from 60 to 95, including single dollar increments from 80 through 90\. The bearish -3x Short ProShares ([SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU)) has options available from 70 to 95, with all the strikes in single dollar increments.

In anticipation of a broad range of applications and the potential for some significant movement, the strikes for the December options range all the way from 30 to 140 for UPRO and from 40 to 150 for SPXU.

While both of these triple ETFs have been attracting more volume each day, neither has managed to break the million share mark yet. I anticipate that we will begin to see million share days in each of these ETFs next week and shortly thereafter, UPRO and SPXU will begin to trade in the volumes currently associated with leveraged ETF pairs such as [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS)/[FAZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAZ) and [SSO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SSO)/[SDS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SDS).

As these triple ETFs are based on the same underlying as the VIX, an entire new genus of trading strategies is being hatched as I write this…
