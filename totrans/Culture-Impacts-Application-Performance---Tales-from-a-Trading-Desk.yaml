    from Joe Duffy, this time on Performance Culture. Joe sums the whole performance
    culture issue up quite well in the early part of his essay:'

- en: The cultural transformation must start from the top ‚Äì management taking an active
    role in performance, asking questions, seeking insights, demanding rigor ‚Äì while
    it simultaneously comes from the bottom ‚Äì engineers actively seeking to understand
    performance of the code they are writing, ruthlessly taking a zero-tolerance stance
    on regressions, and being ever-self-critical and on the lookout for proactive
    improvements.

- en: For me, the major issue that performance issues stem from in engineering is
    management. The drive on features, ignoring performance, and likewise not understanding
    the engineering demands required from engineering to achieve performance, come
    back to Joe‚Äôs classic comment, ‚ÄúManagement must care ‚Äú. In many cases, I truly
    don‚Äôt think management care, or care to understand.

    member. This is the same outside of performance in the general quality space,
    and the ‚Äútester‚Äù silo mentality üò¶

    assuming that someone else would catch any problems that arise.

    down at times, to spend energy on things other than cranking out features

- en: In my view, management in a lot of companies needs to wake up from the sleepy
    drug of features, features,features. Without a stable engineering backed culture
    within a team, driven by a sensible blend of features and engineering, products
    are doomed to fail, causing considerabel financial loss
