  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While GDX may be a little extended in the short run, I would like to point out
    the long-term potential in gold. Gold has staged a convincing upside breakout
    from a multi-month cup and handle formation. Moreover, the gold-to-S&P 500 ratio
    (bottom panel) is turning up from a multi-year saucer-shaped bottom, indicating
    the possible start of a new relative bull for gold over stocks. As well, the breakout
    has occurred with little fanfare as investors have been focused on AI and GLP-1
    plays. This combination of breakout and lack of public participation suggests
    a substantial upside potential.
