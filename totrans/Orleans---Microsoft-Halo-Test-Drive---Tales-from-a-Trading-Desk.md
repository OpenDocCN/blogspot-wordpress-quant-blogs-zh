## Orleans – Microsoft Halo Test Drive

[ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-orleans-cloud-programming-model-gets-a-halo-test-drive-7000009300/) has a curious article on Microsoft Orleans, offering an interesting quote from [Microsoft](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/orleans-microsofts-next-generation-programming-model-for-the-cloud/7152) [Research](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/141999/pldi%2011%20submission%20public.pdf) accomplishments:

> *“The cloud-systems team celebrated a year of successful deployment of its distributed cloud technology—Orleans—in production for Microsoft’s Halo team, and the team has scaled its system very significantly since then.”*

Does anyone know if Orleans is the next step on from [Axum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum_%28programming_language%29)/[TPL Dataflows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/gg585582.aspx)?

Its nice to see Microsoft offering at least something in the [Akka](http://akka.io/) space.

> An [actor](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs239/papers/karmani-agha.pdf)-like model with declarative [specification](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/) of persistence, replication, and consistency and using lightweight transactions to support the development of reliable and scalable client + cloud software

Now all we have to do is wait (and hope) that Orleans is released on Azure
