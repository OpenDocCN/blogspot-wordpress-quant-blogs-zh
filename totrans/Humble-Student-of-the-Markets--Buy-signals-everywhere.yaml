- en: One of the most reliable trading signals occur when an indicator becomes oversold
    and mean reverts to neutral (buy signal), or if it gets overbought and mean reverts
    to neutral (sell signal). We saw numerous versions of buy signals of that variety
    from the VIX Index this week.

    When this ratio rises above 1, that is an inverted term structure indicating market
    fear. As the chart below shows, the VIX/VXV ratio inverted last week and returned
    to a normal upward sloping curve on Monday.

    Historically, such episodes have resolved themselves bullishly.
