- en: Now, after touting CAB for a few months, Microsoft has announced Acropolis.

- en: A few months ago, the Microsoft DPE team came to me and tried to dissuade us
    from developing our .NET client framework in favor of using CAB. However, during
    those conversations, the word Acropolis came up a few times.

- en: Now that Microsoft is touting Acropolis, what has become of CAB? Will this now
    be an officially supported framework (remember ObjectSpaces?). What about all
    of the financial service developers that committed to CAB? And, now you have some
    Microsoft people telling us that CAB was never officially supported by Microsoft,
    that it was developed by a small group of independent developers in some far off
    country that nobody ever heard of!

- en: One thing about developing your own framework and making it a standard in the
    company is that it won't turn into a flavor-of-the-month entry. Goldman lead the
    way with OCEAN. Wachovia has OneSource, and Morgan Stanley has FidSharp and Concord.
    And we have ours. And, our companies tell our developers that they should use
    it.

- en: No doubt that Acropolis will be "better" than CAB, and will have learned lessons
    and anti-patterns from CAB usage. Only, what will Microsoft come out with in another
    6 months?
