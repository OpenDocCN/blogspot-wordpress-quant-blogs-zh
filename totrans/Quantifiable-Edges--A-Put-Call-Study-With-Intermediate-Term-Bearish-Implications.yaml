    is a study I’ve shown a few times in the past in the Subscriber Letter that appeared
    in last night’s Quantifinder for gold subscribers.

- en: This study gets off to a bit of a slow start, but then there appear to be solidly
    bearish implications for up to several weeks out. Even as much as 4-5 weeks out
    the % winners is exceptionally low, as are the win/loss ratio, the profit factor
    and the average trade.
