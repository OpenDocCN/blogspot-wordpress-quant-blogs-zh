- en: I’ve updated the Quantifiable Edges Big Time Swing System overview page with
    results through June 30th. There is not a trade currently open. I don’t update
    results that often since the system only trades about once per month on average.
    The 1st half of 2011 produced a tame but still positive return of 3.00% for SPY
    (including dividends, commissions of $0.01/share, and an assumed interest rate
    on cash of 0.18%).  This was achieved with 1 short trade and 5 long trades.

    did quite well. In the system manual I discuss how I tested the system for robustness
    using a list of 29 ETFs other than SPY. Statistics for each ETFs full history

- en: For those looking for a system that they can use as a base to build their own
    system from, the Big Time Swing is an attractive option. It is all open-coded
    and comes complete with a substantial amount of background historical research.
    And since it is only in the market about ¼ of the time, it can easily be combined
    with other systems to provide greater efficiency of capital. Once you’re ready
    to try and improve the system yourself you can also refer to the system manual
    or the August 2010 purchaser-only webinar – both of which discuss numerous ideas
    for customization.

    easy to follow mechanical rules that you can follow. The standard parameters have
    performed quite well. There are only about 12 trades per year averaging 7 trading
    days per trade. All entries and exits are either at the open or the close. And
    to be sure you have everything set up properly traders may follow the private-purchasers
    only blog that shows all SPY signals and possible entry/exit levels. This service
    is free for 12 months from the date of purchase.
