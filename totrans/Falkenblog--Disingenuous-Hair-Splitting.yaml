    of monetarism, which is that

    several monetarist economists eager to save the theory, by saying that ''money''
    was not M1, but rather, M2, or monetary aggregates per capita. Hair splitting
    did not save the quantity theory, rather, it was a typical tactic by true believers
    to save a bad idea (of course, at a log level the quantity theory still works

    disadvantaged, they must make changes necessary for them to improve their situation,

    culture is the key to improving black America. Glenn's big criticism of her point
    was classic hair splitting, using highfalutin diction with banal casuistry, so
    that if you actually understand what he says, he does not have a coherent point.

    because their arguments go into dead ends, forcing them into bizarre run-on sentences
