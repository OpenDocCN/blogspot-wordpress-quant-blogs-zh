- en: Thursday the market again posted a day where 90% of the volume went to the upside.
    This follows Tuesday’s 90% up day. I looked back to 1970 at other times the market
    put in 2 90% days in a 1-week period. Instances are small, so it’s dangerous to
    rely too much on the results, but you’ve typically seen very strong moves after
    these tandems of 90% Up Volume days. Below I’ve listed all the occurrences along
    with the 20-day return of the market after such occurrences. (Results based on
    $100k per trade.)
