    when you try to rewrite the past, and make it seem like you were right all along
    while changing your opinion, that's just wrong, and people should be held accountable.
    With the benefit of YouTube, Cramer has been busted here. On June 13th after a
    small rally, he promotes the financials and tech, and says stay away from oil
    (June 13, 2008), after the Dow subsequently drops 500 points, on June 20, 2008,
    he says you are an idiot for owning financials and tech, and not owning oil. The
    guy who put this together nails Cramer for inconsistency pretty well.

    ask questions on his nightly show on virtually any stock and he seems to have
    memorized the basics for about 2000 companies, which is very impressive. But intelligence
    without wisdom is ultimately like a 'good' trivia book, and I think Cramer is
    like a trivia book, interesting with no depth.
