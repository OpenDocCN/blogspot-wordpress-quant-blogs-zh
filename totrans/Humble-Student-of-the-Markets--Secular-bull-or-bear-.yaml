    discussion about the rotation in sector leadership from defensively oriented sectors
    to the deep cyclical sectors. Does the rotation mean that this market is truly
    ready to take off to further new highs? What does it all mean?

    start of a new secular bull market where stocks move to new highs or whether we
    are just seeing the top of a range-bound secular bear.

    price. The propensity of Baby Boomers, as they move into retirement, is to take
    money out of stocks. In order for equities to rise, those negative fund flows
    have to be met by the retirement savings of their children, the Echo Boomers.
    Two research groups looked into this topic (see papers

    moving into stocks start to overwhelm the Baby Boomers taking money out is somewhere

    process in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008\. A "beautiful deleveraging"
    involves just the right amount of austerity, debt restructuring and money printing.
    He went on to observe that, by contrast, Europe has gotten it all wrong and that
    region is likely to be mired in a Lost Decade.

    to cyclical sectors is another sign of a new upleg in equity prices and therefore
    the start of a new secular bull.

    every macro-economic data point I come across is saying one thing – the same thing.
    There is an extremely high correlation between all the varying data points and
    indicators. Data like the 10yr treasury yields, PMI manufacturing, durable goods
    orders, copper prices, international (ex Japan) stock markets, inflation expectation,
    margin levels etc – are all saying that the (global &) US economy is slowing,
    and that the risks of deflation/contraction/recession are growing.

    the US, which has been the beneficiary of the "beautiful deleveraging", be leading?
