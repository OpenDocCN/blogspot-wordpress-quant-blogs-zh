# SIFMA: .NET StockTrader | Tales from a Trading Desk

## SIFMA: .NET StockTrader

At the 2007 Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Technology Management Conference & Exhibit, Microsoft [released](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=17069) the [.NET StockTrader](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jun07/06-19NETStockTraderPR.mspx) application. .NET [StockTrader](http://blogs.msdn.com/roberdan/archive/2007/06/20/net-stocktrader-sample-application.aspx) is suppose to be a “blueprint for how companies can use its (Microsoft’s) technologies”. Given that Microsoft spent time and money on a financial services application to show off [ASP.NET and WCF](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/netframework/bb499684.aspx), why didn’t they go the extra mile and product a rich WPF client as well?
