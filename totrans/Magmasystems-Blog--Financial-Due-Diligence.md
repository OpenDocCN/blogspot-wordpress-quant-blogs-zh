# Magmasystems Blog: Financial Due Diligence

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/financial-due-diligence.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/financial-due-diligence.html#0001-01-01)

In my super-mega Investment Bank, we work with all kinds of vendors. In fact, in our old group, one of the things that we were charged with was investigating all kinds of esoteric technologies that could give us an edge in the trading world.

If you use a vendor for a "bet the farm"-type application, then you want to make sure that the vendor behind the product is rock solid. My boss, who is the Global Head of Equities Technology for the firm, asked me who the "800 lbs gorilla" is in the

CEP

space. He wanted to make sure that we were safe in our choice, and that no matter how good the technology is, we did not put all of our eggs into a guy working nights in his basement (although, those kinds of companies usually make the best software!).

There is really no 800-lbs gorilla is the "pure"

CEP

space. By "pure"

CEP

players, I am talking about guys like

Aleri

, Coral8,

Streambase

,

Esper

,

Apama

,

Truviso

,

Kaskad

, etc. In this space, most of these companies number their customers in the dozens rather than the thousands. These companies are all competing for that big reference customer, the one that companies can stand back and say "This investment bank doubled their trading revenues because of our product."

Compounding this fact is the whole credit crunch and

subprime

mess. The New York Times had an article yesterday that described the effects that the credit crunch is starting to have on all sorts of companies ... even

softeware

companies and web-design shops were mentioned. So, we need to make sure that the

CEP

vendor that we choose is not affected, nor will be affected by the credit crunch. Coincidentally, one ex-employee of a

CEP

vendor sent me private email that mentioned that his company was undergoing a round of layoffs.

No matter which

CEP

vendor you choose, you should always have one backup. This is standard practice when dealing with small vendors. You should have the vendor's source code in escrow. You should have your financial people do a deep dive on a vendor's financials. Is the vendor self-funded or are they

VC

funded? Does the

VC

have the appetite to wait 5 to 7 years for a good return on their investment? What is the past behavior of the

VC

firms with regards to

startups

? What happens if the chief architect of the product leaves the company? Is the product written in a mainstream language, in case you need to take possession of the source code that's in escrow?

These are all questions that you should ask before making the final selection of your vendor.
