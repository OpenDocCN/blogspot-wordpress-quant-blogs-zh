    inefficient. ... Stunningly, the ten percent of stocks with highest expected return,
    in aggregate, are low risk and highly profitable, with positive trends in profitability.
    They are cheap relative to current earnings, cash flow, sales, and dividends.
    ... Undeniably, the highest expected return stocks are, collectively, highly attractive;
    the lowest expected return stocks are very scary - results fatal to the efficient
    market hypothesis. While this evidence is consistent with risk loving in the cross-section,
    we also present strong evidence consistent with risk aversion in the market aggregate's
    longitudinal behavior. These behaviors cannot simultaneously exist in an efficient
    market.

    毫无疑问，预期回报最高的股票总体上是非常有吸引力的；预期回报最低的股票非常可怕——对有效市场假说是致命的。虽然这些证据与截面上的风险偏好是一致的，我们同时也提出了与市场整体纵向行为中的风险厌恶是一致的强有力证据。这些行为在一个有效的市场中是无法同时存在的。

    profitability, low leverage, and just about anything correlated with 'safe' or
    'not risky' tend to outperform their opposite. The standard approach is trying

- en: Yet, I find myself disagreeing with Haugen in two major areas. First, he says
    that he finds people are risk averse in general, because markets fall when volatility
    rises. This fact is true, whether one measures this using an equity implied volatility,
    or an contemporaneous measure of volatility (eg, those months with the highest
    daily vol will have the lowest returns). Yet going forward, this result does not
    hold. A higher implied volatility, or historical vol, does not augur higher returns.
    Thus, all we know is that when volatility rises, the stock market will fall. This
    is only consistent with risk aversion if such a fall presages a higher future
    return, as where the dividend forecast is the same, but the immediate price decline
    (and negative return) is just capitalizing this higher return. It does not work
    like that. You get a lower return immediately, and no higher return in the future.

  zh: 然而，我发现自己在两个主要领域与哈根意见不和。首先，他说他发现人们总体上是风险厌恶的，因为市场在波动性上升时会下跌。这个事实是真实的，无论是使用股票隐含波动率还是同时期波动性进行衡量（例如，那些有最高日波动率的月份将会有最低回报）。然而往前看，这个结果并不成立。更高的隐含波动率或历史波动性并不意味着更高的回报。因此，我们只知道当波动性上升时，股市会下跌。这只有在这种下跌预示着未来更高的回报时才与风险厌恶相吻合，就像股利预测是一样的，但即时价格下跌（和负回报）只是将更高的回报资本化。事情并不是这样的。你会立即得到更低的回报，并且未来也没有更高的回报。
- en: Think of it this way. If you were averse to volatility, you would want an asset
    that would be a relative outperformer in these periods, not a relative underperformer.
    But those stocks with the highest covariation with volatility changes are those
    same crappy stocks with the lowest overall return. In sum, contemporaneous inverse
    correlation between volatility and returns is inconsistent with risk aversion
    because forward-looking volatility and return correlations are weak if not negative
    as well.

  zh: 想想这样吧。如果你害怕波动性，你会想要一种资产，在这些时期的相对表现要好，而不是相对表现差。但随波动性变化相关性最高的那些股票，却是那些整体回报率最低的烂股。总的来说，波动性与回报之间的当期逆相关不符合风险厌恶理论，因为前瞻性的波动性和回报相关性也较弱，甚至负相关。
- en: Given he hates market efficiency, he should jump over to my side, and see it
    as an equilibrium where people pay for hope. There is generally risk neutrality,
    with a little risk loving at the high end, and premium for cash-type assets, creating
    a slight bow in risk and return.

- en: In the early 2000's, he had a model where he ran rolling regressions on 50 or
    so factors, and allowed these coefficients to flip around from positive to negative.
    Many of the 50 factors are highly correlated (profit margin, ROE, ROA), and this
    causes their coefficients to have the 'wrong sign', because correlated explanatory
    variables tend to do this. He is vague about how he computes 'profits' in his
    backtests, and this can be problematic if, say, you use 1994 profits for 1995
    returns, considering the '1994' fiscal year ends in June 1995 for many companies,
    and is released with a lag of up to 3 months. It is straightforward to account
    for this, but unless the author notes his explicit care for these issues, one
    has to assume he did not do a good job. I remember seeing his 1-10 portfolios
