# VIX and More: XLY and XHB Move Above 200 Day Moving Averages

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/xly-and-xhb-move-above-200-day-moving.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/xly-and-xhb-move-above-200-day-moving.html#0001-01-01)

Two important ETFs, [XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XHB) (consumer discretionary) and [XHB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XHB) (homebuilders) have moved above their [200 day simple moving averages](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA) today for the first time since early October.

Among other important indices and ETFs that are closing in on their 200 day SMAs are the NASDAQ-100 index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)), semiconductor index ([SOX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOX)) and emerging markets ETF ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)).

If the current bullishness holds, we may see widespread moves above the 200 day SMA – and the possibility of renewed buying interest…or an opportunity to take profits.

I am cautious as the SPX approaches 875, but am not interested in a substantial short position until there is some sort of bearish momentum.
