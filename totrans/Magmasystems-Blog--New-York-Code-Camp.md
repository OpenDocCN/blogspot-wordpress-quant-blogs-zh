# Magmasystems Blog: New York Code Camp

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-york-code-camp.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-york-code-camp.html#0001-01-01)

[DonXml](http://www.donxml.com)

is organizing a

[Code Camp](http://nyc.codecamp.us)

on Saturday, March 3, in New York City. Last year's camp sold out in 24 hours and they had to max out at 150 attendees. This year, they expanded the number to 400, so there should be plenty of room.

Don is looking for speakers, especially from the financial sector. So, all of you people from Goldman, Morgan, JPMC, Citi, DB, Barcap, Lehman, hedge funds, etc .... get ready to spill the beans! Come tell us all how you are using .NET at your jobs.

Don is also trying to organize a Java/.NET Code Camp in New Jersey, and is looking for some company to donate space. Get in touch with Don if you are a North/NorthCentral-based organization that can donate some conference facility for one Saturday.
