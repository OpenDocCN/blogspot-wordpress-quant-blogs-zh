- en: Business cycles and the essence of long-run economic growth are distinct issues.
    Preventing recessions is not the key to growth, as these are regrettable but unavoidable
    companions to an economy directed by a capital allocation process that is susceptible
    to systematic failure. Preventing the last failure is pretty irrelevant, because
    the next systematic failure will be different. Last I checked, only the US government
    is offering low-down payment loans, and no one offers no-documentation loans,
    so our government is not really helping here. As for creating growth via something
    new, if centralized governments could do that, the Soviet Union would still be
    around.

  zh: 商业周期和长期经济增长的本质是不同的问题。预防衰退并非是增长的关键，因为这些都是令人遗憾但不可避免的伴随着由容易受到系统性失败影响的资本分配过程引导的经济。预防上一次失败并不重要，因为下一次系统性失败会有所不同。据我所知，只有美国政府提供低首付贷款，也没有人提供无文件贷款，所以我们的政府在这方面并没有真正帮助。至于通过一些新的事物创造增长，如果中央集权的政府能够做到这一点，苏联还将存在至今。
- en: That decentralized, self-interested, people can collectively make such large
    errors seems irrational or corrupt to many, but they should remember that growing
    economies require people to be making things better, which means, new ways of
    doing things. New ideas are often wrong. Economics has gone onto intellectual
    cul-de-sacs many times (socialism, Keynesian macro models, input-output models,
    Hilbert spaces in finance, Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Kalman-filter macroeconomic
    models, etc.). Other scientific disciplines have their own mistakes, and political
    mistakes--stupid wars--are also common. These are rarely conspiracies, but rather,
    smart people making mistakes because the ideas that are true, important, and new,
    are really hard to discern, and tempting ones are alluring when lots of other
    seemingly successful people are doing them.

    more valuable pursuits. The computer got rid of things from typesetters, secretaries,

    they did something else, making the economic pie bigger. This is antithetical

    is a story I heard second-hand about a football player for Minnesota Vikings in
    the 1970s. Coach Bud Grant called this marginal player into a meeting, and said,
    ''Here''s what I need you to do...''. The player, an articulate fellow quite confident
    in himself, interrupted with an explanation of why he wasn''t doing better and
    suggestions about how to correct it, mainly focused what others were doing wrong.
    Grant cut him off: ''You don''t understand. This isn''t a negotiation. Do what
    I''m telling you, and you have a role here. Otherwise, you don''t.'' Hierarchies
    only work well when people have clearly defined goals, and managers who manage

- en: Private firms can do this much more quickly and often than government, and are
    rewarded with investment and retained earnings to the degree they do it well.
    When the government wants to do something, like build a light-rail system, it
    instead satisfies all its stakeholders who have no financial downside, only veto
    power, and so the cost/benefit calculus is almost irrelevant. The probability
    that benefits will outweigh costs when not prioritized is negligible, as highlighted
    by the fact that companies have to work very hard to make this positive when all
    those other considerations are ignored.
