- en: Business cycles and the essence of long-run economic growth are distinct issues.
    Preventing recessions is not the key to growth, as these are regrettable but unavoidable
    companions to an economy directed by a capital allocation process that is susceptible
    to systematic failure. Preventing the last failure is pretty irrelevant, because
    the next systematic failure will be different. Last I checked, only the US government
    is offering low-down payment loans, and no one offers no-documentation loans,
    so our government is not really helping here. As for creating growth via something
    new, if centralized governments could do that, the Soviet Union would still be
    around.

  zh: 商业周期和长期经济增长的本质是不同的问题。预防衰退并非是增长的关键，因为这些都是令人遗憾但不可避免的伴随着由容易受到系统性失败影响的资本分配过程引导的经济。预防上一次失败并不重要，因为下一次系统性失败会有所不同。据我所知，只有美国政府提供低首付贷款，也没有人提供无文件贷款，所以我们的政府在这方面并没有真正帮助。至于通过一些新的事物创造增长，如果中央集权的政府能够做到这一点，苏联还将存在至今。
- en: That decentralized, self-interested, people can collectively make such large
    errors seems irrational or corrupt to many, but they should remember that growing
    economies require people to be making things better, which means, new ways of
    doing things. New ideas are often wrong. Economics has gone onto intellectual
    cul-de-sacs many times (socialism, Keynesian macro models, input-output models,
    Hilbert spaces in finance, Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Kalman-filter macroeconomic
    models, etc.). Other scientific disciplines have their own mistakes, and political
    mistakes--stupid wars--are also common. These are rarely conspiracies, but rather,
    smart people making mistakes because the ideas that are true, important, and new,
    are really hard to discern, and tempting ones are alluring when lots of other
    seemingly successful people are doing them.

    fall significantly in nominal terms, because they had not for generations; people
    assumed anything related to the internet would make them rich in the internet

    gain the advantages of those with a real, unique and costly, comparative advantage.
    Every so often there are too many mimic Viceroy butterflies, not enough real poisonous
    Monarch ones, and a massive cataclysm occurs as predators ignore the unpleasant
    after-effects and start chomping on all of them. The Viceroy population grows
    until this devastating event occurs, a species recession. Next time, it won't
    happen in butterflies, but rather, among frogs or snakes. They key is, some ecological

- en: The key to wealth creation is doing more with less--destroying jobs at the micro
    level and creating jobs at the macro level by reallocating capital and labor to
    more valuable pursuits. The computer got rid of things from typesetters, secretaries,
    to engineers working with slide-rules, but these people didn't stay unemployed,
    they did something else, making the economic pie bigger. This is antithetical
    to government and unions who think creating a permanent 'job' creates productivity--stability
    at the micro level and stagnation at the macro level. Wealth is created by having
    decentralized decision-makers focused on simple goal of making money, which means,
    they oversee transactions where revenues collected are greater than expenses paid.

    (ie, productivity, wealth creation) merely maintain profits in a competitive environment;

    is a story I heard second-hand about a football player for Minnesota Vikings in
    the 1970s. Coach Bud Grant called this marginal player into a meeting, and said,
    ''Here''s what I need you to do...''. The player, an articulate fellow quite confident
    in himself, interrupted with an explanation of why he wasn''t doing better and
    suggestions about how to correct it, mainly focused what others were doing wrong.
    Grant cut him off: ''You don''t understand. This isn''t a negotiation. Do what
    I''m telling you, and you have a role here. Otherwise, you don''t.'' Hierarchies
    only work well when people have clearly defined goals, and managers who manage
    their direct reports singlemindedly.'

    rewarded with investment and retained earnings to the degree they do it well.
    When the government wants to do something, like build a light-rail system, it
    instead satisfies all its stakeholders who have no financial downside, only veto
    power, and so the cost/benefit calculus is almost irrelevant. The probability
    that benefits will outweigh costs when not prioritized is negligible, as highlighted
    by the fact that companies have to work very hard to make this positive when all
    those other considerations are ignored.
