    have reassured me that live pricing sheets driven by real time market data and
    hosted by Excel services will be possible. The solution is to code an RTD server
    that uses Excel’s web services API to kick off a recalc that will pull in the
    new data. Hope the managed code required by Excel Services doesn’t introduce too
    much latency.
