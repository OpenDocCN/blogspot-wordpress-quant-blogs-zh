    to get in the way. The latest BoAML Fund Manager Survey shows managers to be well

- en: Bank of America’s monthly survey of world fund-managers shows that investors
    have their second highest allocation to stock markets in thirteen years at 61pc.
    It is lead by shares in technology, energy, and even banks, and is stretched to
    a net 35pc overweight in Europe. “The summer 'melt-up' is likely to be followed
    by an autumn correction,” it said.

- en: Bank of America recommends four contrarian trades (for the brave only of course,
    nor for Welsh widows) based on herding effects. Go long bonds, and short equities;
    long the US dollar/ short sterling; long telecoms (the most reviled equity group),
    and short energy; and long emerging markets/short Eurozone.

    where there is not only "value", but a positive catalyst that propels the trade
    in the right direction. When I evaluate the four from a technical perspective,
    I find one to be in that category, two that appear to be nearing a trade setup
    and one in a wait-and-see mode.

    how EM equities have bottomed out and begun a relative rally against eurozone
    equities - that is the positive catalyst that I like to see.

    pull the trigger yet. Here is the long bond-short US equity pair chart below.
    Long Treasuries have broken out of a relative downtrend against US equities and
    they appear to be undergoing a sideways relative consolidation period. This is
    somewhat intriguing given the sentiment background, but I would wait until a relative
    breakout by bonds before making a significant commitment to this position.

    through a relative downtrend. While there may be some tactical short-term upside,
    these pairs typically undergoing a sideways consolidation period before staging
    a relative upside breakout.

    is still in an uptrend. At the very least, wait for the break through the trend-line
    before shorting Sterling.

    long or short positions. Combining sentiment analysis with inter-market technical
    analysis is another way to see the progression of how the trade may be setting
    up and can be useful in timing entry and exit points.
