# Quantifiable Edges: Large Gaps Down After 3 Up Days

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/08/large-gaps-down-after-3-up-days.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/08/large-gaps-down-after-3-up-days.html#0001-01-01)

This volatility continues this morning with a big gap down. The study below shows performance for the day following large gaps that occur after 3 consecutive up days.

These stats do not appear encouraging for the bulls.  Below I have listed all instances.

This view isn't any better.  It appears there is some potential for another ugly day. I'd use caution buying today.
