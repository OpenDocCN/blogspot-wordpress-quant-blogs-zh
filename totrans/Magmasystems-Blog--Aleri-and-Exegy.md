# Magmasystems Blog: Aleri and Exegy

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/aleri-and-exegy.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/aleri-and-exegy.html#0001-01-01)

At last week's

***Accelerating Wall Street***

conference, it was interesting to see that

**Aleri**

brought Scott Parsons from

**Exegy**

as their guest.

It was well publicized in the Wall Street press that

**Hyperfeed**

had sued

Exegy

over

alleged

misdeeds surrounding a botched merger attempt, something that resulted in

Hyperfeed

going out of business.

To me, a large lawsuit looming over a company like

Exegy

can bring into question the continued survival of

Exegy

, should

Hyperfeed

prevail. I went to Google in order to see if there was any settlement in this lawsuit, and according to the link below, there was an attempt at a settlement, but nothing ever resulted.

,

Aleri

and

Exegy

have a relationship. However, if I was at a large bank, and I was presented with an

Aleri

-

Exegy

solution, I would really have to do some extreme due

diligence

in the matter. In fact, until this lawsuit was resolved, I would have to be off my rocker to buy anything with

Exegy

in it.

Exegy

is backed by

[The Acartha Group](http://www.acarthagroup.com/)

. I am wondering if

Acartha

is looking to add a

CEP

company to their portfolio of companies. I would not be surprised.
