- en: Many asset management firms are happily enjoying record revenue and profits
    driven not by inorganic growth or skillful portfolio management but by a seemingly
    endless increase in US equity prices. These firms are effectively commodity producers
    entirely dependent on the price of an index over which the firm has no control.
    The options market presents an easy, cheap, and liquid form of protection in the
    form of puts with which the firm could hedge its revenues, its clients, or both.
    However, many of these firms in blissful disregard for the brutality of asymmetric
    arithmetic choose to ignore this opportunity for protection.
