- en: the first chart shows the relative ratio of XLE (Energy Select SPDR ETF) to
    SPY (S&P 500 SPDR ETF). As you can see the Energy sector has been in a long term
    relative uptrend against the market, as defined by the S&P 500\. As oil prices
    approached $100 and pulled back, so did the Energy relative to the market.

    mutual funds. These 22 funds can be thought of as a composite of the S&P 500-like
    mandate funds from the largest mutual fund complexes. As you can see from the
    chart, mutual funds moved from a significant overweight to a neutral/underweight
    position in the Energy sector.
