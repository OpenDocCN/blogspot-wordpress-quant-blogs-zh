# Humble Student of the Markets: Waiting for Santa Claus

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/11/waiting-for-santa-claus.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/11/waiting-for-santa-claus.html#0001-01-01)

**Trend Model signal summary**

Trend Model signal: Neutral

Trading model: Bullish

The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading model component of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below.

**Update schedule**

: I generally update Trend Model readings on

[my blog](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/)

on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent.

**Good news and bad news**

The market action last week saw some good news and some bad news. The bad news came in the form of weakness in the Greater China equity markets, but that was offset by the goods news of upside breakouts in Europe and a positive relative strength showing by US small caps. When I net it all out, I remain constructive that equity bulls will see another visit from Santa Claus this year.
