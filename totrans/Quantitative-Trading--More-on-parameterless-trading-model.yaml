    the technique is so general that it can be applied to any mean-reverting strategy.

    proportional to the distance between a supposedly mean-reverting measure and its
    long-term mean value.'

    between PEP and KO is mean-reverting, then this spread is the mean-reverting measure
    you should employ.

    in equal dollar amount. And as the spread reverts, keep selling (or buying) the
    spread in the same dollar amount. What this dollar amount should be depends on:
    a) the total buying power you possess, b) the expected maximum deviation of the
    spread from its mean, and c) how often you intend to buy/short. Note that point
    c is not a parameter: it is arbitrary and limited only by transaction costs, technology,
    and other operational issues. As for the expected maximum deviation, it can be
    obtained by observing the history of the spread since inception.'

    the possibility of data-snooping bias. (You may still want to impose an entry
    threshold based on transaction cost consideration - but that would not count as
    a free parameter.)
