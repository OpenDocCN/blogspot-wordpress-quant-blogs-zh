- en: I have had a number of subscribers ask me to extend the chart of my longer term
    calls, which had only gone back two years. The chart below shows the highlights
    of my posts back to 2013, which are intended for investors with a 6-24 month time
    horizon. I haven't been always right. On occasion, I was early, late, or simply
    mistaken.

    designed for traders with a 1-2 week time horizon. Again, I haven't been always
    right. The most recent failure occurred when the trading model got caught long
    (and wrong) in the correction in late 2015.
