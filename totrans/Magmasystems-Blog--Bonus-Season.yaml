    the numbers of an average bonus of over $600,000 per employee. But the whispers
    that I have heard from a number of people are that the IT employees below Managing
    Director level did not fare very well.

    we are speculating whether most Wall Street companies will turn off the bonus
    spout, and admonish employees to "Just try to go anywhere else! Nobody is hiring
    now!".

    lowest performers. I am going long in the steak-knife manufacturers.

    worker in the IT field. These are the people who score in the middle of the road
    on their yearly evaluations, the people who have been at a company long enough
    to know one system inside and out, the people who don't blog nor read blogs, the
    people who don't work on weekends and who don't think about the next great product
    that they want to write for the traders. These are the people that usually hold
    the keys to the systems and the data, the people who you need to convince to open
    the gates to your applications. Giving these people the doughnut bonus will slow
    down processes, resulting in further roadblocks for the people who do want to
    get things done.
