    to support a startup](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2006/001250.html),
    and whether such an ecology could be fostered in Europe. I’m intrigued by the
    comment at the end “Amsterdam … may just succeed while London isn’t looking.”
    Which reads to me as assuming that London has pole position in European startups,
    possibly a natural assumption for an American to make, as London is the financial
    centre of Europe, and is English speaking.'

    start up centre. In London hacker types are drawn into banks to work on trading
    systems by the excess remuneration. Start ups can’t compete on salaries. Consider
    New York: all the coders are working on Wall St.'

    is the centre of a lot of activity in the [business park](http://www.cambridge-business-park.co.uk/)
    & [MS Research has an office](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/cambridge/)
    there. [Autonomy](http://www.autonomy.com/content/home/) and [ARM](http://www.arm.com)
    are recent Cambridge success stories. The Thames Valley hosts a lot of software
    activity too.

    companies are focused on verticals. ARM and Autonomy are exceptions in cutting
    across sectors and having the horizontal reach and scale that generate really
    big pay offs. Before I worked in finance, I spent several years with UK ISVs that
    were world leaders in mechanical engineering and petroleum production software.
    They were more typical of the UK start up scene. Both were businesses founded
    in the 80s.
