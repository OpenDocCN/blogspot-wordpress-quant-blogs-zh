# SQL Azure CTP | Tales from a Trading Desk

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/sql-azure-ctp/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/sql-azure-ctp/#0001-01-01)

## SQL Azure CTP

I got my [SQL Azure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee336279.aspx) CTP invitation over the weekend. Obviously I want to use the CTP to experiment more with CloudTrader, unfortunately the current problem is finding time üò¶

On the subject of CTP‚Äôs, I see the next [.NET Service Bus CTP](http://blogs.msdn.com/netservices/archive/2009/09/18/update-on-the-next-microsoft-net-services-ctp.aspx) is due very soon. Hopefully this release will help to move CloudTrader forwards a little.
