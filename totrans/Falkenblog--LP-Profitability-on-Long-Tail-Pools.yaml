- en: The crypto bull market is back, best exemplified by worthless meme coins PEPE
    and Shiba rising to market caps of $3B and $21B, respectively. These types of
    coins have lottery-like payoffs, making them enticing buys when crypto bros are
    flush with 'house money.' They could also highlight a worst-case scenario for
    liquidity providers (LPs), who are short volatility.

- en: This is another example of the positive volatility/return correlation unique
    to crypto. In standard asset classes, higher volatility is correlated with negative
    returns, which is why a long volatility position has a negative beta in equity
    markets, and loses money on average (e.g., see VXX etf). An LP to a standard automated
    market maker (AMM) is short volatility, in that their best case scenario, the
    price stays put. LPs generally lose money when a token rises 50% in a single day.

    and the latest Total Locked Value. Pepe is the most profitable pool. However,
    it has only $5MM in TVL. The Chainlink-ETH pool has been unprofitable for the
    past year, and Matic and Shiba pools might have become unprofitable, given their
    performance over the past five months. As per the big price spike, Shiba lost
    a bundle, while Pepe has had a good month so far. On average, higher volatility
    does seem to hurt LPs, but not necessarily.

    LP positions once a day. To see how this was calculated, take as an example the
    pool inflows for the PEPE pool on March 4, when Shiba rose 53% (Pepe and Shiba
    prices are hard to read because they have so many zeros between the decimal and
    the first natural number, but it''s actually a smart move because I''ve seen several
    people post about how much money they would make if the price moved up to merely
    one penny):'

- en: This profitability analysis looks at the total amount of Shiba and ETH going
    into and out of the pool. When examined daily, it is equivalent to assuming LPs
    hedge once a day. The nice thing about this is that you do not need the 'liquidity'
    number or look at LP mints and burns to calculate LP profitability. The net inflows
    include fees, creating an 'all-in' profitability metric for a hedged LP. On this
    day, the LPs took in $1.04MM worth of ETH and sent out $1.25MM worth of Pepe tokens
    for a net loss of $214k.

    to identify the characteristics of profitable LP pools, one might think volume
    is key. Yet, looking at the volume data below, we see Pepe has a relatively high
    volume, and the LPs in the Pepe-ETH pool have done well, unlike the other popular
    pools. Volume rose significantly in the Link pool, but this coincides with its
    move to unprofitability.

    USDC-ETH pool trades less than the Pepe pool, and the money-losing BTC-ETH pool
    trades less than the Matic-ETH pool.

- en: Profitable capital-efficient AMM pools are not exactly unicorns, but they aren't
    rats either (mooses?). A lot of development is aimed at better user interfaces
    and connections to other AMMs (composability), but these will not address the
    LP unprofitability problem. In the long run, we cannot assume people will want
    to provide liquidity if they lose money. Airdrop rewards are not a sustainable
    strategy.

- en: Development proceeds as if current AMMs are profitable, as there is no reason
    to restate and amplify an asset that loses money. The key to this thinking is
    that these LP convexity costs do not really exist. Some think it compares to an
    unrealizable ideal, the perfectly hedged position (see [here](https://twitter.com/llamaonthebrink/status/1764510825677574395)). The
    standard way to present the abstruse convexity cost is to compare the LP's position
    with his initial position. Applying this to daily data is like assuming the LP
    hedges his position once a day. It is not an impossible benchmark like a frictionless
    medium, as obviously, the LP owned that position at inception.

    For example, as in the recent case of Shiba LPs, the cost is forgone profit instead
    of actual losses (for LPs that don't hedge). Shiba rose 53% on March 4, generating
    a loss of $214k, assuming the LP hedged. Is missing an upside really a loss?

    (option premium paid to you). If Apple's price doubles, you will not lose money;
    you will just miss out on capital gain. If you think that loss is merely hypothetical,
    remember why someone paid you for that option, so the buyer thinks it's real money;
    in cash-settled markets, on expiration, you have to send the option buyer real
    money if it expires in the money. The fact that many people don't consider this
    expense highlights the ignorance of most people selling gamma ([Ribbon finance](https://app.ribbon.finance/)
    presents its options assuming the earnings premium is pure profit, presented as
    an APY like a bond yield).

    just this morning, several Uniswap researchers [released an academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367)
    proposing an auction mechanism to 'reduce losses to informed order flow.' They
    do not state LPs are unprofitable, but it's a step in the right direction (see
    my take [here](https://bit.ly/3wLQee9)).

- en: 'One point mentioned in that paper noted prior work on dynamic fees to reduce
    LP losses. Intuitively, this makes sense, generating the best of both worlds:
    low fees on average and high fees when prices are spiking. However, this fix is
    unlikely, given the losses for the 5 and 30-basis point fee Uniswap pools targeting
    the same pairs (see below). Indeed, the average loss on the higher fee pools is
    greater, highlighting the problem with assuming volume is exogenous.'
