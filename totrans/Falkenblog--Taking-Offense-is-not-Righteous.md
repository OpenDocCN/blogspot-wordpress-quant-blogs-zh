# Falkenblog: Taking Offense is not Righteous

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/taking-offense-is-not-righteous.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/taking-offense-is-not-righteous.html#0001-01-01)

Curiously, a former definition of impoliteness has become a new focal point for all sorts of political and psychological offense.  I remember Miss Manners noting that politeness has two, related, sides: not giving 

*or taking*

 unintentional offense. That's clearly old school. There seems to be a public bounty for perceiving slights, and lots of columnists are full-time commentators noting the latest injustice to their tribe (eg,

on right). There's a website called

[MicroAggression](http://www.microaggressions.com/)

s documenting slights felt by people who don't appreciate the guy who opened or failed to open the door for them. Interestingly, the more they talk about things, the more people get upset by people getting upset

*ad infinitum*

 One of my favorite scientists 

[Michael Gazzaniga](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/gazzaniga-on-preferences.html)

writes about a study by

[Kleck and Strenta (1980)](http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Kleck,_R._E.,_%26_Strenta,_A._(1980)._Perceptions_of_the_impact_of_negatively_valued_physical_characteristics_on_social_interaction._Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology,_39(5),_861-873.)

  that showed how our left-brain interpreter is driven to seek explanations for events. In the study the subjects had a scar applied to their face with makeup, which they observed in a mirror. They were told that they were going to have a discussion with another person, and that the experimenter was interested in whether the other person's behavior would be affected by the subject's scar. The subject was instructed to note any behavior that they thought was a reaction to the scar. At the last moment the experimented said he had to moisturize the scar to prevent it from cracking, and then surreptitiously removed the scar.

When shown a video of the other person's facial reaction taken during the discussion, the subjects reported being treated horribly, and noted things like looking away. Their reality was based on two faulty pieces of information: 1) they had a scar and 2) their conversation partner glancing away more than usual. If you give people a good reason to believe someone is biased against them, they will perceive that bias regardless.

Unfortunately, no one talks about that study, but rather the more agreeable stereotype threat research that reinforces the notion that institutional racism powerfully discourages groups like

, and

[moms](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/moms-stress-stereotype-threat/story?id=18669453)

, into performing stereotypically   The idea here is that if you prime subjects to do poorly on a

test, they will conform to the stereotype statistically.

A key to good mental health includes the art of not being offended. To do this, you should see that every statement, action and reaction of another human being as the sum result of their total life experience to date, and so it really has very little to do with you. To the extent they are implying you are a knave, fool, or tool, it usually has more to do with them than you, especially in contacts with people one doesn't really know (eg, cops, waiters, teachers).

We are often stand-ins, the chess pieces of life to which others have their own built-in reactions. When we provide no Velcro for it to stick, something changes in the world, and most importantly, you aren't brought down thinking about the implications of some poorly thought-out actions.  Contemplating or correcting those with bad thoughts is like staying up late trying to make sure no one is wrong on the internet. Though it may take a lifetime of practice, a thick skin is truly one of the best kept secrets for living a happy life.

Unfortunately, people today are taught the opposite, to find slights based on whatever angle gives them their greatest insecurity or platform, which somehow will bring justice to the world. It's really a bad meme, counterproductive for the individual and society.
