    equity markets and find that this relation is flat, or even negative. This is
    inconsistent with theoretical models such as the CAPM, which predict a positive
    relation, but consistent with the results of studies which have previously examined
    the empirical relation between risk and return in the U.S. and other developed
    equity markets.

    and create long-short portfolios based on the extremum quintiles. The result is
    a percent return number that is independent of any currency fluctuations. Total
    volatility as a sorting criteria works better than better than beta, but they
    have similar results. The effects are not concentrated in the smaller cap stocks,
    though clearly excluding these firms lessens the effect (ie, if only because the
    extremums within 200 stocks are less than extremums within 400 stocks). If there
    was ever a strong rejection of a theory, this is it, as 17 out of 19 countries
    showing low volatility stocks outperforming high volatility stocks.  So, it exists
    in the US back to 1926, and in 95+% of other markets in their various time samples
    (in this paper, generally 1989-2010).  That's a pretty clear pattern. Perhaps
    now we can move on to the more interesting question of why this happens, and what
    this means for standard asset pricing theory.
