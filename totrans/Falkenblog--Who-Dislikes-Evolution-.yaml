    races of man, and I think it''s a great way to show my kids what different people
    look like. For example, the different types of Asians (Japanese vs. Korean), something
    my kids won''t learn very easily elsewhere. It is funny that while we celebrate
    diversity, books like this are considered racist, a totally inconsistent position.
    It seems the primary virtue my kids learn in school is related to diversity. But
    if everyone is the same, why all the emphasis on the race of Africans, or American
    Indians? Its like saying that diversity of religion is great, but that the differences
    in religion do not matter. My kids learn early that inconsistency is an important
    part of any human set of axioms.'

    implies being non-gay, or non-Scandinavian, is less. Or, you mean everything is
    great, in which case nothing is. There is nothing wrong with being gay or Scadinavian,
    just nothing great, either. I think it is causing a lot of confusion to highlight
    differences as 'necessarily good' because we all know it is not so. Everything
    different is not necessarily good, and even a child knows this.

    a community of more or less endogamous isolates engaged principally in trades
    and professions requiring high intelligence, for which they have been pruned.
    It requires no statistics here...to state that the Jews have contributed far more
    than their numerical share of the world's geniuses in many fields...This is in
    part explained by the fact that it has long been a practice to marry bright young
    men destined for the rabbinate to rich merchants' daughters and to encourage them
    to have large families.

    no one would actively seek out what happened to Charles Murray when he put out

    because of the current zeitgeist. We should not be afraid of the truth, because
    not looking for it doesn't make it go away.
