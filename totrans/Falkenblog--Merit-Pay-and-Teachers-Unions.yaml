    degrees, because the unions do not want to give someone power to evaluate actual
    performance. In 2002, the Los Angeles Board of Education tried to remove 400 of
    the 35,000 teachers in a low performing district: in the end they were able to
    remove 3 (Policy Review, April 2004, page 26).'

    In theory you can emulate the benefits of competition via trial and error and
    internal evaluation of costs and benefits at the margin. In practice, insiders
    simply protect their turf and nothing fundamental changes when they are evaluating
    their own productivity.

    of competition, not introspection by self-interested producers.
