    followed by a tame PPI report and strong retail sales print. Even before these
    reports, [Mohamed El-Erian](https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1721947719550300631)
    issued a warning about the goldilocks scenario of lower oil prices and falling
    bond yields.

    ahead? To answer that question, one useful way of seeing the world is through
    the lens of last week’s meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on the sidelines
    of the APEC Summit in San Francisco. The U.S. and China met to stabilize their
    relationship, but each is coming to the table with deep wounds, which are useful
    in evaluating potential weakness that could affect the global economy. The actual
    progress made at the meeting was modest, but it’s less important inasmuch as what
    it revealed about the vulnerabilities of each economy to the growth risks highlighted
    by El-Erian.
