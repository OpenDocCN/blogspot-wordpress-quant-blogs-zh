    in a very hands on learning session covering many of the topics I've posted about
    (and many other areas, such as how to deal with over/under fitting). Kudos to
    Dr. Ng for a fantastic, engaging, and informative course.

    to programming (via Octave), which are very useful in languages such as Python
    and R.
