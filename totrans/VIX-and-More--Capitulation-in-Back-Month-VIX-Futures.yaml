    I suggested that it was coming, but I never expected it to happen in such dramatic
    fashion.

    collapsed today without any movement in the front month VIX futures.

- en: 'For those who are fixated on the cash VIX and the first two months of VIX futures,
    the movement in the November through May VIX futures chronicled below probably
    looks unremarkable, as proportional as it is, but that is exactly the point: the
    VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    almost never moves in uniform proportions. Typically the front month moves the
    most, the second month may move half as month as the front month, the third month
    half as much as the second month and so on. See the links at the bottom for some
    examples.'

    VIX futures held steady at 20.65, indicating that market participants see the
    likely October settlement for the VIX one week from tomorrow at about 1.58 points
    above the current level.

    is calling for a short-term rise in the VIX, there was an almost audible sigh
    of, “Oops, we have this one wrong…” when it comes to the longer-term outlook for
    the VIX.

    a record degree of divergence, some considerable opportunities are presented.
    As I have spelled out in a number of instances lately, my thinking has been that
    the back month volatility will likely collapse in order to bring the present and
    the future back into line. There has been some evidence of that happening during
    the past two days, but I anticipate that long-term volatility expectations will
    continue to decline.”*'

    one of how low the distant month volatility in the VIX futures will fall. Back
    in April it went as low as the 23s. Today the distant month VIX futures dipped
    below the 30 level for the first time since June. The May 2011 futures are already
    down 2.85 points (8.7%) this month and if they are to match April’s levels, there
    are still another 6 points left to fall.

    Perhaps I should have more company…
