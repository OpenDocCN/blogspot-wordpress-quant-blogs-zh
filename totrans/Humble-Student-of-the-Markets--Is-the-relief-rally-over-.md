# Humble Student of the Markets: Is the relief rally over?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/08/is-relief-rally-over.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/08/is-relief-rally-over.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 16-Aug-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on Twitter at @humblestudent and on Mastodon at @humblestudent@toot.community. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### Sell the news?

Last week, I suggested that the stock market was ripe for a relief rally in the context of a deeper correction. The rally duly arrived. One of the main events was the earnings report from Nvidia, which blew the doors off Street expectations both on sales and earnings. The market reacted with Nvidia failing to hold its overnight gains. More importantly, the Semiconductor Index weakened below a key relative support level.

Is this a case of buy the rumour, sell the news? What does that mean about the short-term direction for stock prices. Is the relief rally over and a deeper correction about to begin?
