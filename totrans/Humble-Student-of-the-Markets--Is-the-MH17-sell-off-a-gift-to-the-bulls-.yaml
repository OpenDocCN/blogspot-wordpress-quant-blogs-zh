    ratio, which is a measure of the term structure of VIX, moved from a normally
    upward sloping term structure to inversion indicating a spike in fear levels.
    As the bottom panel of the chart below shows, the VIX-VXV term structure soared
    well above 1\. I have also indicated with vertical lines past instances where
    the term structure inverted. With the exception of episodes in 2008, 2009 (Lehman
    Crisis) and 2011 (eurozone crisis and US budget impasse), past instances of VIX
    inversion have marked low-risk entry points into stocks.
