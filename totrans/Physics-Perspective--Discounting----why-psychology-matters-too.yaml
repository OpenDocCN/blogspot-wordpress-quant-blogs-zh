    brief discussion. He asked me not to "ignore the psychology of discounting," i.e.
    the realistic aspects of human behaviour that really determine how we discount
    the future, whether or not that behaviour conforms to some "rational" paradigm.

- en: My view is that I couldn't agree more. I didn't mention psychology in the Bloomberg
    piece for two reasons. First, for lack of space (900 words), and second, so as
    to give greater emphasis to the mathematical angle, this being where traditional
    economists feel they are on the firmest ground. Point to the fact that real people
    (and many other animals as well) in experiments don't seem to follow exponential
    discounting, but something weaker, and the hard-nosed economist will simply respond
    by saying this only shows that "people are irrational, and we can learn to act
    more rationally with logic."

- en: Hence, whatever the importance of psychology, I thought it was important to
    bring out this one argument against exponential discounting, as it rests on the
    same dry logic that economists thought supported their position. It doesn't. What
    economists are currently doing is irrational. That should raise some serious questions
    about how cost-benefit analyses may be leading us to undervalue the future in
    a hundred settings.

    to the work of psychologist Shane Frederick of Yale University. I happen to know
    of Frederick as I use one of his past experiments on framing effects in some writing
    seminars I give (along with my colleague Justin Mullins) to Ph.D. students. The
    puzzle is:'

    answer is 5 cents. The immediate, intuitive part of our brain pulls us toward
    the 10-cent response, and we have to use the slow deliberate part of our brain
    to get the right answer. If I recall the numbers correctly, Frederick did this
    experiment with students at Princeton University and University of Michigan, giving
    them something like 15 minutes to respond, and roughly half still gave the wrong
    answer. I use this to instill in students how important the structure of their
    writing is -- it's not only what you say, but how you say it, and saying it the
    wrong way creates a puzzle for your readers.

    respond to discounting questions. Very briefly: Some earlier experiments suggested
    that people, when asked how they value a life now versus one in the future, give
    a lot more value to the present life. The numbers ranged from 45 lives to more
    than 200 lives 100 years from now being worth the same amount as one life now.
    This was taken as evidence of strong discounting in the psychological make-up
    of people.'

    depend very strongly on how you ask the question. Frame it in one way and you
    get evidence of strong discounting, frame it in another and people weigh lives
    100 years in the future equal to those today. As he notes, the results are all
    down to the "elicitation procedures" used by the experimenter:'

    evoke (or suppress) several distinct considerations or criteria relevant to the
    evaluation of such life saving programs (e.g., uncertainty, efficiency, and distributional
    equity), and because they produce, to different extents, experimental demand effects:
    cues about what a reasonable answer should be.'

    show such evidence. Referring to one of the most prominent such papers, Frederick

    than this generation” or anything that suggests “ethical values” or “kinship”
    or a diminished concern for future people. In the study presented here, respondents
    were not requested to explain their answers, but were invited to comment on the
    questions or their answers if they wished. These comments suggest reasons similar
    to those listed above. Many respondents refused to believe that the future deaths
    would actually occur (e.g., “We’ll figure out a way to save lives in the future,”
    “Technology will change and guarantee higher survival rates,” “In 100 years, a
    solution might be found to save the life.”). Others were dubious of the long term
    commitment by the government needed to ensure that the future programs would be
    instituted (e.g., “I don’t trust long term projects in the hands of government
    agencies which are subject to political whims.”). None of the 29 people who offered
    written justifications for their choice indicated that they felt less concern
    for, or empathy toward, or kinship with future people.
