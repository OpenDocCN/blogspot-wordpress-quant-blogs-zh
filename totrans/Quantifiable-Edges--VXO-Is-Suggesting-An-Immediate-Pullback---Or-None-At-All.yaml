- en: Thursday we again saw the VIX and VXO close well below their recent mean.  Such
    stretches suggest a collapse in fear among investors.  The study below was last
    seen in the 10/21/13 subscriber letter. It looks for stretches of 15% or more
    that have persisted for three days.

- en: Based on the stats table there appears to be a downside inclination. I find
    the note at the bottom of the study to be especially interesting. Nearly every
    case has experienced an almost immediate pullback, but those that didn't went
    without pulling back for a long time.
