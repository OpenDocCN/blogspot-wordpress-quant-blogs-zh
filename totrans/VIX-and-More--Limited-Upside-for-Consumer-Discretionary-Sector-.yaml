- en: As Corey at [Afraid to Trade](http://blog.afraidtotrade.com/) pointed out in
    [Some Surprising Trend Day Action](http://blog.afraidtotrade.com/some-surprising-trend-day-action/),
    one of the more interesting sub-plots in yesterday’s breakout was the strength
    in the consumer discretionary sector, which rallied 5.8%.

    unless consumer confidence, consumer purchasing power and consumer activity all
    rally in concert with the markets.

- en: My concern with the consumer discretionary sector extends to a chart of the
    sector ETF, [XLY](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xly).  In the weekly chart
    below, the current level of the XLY (33.55 as I type this) is now back to the
    32-34 area bounded by the [symmetrical triangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/symmetrical%20triangle)
    formation of 2005-2006 and is also rapidly approaching the 34.08 50% [Fibonacci](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fibonacci)
    retracement level.  Both of these indicators suggest that the XLY should find
    considerable resistance in the 34-35 area; if this is the case, the market will
    have to rely on other sectors to continue the current bull rally.
