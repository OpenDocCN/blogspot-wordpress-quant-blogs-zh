    the relative merits and costs of such tools at our August meeting. We will continue
    to consider those and other pertinent issues, including of course economic and
    financial developments, at our meeting in September, which has been scheduled
    for two days (the 20th and the 21st) instead of one to allow a fuller discussion.
    The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming
    information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate to promote a stronger
    economic recovery in a context of price stability.

- en: The Kennedy Administration’s proposed solution to this dilemma was to try to
    lower longer-term interest rates while keeping short-term interest rates unchanged—an
    initiative now known as “Operation Twist” in homage to the dance craze then sweeping
    the nation. The idea was that business investment and housing demand were primarily
    determined by longer-term interest rates, while cross-currency arbitrage was primarily
    determined by short-term interest rate differentials across countries. Policymakers
    reasoned that, if longer-term interest rates could be lowered without affecting
    short-term yields, the weak U.S. economy could be stimulated without worsening
    the outflow of gold.

    program. If homeowners pay off their mortgages and refinance, that will create
    tremendous cash flows to MBS holders. The Fed happens to hold about $1T in MBS
    and all these pre-payments will give the Fed money to do an Operation Twist and
    buy in the long end of the curve without expanding their balance sheet. If they
    hold $1T in MBS and pre-pays are sufficiently high, then

    This would spark a QE2-style rally in risky assets.

- en: Upon some more sober reflection, I realized that there are major drawbacks to
    this scheme inasmuch it is unlikely to have a significant effect on asset prices.
    First of all, major MBS holders are Fannie, Freddie and the Fed (3F). Most mortgage
    backed securities are priced at a premium and this re-fi program will pay investors
    off at par. Thus, 3F will be taking a substantial loss on their holdings.

- en: There is another problem. Suppose that this re-fi program generates $X billion
    in pre-payments which get re-financed. Then $X billion of MBS supply will come
    back into the market. One of the ways that QE2 pushed up asset prices was because
    it ballooned the Fed balance sheet by pushing a wall of liquidity out into the
    market. This program is more of a variation of Operation Twist, which extends
    the Fed balance sheet out to the longer end of the yield curve, but at a cost.
    Depending on how it's implemented, I could see substantial movement in credit
    spreads but don't expect QE2-like effects.

- en: Moreover, it isn't clear to me what the sustainable benefits there to flattening
    the yield curve. The last FOMC meeting statement indicating that rates would stay
    low for another two years encouraged financial institutions to get long the carry
    trade of borrowing short and lending long. An Operation Twist, or Super-Twist,
    that flattens the yield curve undoes some of those benefits - though it does provide
    an immediate boost to investors who are already positioned in the longer end of
    the Treasury curve.

    to the Fed to re-deploy on its balance sheet, which would be bullish. On the other
    hand, it could also decide that this program is net neutral to negative because
    of the costs involved.
