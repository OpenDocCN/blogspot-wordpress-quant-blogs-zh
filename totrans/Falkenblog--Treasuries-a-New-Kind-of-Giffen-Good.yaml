    For a select few inferior goods the income effect is so large it overwhelms the

    substitution effect relative to other assets. But everyone is now poorer, as with
    $60T or so in present valued unfunded promises, the AA+ downgrade is about a 0.1%
    increase in our discount rate, and that's about a $1T drop in our net worth. This
    income effect is so large, the relative value of Treasuries increases because

    via the income effect's effect on the substitution effect, so it's not a traditional
    Giffen good, rather, a 'Geithner good.'
