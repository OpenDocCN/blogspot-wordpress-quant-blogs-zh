    at this moment a large portion of my portrolio consists of short TWTR position,
    so my opinion is rather skewed. The reason I''ve done my own analysis is that
    my bet did not work out well, and Twitter made a parabolic move in December 2013\.
    So the question that I''m trying to answer here is "should I take my loss or hold
    on to my shorts?".'

    B$. Up till now the company has not made any profit, loosing 142M$ in 3013 after
    making 534M$ in revenues. The last two numbers give us yearly company spendings
    of 676M$.

- en: GOOG has been excelling at extracting ad revenue from its users. To do that,
    it has a set of highly diversified offerings, from search engine to Google+ ,
    Docs and Gmail. TWTR has nothing resembling that, while its value per user is
    only 35% lower thatn that of Google.
  prefs:

- en: TWTR has a limited room to grow its user base as it does not offer products
    comparable to FB or GOOG offerings. TWTR has been around for seven years now and
    most people wanting an accout have got their chance. The rest just does not care.

    professional market. By this metric TWTR would be **overvalued.** Setting user
    value at 100$ for TWTR would produce a fair TWTR **price of 46 $.**
