- en: Utility of quantitative finance often arises in unexpected places. An example
    is employee stock options (ESO). Specifically, a surprising number of ESO planning
    questions boil down to dynamic hedging and its relationship to financial, tax,
    and/or regulatory considerations.

    (including potential for multiple partials of each), and *what quantities for
