- en: No, it’s not a scoop. I didn’t find a new wireless [microwave or laser or whatever] network
    around Wall Street. In 2016, “Wall Street” means New Jersey as most of the Wall
    Street exchanges has moved into data centers far from the old New York Stock Exchange
    building. The NYSE’s matching engine is in Mahwah; BATS and Direct Edge’s matching
    engines in Secaucus; and Nasdaq’s matching engine in Carteret. This area is now
    known as “The Equity Triangle”. This Equity Triangle is quite interesting; thanks
    to millimeter waves and laser networks, prices are moving fast – very very fast,
    we talk about microseconds here. For instance it only takes *94 microseconds*
    for data to be sent from Carteret to Secaucus, and given that it takes only ~1
    microsecond for a co-located trader at one exchange to get news of a fill (order
    confirmation), each microsecond counts. We are in a very latency-sensitive area. An
    ongoing study on this Equity Triangle tends to show that because Secaucus is situated
    centrally between Carteret and Mahwah, trading at BATS/DE seems to drive price
    formation in the triangle. More to come about that.

- en: The controversy around the “speed race” has been revived in recent years as new
    kind of technologies (microwaves, laser) are now used by high-frequency traders
    to get information (market data) at “the speed of light”; for some this “speed
    race” is seen as “socially wasteful”, but others argue that those new technologies
    allow a better (and faster) arbitrage between price differences (particularly
    in the Equity Triangle as – for instance – Apple share prices may be different
    in Mahwah, Secaucus and Carteret). The recent projects of HFT firms Vigilant Global
    and New Line Networks (KCG + Jump Trading) in Richborough, UK, where both the
    companies seek to build two microwave towers as high as the Eiffel Tower, are more
    controversial than ever (check out my “[HFT in the Banana Land](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/hft-in-the-banana-land/)”
    series). But wireless networks being faster than fibre, microwaves seem to be
    the “new normal” if you want to trade fast between major stock exchanges (the
    microwave race is nearly over here in Europe, the new horizons are in Asia and
    India now). Wireless networks linking exchanges are here to stay, and it appears
    they are older than we may think. By chance, a few days ago I discovered the first
    wireless network that transmitted informations to Wall Street. It was not around
    2010 (when the first microwave communication system was set up between Chicago
    and New Jersey) but in… 1827\. Almost two centuries ago.

    NYSE) received a permission from the Tresury Department to deploy an [optic telegraph](https://books.google.be/books?id=9tnz8HPyCmMC&dq=sandy+hook+havesink+semaphore+telegraph&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s)
    from Navesink to Manhattan, using semaphores (as did the well-known Claude Chappe
    optic telegraph in Europe). The starting point of the network was at the Twin
    Lights Tower in Navesink, where a semaphore tower was added near the lighthouse.

- en: From the Navesink 70-feet high lighthouse located on the hill (a second lighthouse
    was erected mater), an agent was able to monitor the boats entering the Lower
    Bay using a telescopic devices. The agent could identify the name, size, signal
    flags, etc., of the boats, and that information was important for the Wall Street
    traders. If a ship laden with commodities was not in a good shape and lost some
    of its goods, this valuable information was awaited with impatience around Wall
    Street; the sooner information reached the Exchange, the sooner commodities prices
    changed.

- en: It was a 35,9-kilometer network (22,3 miles), roughly the distance between Secaucus
    and Mahwah, and it took 60 seconds for a message to arrive to the roof of the
    NYSE Manhattan from Navesink – an eternity compared to the HFT latencies (roughly
    calculated, if the network was set up in 2016 with microwaves dishes, a signal would
    travel in 120 μs between Navesink and Manhattan, that is 0.00012 seconds – but
    note that the old optic network was not really optimized as it’s far from the
    straight line between the two points).

    around the Twin Lights and the semaphore device (but not the tower) was replaced
    by an electric telegraph – “new technology” meant “a faster network” as the electric
    wires were incredibly fastest than the prehistoric optic network. We will have
    to wait till the 21th century to be back on wireless (microwaves), and the irony
    is that the first demonstration Guglielmo Marconi did in the US in 1899 to prove
    the efficiency of radio networks, using Tesla’s oscillators, occurred on the Navesink
    hill: Marconi choose the Twin Lights location “*because of the height. The hill
    here at Navesink had an excellent unobstructed view of the race course, and the
    early wireless were what they call line-of-sight radio waves. If the two ends
    couldn’t see the other, electronically they couldn’t communicate. So they needed
    to put the antenna on a high hill that had a direct visual line with the boat
    that Marconi was on*” (read the full story [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/nyregion/on-the-map-a-lighthouse-that-was-a-beacon-for-wireless-communication.html)).
    Interesting to see that the technology “invented” by Marconi  (information transmission
    through waves – the new normal in the HFT world) was tested exactly where the
    first wireless network dedicated to market data was set up with semaphores, six
    decades earlier.'

    now 1700 MacArthur Boulevard in Mahwah) but on 40 Wall Street. Back then the NYSE

    1930 it was the tallest building in the world… for a month – typically the kind
    of building HFT microwave providers love. But as the US exchanges are now in New
    Jersey (or around Chicago), there is no need for high towers in Manhattan. The
    old New York Stock Exchange building on 40 Wall Street, where the first wireless
    market data network was set up, has been replaced by a business tower. And who
    owns the building? Donald Trump. Times have changed.
