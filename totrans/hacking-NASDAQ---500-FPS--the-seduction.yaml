    trading tech for a while now. Its one of those things which grows and grows on
    you from a purely technical point of view like one of those mosquito bug zappers
    which hypnotically attract insects. Latency problems, throughput problems, hardware
    architecture, crazy ass server infrastructure, cycle counting, bit f00king and
    so on are all finally getting interesting. And my current excursion into entrepreneurship
    result is the obvious but from an tech point of view, depressing result. Entrepreneurship
    is about solving peoples problems NOT technical problems.

    its yourself or a small group going out into the blood bath that is the market
    to brawl with your foes computer systems where the only thing that matters is
    the PnL. no marketing, no sales, no clients, no support, no investors and not
    really a product either its all about is your tech faster and smarter than the
    competition. Its in stark contrast to entrepreneurship, which is about going out
    into the market to discover peoples problems, building solution to these peoples
    problem, getting people to use your solution and then getting people to pay. Not
    to mention cultivating a people network of relationships, building a team of people
    and so on.

    exploit it then ruthlessly execute for as long as possible. So as an introvert,
    hacker and tech centric person im being seduced by the notion trading is focused
    on tech, numbers and bits. Thus this blog is about testing the hypothesis to see
    where it all goes.
