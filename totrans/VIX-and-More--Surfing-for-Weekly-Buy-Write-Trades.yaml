    the recent spike in volatility in stocks is subsiding. That seems to be the case,
    as the VIX opened at 27.21 and is now just over 26.00.

    ([covered call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/covered%20calls))
    trades with the new [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly)

    the highest [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    stocks, ETFs and indices, then qualify these on liquidity terms, examine the proximity
    of the current price relative to the various strike prices, then review the charts
    for some of the finalists and add some sort of secret sauce at the end to come
    up with trades that fit my objectives.

    Ford ([F](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/F)) and Bank of America
