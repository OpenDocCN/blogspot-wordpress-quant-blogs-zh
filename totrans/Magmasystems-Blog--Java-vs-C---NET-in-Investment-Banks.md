# Magmasystems Blog: Java vs C#/.NET in Investment Banks

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/java-vs-cnet-in-investment-banks.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/java-vs-cnet-in-investment-banks.html#0001-01-01)

Although there are definite pockets of .NET development in most investment banks on Wall Street, the majority of the development efforts are still in Java, especially on the server side. This is nowhere more apparent than in the investment bank that I am currently working for.

I am becoming more and more impressed with the Open Software that has been developed for the Java community, and the I have been similarly impressed with the sense of comradery that the Java community has. Most of the interesting .NET tools have origins in the Java world (NUnit, Spring, Hibernate, etc).

One of my tasks in my current position is to look at what our company has in terms of client-side frameworks and to come up with a proposal for a company-wide framework. This means looking at the toolkits that various groups are using or currently developing, looking at what I have done in the past, and making some recommendations by taking the best-of-breed of the various efforts. In addition to looking at .NET frameworks, I have been asked to look at some of the Java frameworks. And, I have been impressed by some of the Java efforts.

Some people have even asked me to look at things like Eclipse RCP and the NetBeans RCP. Several of my colleagues have blogged in the past about the viability of Eclpise RCP as a client-side framework. I feel that I need to take a serious look at it.

You all know that I have been a staunch advocate of .NET in the past. However, I am finding it more difficult to beat back the Java supporters. Some of the arguments that I have used against Java in the past (slowness, not as nice a UI, etc) have been colored by my past experiences with AWT, Swing, and JFC. But, Java GUI development has definitely evolved.

I would love to hear from my blog readers as to why I should continue to push .NET over Java.

Some reasons that I can think of for preferring .NET over Java:

1) I feel C# is a stronger language, and will continue to evolve into an even more powerful entity.

2) Closeness of .NET to the O/S, especially when Vista comes out.

3) Support for .NET inside of SQL Server 2005.

4) Possible business reasons are Microsoft non-support of a JVM and the precarious nature of Sun's balance sheet.

5) Better integrations with the standards in desktop tools (Excel, Word, etc)
