    lives, but it is equivalent with 'benchmarking', which is endemic in investing.
    If all the professionals are benchmarking, you get the same result.

- en: for instance, take British Petroleum (BP). Their stock's implied volatility
    spiked up to 100%, well above its peers in the energy sector (around 25%). You
    might think, taking some of your exposure to BP would be prudent. Yet as BP represents
    $79B in market cap, if you are investing in the energy sector, having zero shares
    of BP generates the same benchmark risk and doubling down and having twice as
    much capital in BP as in the sector benchmark. Risk to BP is merely deviating
    from the consensus, which in this case is its proportional market cap as a percent
    of the energy sector.

    large cap, having cash vs. paying down your mortgage. All these allocations are
    relative to a benchmark portfolio, which is generally the average of what everyone
    else does.

    benchmarks, risk is deviating from the consensus, and thus taking too little exposure
    to any popular investment is just as risky as taking on a lot of exposure.'

- en: have a paper where the define portfolio manager risk this way. If risk is defined
    as a deviation from the benchmark, it becomes like idiosyncratic risk, unnecessary,
    so unpriced. Further, via arbitrage 'benchmark risk' can not be priced, because
    you can't get a risk premium from both having zero or twice the normal exposure
    to BP.
