    of the short-term VIX readings, where a reading of 31.6% below the 10 day SMA
    has only happened three times previously (1/91, 3/91 and 12/98.) The bottom line
    is a VWSI of +2, which is slightly bullish for the VIX, but technically still
    neutral enough as to preclude a formal directional recommendation.
