    warning. In a mailing to the staff, the partners said that there was just no business
    to be had for very smart .Net and Java consultants in Canary Wharf.

    I see a lone seaman, in a yellow raincoat, yelling "Ahoy Matey" to me from a distant
    pier? Are there thugs and holligans behind every dark corner, waiting to roll
    me for my wallet? Will I see row of cars, inhabited by hormonal teenagers, "watching
    the submarine races" (a popular saying in the 1950's)?

    organize a bile-night to keep me off the streets? Perhaps Rut the Nut is reading
    this blog and will get some of our old Citicorp/EBS gang together for a slosh-up?
