    liquidity to the market during "normal" markets (and the current market regime

    detect a large, long-lasting order right from the start and trade along with it,”
    van Kervel and Menkveld said. “We speculate that HFTs eventually feel the imbalance
    caused by it. In response, they trade out of their position as they understand
    that leaning against such order as a market maker requires a long-lasting inventory
    position. HFTs prefer to be flat at the end of the day.”

    and what it means to have fat tails and peakedness. The total area under a curve

    to think of a curve having three parts (all imaginary) – the peak, the shoulder
    (or the middle part), and the tails, you can imagine what happens if you stretch
    the peak up. That reduces variance, and probably sucks in ‘mass’ from the shoulders.
    But in order to keep the variance the same, the tails rise higher, increasing
    variance and also providing fatter tails.

    else has to reduce elsewhere – which means that the ‘shoulders’ shrink making
    the peak taller. In order to compare kurtosis between two curves, both must have
    the same variance. At the risk of being repetitive, note that the variance has
    an impact on the shape of a curve, in that the greater the variance the more spread
    out the curve is. When we say that kurtosis is relevant only when comparing to
    another curve with identical variance, it means that kurtosis measures something
    other than variance.

    back to 1990\. First, the median kurtosis is 1.34, indicating that stock returns
    have fatter tails than a typical normal distribution (and option traders using
    the Black-Scholes model, which is based on a normal distribution, know that fact
    well). As well, kurtosis has been falling since 2011, indicating that the tails
    are getting thinner. This is not unusual as there has been episodes in the past
    when kurtosis has been even lower than they are today.
