    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    bullish cup and saucer formation. If it achieves a decisive breakout at 2800,
    the upside target is about 2950*. In all likelihood, the upside breakout will
    occur, as there is strong breadth support as small cap, midcap, and NASDAQ indices
    all achieved all-time highs last week.

    nature of the leadership that investors should expect. A standard approach of
    using Relative Rotation Graph charting yielded some answers, but a further factor-based
    analysis indicated a surprising level of risk exposure.
