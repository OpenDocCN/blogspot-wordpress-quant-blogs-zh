- en: My Bloomberg column this month looks at an idea for improving the function of
    the interbank lending market. The idea is radical, yet also conceptually very
    simple. It's radical because it proposes a complete transformation of banking
    transparency. It shows how transparency may be the best route to achieving overall
    banking stability and efficiency. It will be interesting to see what free-market
    ideologues think of the idea, as it doesn't fit into any standard ideological
    narrative such as "get government out of the way" or "unregulated markets work
    best." It offers a means to improve market function -- something one would expect
    free-market cheerleaders to favor -- but does so in a way that threatens banking
    secrecy and also involves some central coordination.

    that they consider here not all markets, but specifically the interbank market,
    in which banks loan funds to one another to manage demands for liquidity. This
    is the market that famously froze up following the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
    as banks suddenly realized they had no understanding at all of the risks facing
    potential counterparties. The solution proposed by Thurner and Poledna strikes
    directly at such uncertainty, by offering a mechanism to calculate those risks
    and make them available to everyone.

    theories of finance operate on the basis of wholly unrealistic assumptions about
    the ability of financial institutions to assess their risks rationally. Even if
    the individuals at these institutions were rational, the overwhelming complexity
    of today''s market makes it impossible to judge systemic risks because of a lack
    of information:'

- en: Since the beginning of banking the possibility of a lender to assess the riskiness
    of a potential borrower has been essential. In a rational world, the result of
    this assessment determines the terms of a lender-borrower relationship (risk-premium),
    including the possibility that no deal would be established in case the borrower
    appears to be too risky. When a potential borrower is a node in a lending-borrowing
    network, the node’s riskiness (or creditworthiness) not only depends on its financial
    conditions, but also on those who have lending-borrowing relations with that node.
    The riskiness of these neighboring nodes depends on the conditions of their neighbors,
    and so on. In this way the concept of risk loses its local character between a
    borrower and a lender, and becomes systemic.

    financial network [1]. Such an exercise can only carried out with information
    on the asset-liablilty network. This information is, up to now, not available
    to individual nodes in that network. In this sense, financial networks – the interbank
    market in particular – are opaque. This intransparency makes it impossible for
    individual banks to make rational decisions on lending terms in a financial network,
    which leads to a fundamental principle: Opacity in financial networks rules out
    the possibility of rational risk assessment, and consequently, transparency, i.e.
    access to system-wide information is a necessary condition for any systemic risk
    management.'

    lending institutions were, they couldn't possibly have made the staggeringly complex
    calculations required to assess those risks accurately. The system is too complex.
    They lacked necessary information. Hence, as Thurner and Poledna point out, we
    might help things by making this information more transparent.

    As the authors point out, much of the information that would be required to compute
    the systemic risks associated with any one bank is already reported to central
    banks, at least in developed nations. No private party has this information. No
    single investment bank has this information. Perhaps even no single central bank
    has this information. But central banks together do have it, and they could use
    it to perform a calculation of considerably value (again, in the context of the

    register’ of Central Banks, that reflects the asset-liability network of a country
    [5]. The capital structure of banks is available through standard reporting to
    Central Banks. Payment systems record financial flows with a time resolution of
    one second, see e.g. [6]. Several studies have been carried out on historical
    data of asset-liability networks [7–12], including overnight markets [13], and
    financial flows [14].

    of the asset-liability matrix in real-time, which in combination with the capital
    structure of banks, allows to define a systemic risk-rating of banks. A systemically
    risky bank in the following is a bank that – should it default – will have a substantial
    impact (losses due to failed credits) on other nodes in the network. The idea
    of network metrics is to systematically capture the fact, that by borrowing from
    a systemically risky bank, the borrower also becomes systemically more risky since
    its default might tip the lender into default. These metrics are inspired by PageRank,
    where a webpage, that is linked to a famous page, gets a share of the ‘fame’.
    A metric similar to PageRank, the so-called DebtRank, has been recently used to
    capture systemic risk levels in financial networks [15].

    you or I or any banker in the world could go to some web site and in a few seconds
    read out the DebtRank score for any bank in the developed world, and also to see
    the listing of banks ranked by the systemic risks they present. Wouldn''t that
    be wonderful? Even if central banks took no further steps, this alone would be
    a valuable project, using global information to produce a globally valuable information
    resource for everyone. (Notice also that publishing DebtRank scores isn''t the
    same as publishing all the data that banks supply to their central banks. That
    level of detail could be kept secret, with only the single measure of overall
    systemic risk being published.)'

    like it. Of course, one group would be dead set against it -- those banks who
    have the highest DebtRank scores because they are systemically the most risky.
    But their private concerns shouldn't trump the public interest in reducing such
    risks. Measuring and making such numbers public is the first step in making any
    such reduction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Thurner and Poledna do go further in making a specific proposal for using
    this information in a sensible way to reduce systemic risks. Here's how that works.
    Banks in the interbank market borrow funds for varying amounts of time from other
    banks. Typically, there's a standard interbank interest rate prevailing for all
    banks (as far as I understand). Hence, a bank looking to borrow doesn't really
    have much preference as to which bank it finds as a lender; the interest paid
    will be the same. But if the choice of lender doesn't matter to the borrowing
    bank, it does matter a lot to the rest of us, as borrowing from a systemically
    risky bank threatens the financial system. If the borrower can't pay back, that
    risky bank could be put into distress and cause trouble for the system at large.
    So, we really should have banks in the interbank market looking to borrow first
    from the least systemically risky banks, i.e. from those with low values of DebtRank.

- en: 'This is what Thurner and Poledna propose. Let central banks regulate that borrowers
    in the interbank market do just that -- seek out the least risky banks first as
    lenders. In this way, banks acting to take on lots of systemic risk would thereby
    be marked as too dangerous to make further loans. Further borrowing would instead
    be undertaken by less risky banks, thereby improving the spread of risks across
    the system. Don''t trust in the miracle of the free market to make this happen
    -- it won''t -- but step in and provide a mechanism for it to happen. As the authors
    describe it:'

- en: The idea is to reduce systemic risk in the IB network by not allowing borrowers
    to borrow from risky nodes. In this way systemically risky nodes are punished,
    and an incentive for nodes is established to be low in systemic riskiness. Note,
    that lending to a systemically dangerous node does not increase the systemic riskiness
    of the lender. We implement this scheme by making the DebtRank of all banks visible
    to those banks that want to borrow. The borrower sees the DebtRank of all its
    potential lenders, and is required (that is the regulation part) to ask the lenders
    for IB loans in the order of their inverse DebtRank. In other words, it has to
    ask the least risky bank first, then the second risky one, etc. In this way the
    most risky banks are refrained from (profitable) lending opportunities, until
    they reduce their liabilities over time, which makes them less risky. Only then
    will they find lending possibilities again. This mechanism has the effect of distributing
    risk homogeneously through the network.

    at least -- to make systemic banking collapses much less likely. Thurner and Poledna
    ran a number of agent-based simulations to test out the dynamics of such a market,
    with encouraging results. The model involves banks, firms and households and their
    interactions; details in the paper for those interested. Bottom line, as illustrated
    in the figure below, is that cascading defaults through the banking system become
    much less likely. Here the red shows the statistical likelihood over many runs
    of banking cascades of varying size (number of banks involved) when borrowing
    banks choose their counterparties at random; this is the "business as usual" situation,
    akin to the market today. In contrast, the green and blue show the same distribution
    if borrowers instead sought counterparties so as to avoid those with high values
    of DebtRank (green and blue for slightly different conditions). Clearly, system
    wide problems become much less likely.

    greater stability in finance. At face value, it makes a lot of sense and I think
    that the work I wrote about today fits into this perspective very well. The idea
    is simply that governments can provide information resources to the markets which
    would support better decisions by everyone in reckoning risks and rewards. Of
    course, we need independent people and firms gathering information in a decentralized
    way. But that isn't enough. In today's hypercomplex markets, some of the risks
    are simply invisible to anyone lacking vast quantities of data and the means to
    analyze them. Only governments currently have the requisite access to such information.
