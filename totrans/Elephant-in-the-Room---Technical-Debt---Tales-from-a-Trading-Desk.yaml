    articles on [technical](http://www.infoq.com/articles/managing-technical-debt)

    Its unfortunate, but in many corporations, technical debt is a taboo word that
    can never be discussed, and must therefore be resolved by the team behind closed
    doors, in their own time.

    microservices nor any other architecture will help. Debt piles up until default
