# Current S&P 500 Economic Model Prediction | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/09/05/current-sp-500-economic-model-prediction/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/09/05/current-sp-500-economic-model-prediction/#0001-01-01)

In responding to feedback, the [economic model](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/05/14/shiny-new-toys/) has been revised for the sake of simplicity to provide a more useable dashboard. The output is the chance of a large correction classified into three categories (low, drawdown>10%, drawdown >15%) and the predicted direction for the S&P500 over the next 90 days ( Bullish: >5% expected return, Sideways: >-5% <5% expected return, Bearish: <-5% expected return). Below is the current update. We will provide some backtests very soon, preliminary results are quite promising. [Investor IQ](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/investor-iq-2/) plans to launch a website soon to provide access to this model in real time along with current ETF and stock analytics.
