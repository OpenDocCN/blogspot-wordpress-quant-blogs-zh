    wrong, I think the paper was done well in good faith. Wrong mainly because it
    still implies people think there''s a positive Security Market Line, even though
    at best it''s flat, and wrong also because high vol assets like puts lose just
    as much money as calls (ie, the alpha is not linear in beta so much as correlated
    with volatility).  As to it being well done in spite of that, note that unlike'

    it has a concise and simple implication. Working through F&P's result, I think
    they actually made a math error; not something like a wrong sign, but rather,
    assumed an invertible matrix in one place, which is then applied to a world where
    such a matrix is non-invertible. If that doesn't make sense but sounds interesting,
    take a look at my paper, where I think I have the simplest relative utility model
    out there (eg, compared to

- en: Alas, I needed three assumptions to get the low volatility result to hold while
    still matching some other big datapoints. That is, I don't want a result that
    implies the equity risk premium is zero, or that rational investors are all shorting
    high vol stocks, because that's clearly counterfactual, and I also want to explain
    why high beta/vol assets have a negative alpha in equilibrium. Those assumptions
    are

    for these points even though they are pretty plausible and I don't think too controversial.
    Item 3 is quite controversial, so I motivate that a little by pointing to a lot
    of other data, especially non-economic data.
