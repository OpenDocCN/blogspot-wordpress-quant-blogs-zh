    it rarely spikes down, today’s action notwithstanding. In fact, today’s 29.6%
    decline in the VIX is the largest single day decline in the 17 year history of
    the VIX and in the 20 years of reconstructed VIX data.'

    instance in the last 24 years in which the VIX declined more than it did today:
    Wednesday, October 21, [1987](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987),
    two days after [Black Monday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Black%20Monday),
    when the (original calculation) VIX fell 47% from 140 to just under 74\. *[For

    VIX drops over the course of history, I sometimes like to invoke the metaphor
    of a medieval castle. A dragon periodically appears and terrorizes the castle
    and its inhabitants, sometimes visible for only a fleeting moment and other times
    hanging around for an uncomfortably long period of time. Every time the dragon
    appears, the citizens panic. One day a knight goes out into the forest and slays
    the dragon, returning with the head of the beast. The citizens rejoice and relax
    for a moment, until it occurs to them that the forest may be filled with dozens
    of dragons.

- en: Getting back to statistics, the VIX has fallen 20% in one day on eight previous
    instances. On average, looking forward one day, week, month, quarter, etc., stocks
    have tended to underperform somewhat following a sharp drop in the VIX. The last
    two instances of 20% drops, from October 2008, have now skewed the data so that
    aggregate performance looks quite dreadful. Still, one can argue that in the first
    three of the eight instances (1993, 1994 and 2006), stocks outperformed historical
    averages when looking at least two months out. All things considered, small sample
    size and all, I would have to conclude that today’s action translates to a mildly
    bearish outlook going forward – at least based on historical data.
