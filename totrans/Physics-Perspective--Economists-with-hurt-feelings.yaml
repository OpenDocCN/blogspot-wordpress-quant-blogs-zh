    and leave discussion of economics to himself and other experts in the field. It
    seems that the purpose of the new book is to correct all the confusion and explain
    to everyone why modern macro is so wonderful and right and beyond criticism. I
    don't think it is going to succeed. Anyone who reads his section on the Walrasian
    Clearinghouse -- an imaginary mechanism to explain how an economy reaches Walrasian
    equilibrium -- will pretty quickly come to the conclusion that Athreya's beloved
    picture of how an economy works is mostly mathematical fantasy.

    who reads it carefully will be able to see for themselves just how fragile and
    artificial the modern rational expectations approach to macroeconomics really
    is. I'm going to order the book because, from what I have seen, there will be
    much to learn, although possibly not about how a real economy works. Readers will
    experience a close encounter with the reality-defying attitude and arrogance of
    mainstream macroeconomics. Reading from one who holds it in such high esteem,
    the reader can also trust that he or she is not being deceived by some ignorant
    blogger who is setting up straw man arguments (a common response from wounded
    macroeconomists).

- en: As Athreya acknowledges in chapter 5, an important issue separating certain
    older macroeconomic traditions (both Keynesian and Austrian among others) is the
    idea that macroeconomic dysfunction is a manifestation of coordination failure.
    It is a property – a remarkable property – of Walrasian general equilibrium that
    it achieves perfect (i.e., Pareto-optimal) coordination of disparate, self-interested,
    competitive individual agents, fully reconciling their plans in a way that might
    have been achieved by an omniscient and benevolent central planner. Walrasian
    general equilibrium fully solves the coordination problem. Insofar as important
    results of modern macroeconomics depend on the assumption that a real-life economy
    can be realistically characterized as a Walrasian equilibrium, modern macroeconomics
    is assuming that coordination failures are irrelevant to macroeconomics. It is
    only after coordination failures have been excluded from the purview of macroeconomics
    that it became legitimate (for the sake of mathematical tractability) to deploy
    representative-agent models in macroeconomics, a coordination failure being tantamount,
    in the context of a representative agent model, to a form of irrationality on
    the part of the representative agent. Athreya characterizes choices about the
    level of aggregation as a trade-off between realism and tractability, but it seems
    to me that, rather than making a trade-off between realism and tractability, modern
    macroeconomics has simply made an a priori decision that coordination problems
    are not a relevant macroeconomic concern.

    the use of equilibrium in modern macroeconomic models. I would not deny that there
    are good reasons to adopt rational expectations and full equilibrium in some modeling
    situations, depending on the problem that theorist is trying to address. The question
    is whether it can be appropriate to deviate from the assumption of a full rational-expectations
    equilibrium for the purposes of modeling fluctuations over the course of a business
    cycle, especially a deep cyclical downturn. In particular, the idea of a Hicksian
    temporary equilibrium in which agents hold divergent expectations about future
    prices, but markets clear period by period given those divergent expectations,
    seems to offer (as in, e.g., Thompson’s “

    have about the relevant items in their own futures. It does so by asking that
    their expectations lead to economy-wide outcomes that do not contradict their
    views. By imposing the requirement that expectations not be systematically contradicted
    by outcomes, economists keep an unobservable object from becoming a source of
    “free parameters” through which we can cheaply claim to have “explained” some
    phenomenon. In other words, in rational-expectations models, expectations are
    part of what is solved for, and so they are not left to the discretion of the
    modeler to impose willy-nilly. In so doing, the assumption of rational expectations
    protects the public from economists.'

    of modern macroeconomics. I am all in favor of solving a model for equilibrium
    expectations, but solving for equilibrium expectations is certainly not the same
    as insisting that the only interesting or relevant result of a model is the one
    generated by the assumption of full equilibrium under rational expectations. (Again
    see Thompson’s “Reformulation of Macroeconomic Theory” as well as the classic

    and examine its properties in a state in which agents hold inconsistent expectations
    about future prices; the temporary equilibrium existing at a point in time does
    not correspond to a steady state. Why is such an equilibrium uninteresting and
    uninformative about what happens in a business cycle? But evidently modern macroeconomists
    such as Athreya consider it their duty to ban such models from polite discourse
    — certainly from the leading economics journals — lest the public be tainted by
    economists who might otherwise dare to abuse their models by making illicit assumptions
    about expectations formation and equilibrium concepts.
