    I’m learning JavaScript for Caplin Trader based UI implementation. I’ve been a
    Python coder since 2000, so I’ve long made the shift from C++/Java/C# style static
    type checking to dynamic type checking and a syntax that is free of type declarations.
    Which is a big shift in coding mind set. For me the big difference in JavaScript
    is [prototype based inheritance](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Inheritance).

    can debug in Visual Studio. If you favour Firefox, then [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
    is the way to go. Getting the IE/VisualStudio debugging proved too much of a struggle
    for me, so I’ve settled on Firefox 2.0.0.16 with Firebug 1.0.5, which seems to
    be working well for me.
