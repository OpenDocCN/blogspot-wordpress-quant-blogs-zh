    I ran the study back to 1987 because prior to that there was no significant bias
    on the 1st day of the month. January is interesting because over the last 23 years
    its had the worst % profitable of any month but still the 4th highest average
    returns. When New Years optimism runs high it can create a sharp up move. In fact
    there have been 3 years (1988, 2002, 2009) since 1987 where the S&P 500 has gained
    over 3% on the 1st day in January. Below is a copy of the table from the July
    1, 2009 blog post with breakdowns by month (stats not updated).
