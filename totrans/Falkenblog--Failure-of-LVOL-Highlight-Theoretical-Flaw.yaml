    factor proxy', and then choosing 100-200 stocks from the Wilshire 1000 that load
    up on this factor. As the 'volatility factor proxy' selects stocks itself, this
    approach is too convoluted, and investors rightfully don't trust black boxes,
    which given weasel word language about momentum and beta. Their LVOL

    pie chart of sector weightings, or regulatory boilerplate and irrelevant data.
    Indeed, the regulatory language clearly gets in the way of communication, highlighting
    that financial regulations are generally the opposite of helpful.

    as with LVOL). If you spent time learning advanced financial theory, you would
    learn that LVOL did it right, SPLV did it wrong, because factor loadings are the
    measure of risk, not mere characteristics like volatility. That the whole field
    has a big flaw is a theme of my new book( available in

    a subsidiary of Amazon, and their structure was clearly created by an MBA: I had
    a team with specialists who handled very narrow tasks but somehow were never the
    right person to comprehend any of my specific questions (eg, β should be different
    than b?). They all spoke as if they were reading from a script, and often I would
    find their unhelpful verbal answers on their website''s FAQs. The fact the actual
    typesetters were in India, and I could never talk to these people, I''m sure made
    sense to the top guys at Amazon, who are traditional Harvard-educated efficiency
    experts. I have a feeling monks from 12th century Ireland were more accurate and
    faster.'
