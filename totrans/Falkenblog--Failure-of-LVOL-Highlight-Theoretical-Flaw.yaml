    factor proxy', and then choosing 100-200 stocks from the Wilshire 1000 that load
    up on this factor. As the 'volatility factor proxy' selects stocks itself, this
    approach is too convoluted, and investors rightfully don't trust black boxes,

    Indeed, the regulatory language clearly gets in the way of communication, highlighting
    that financial regulations are generally the opposite of helpful.

    as with LVOL). If you spent time learning advanced financial theory, you would
    learn that LVOL did it right, SPLV did it wrong, because factor loadings are the
    measure of risk, not mere characteristics like volatility. That the whole field
    has a big flaw is a theme of my new book( available in

    a subsidiary of Amazon, and their structure was clearly created by an MBA: I had
    a team with specialists who handled very narrow tasks but somehow were never the
    right person to comprehend any of my specific questions (eg, β should be different
    than b?). They all spoke as if they were reading from a script, and often I would
    find their unhelpful verbal answers on their website''s FAQs. The fact the actual
    typesetters were in India, and I could never talk to these people, I''m sure made
    sense to the top guys at Amazon, who are traditional Harvard-educated efficiency
    experts. I have a feeling monks from 12th century Ireland were more accurate and
    faster.'

  zh: 太多的学校教育是件坏事。最近我和我的出版商（亚马逊子公司）合作，他们的结构显然是由MBA创建的：我的团队里有处理非常狭窄任务的专家，但不知何故从来没有适合理解我的任何具体问题的人（例如，β应该与b不同？）。
    他们都表现得好像在从剧本中读台词一样，并且经常我会在他们网站的常见问题解答中找到无益的口头答复。实际的排版工作是在印度完成的，我从来没能和这些人谈过，我相信这对亚马逊的高层来说是有意义的，他们传统上是哈佛教育出身的效率专家。我觉得12世纪爱尔兰的修士们更加准确和快速。
