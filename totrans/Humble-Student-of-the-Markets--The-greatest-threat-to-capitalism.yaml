    attitude in this Barrons article when bankers were asked as to whether they owed
    a social debt to society because of the bailouts (if you don’t have a Barrons
    subscription, see some excerpts here).

    Already Moody’s has picked up on this theme and warned of social unrest. The UK
    is calling the bankers’ bluff to pick up and move elsewhere, but the US has caved
    to virtually every of the bankers’ wishes. Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism has
    suggested that the proper response by the UK government would be a combination
    of harassment or punitive tax policy for the likes of Goldman or any other investment
    bank who leave.

    its manufacturing base because business schools are turning graduates oriented

- en: It's clear that financial institutions have made a mad dash to repay TARP money
    in hopes of being able to pay year-end bonuses, but what is not so clear is what
    happens after the year actually ends. Various policy makers (particularly Ben
    Bernanke, who is currently up for reappointment) have begun to take on a self-congratulatory
    tone, suggesting that the recent crisis is not only behind us, but that it has
    been resolved at a profit. What is not evident from these comments is how small
    these “profitable” inflows have actually been, in relation to what has been spent.

    disgorges the $1.5 trillion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities it has bought
    for us, and if the U.S. government does not end up having to bail those securities
    out because the cash flows from the underlying mortgages prove inadequate. Having
    no such assurance, the smug “mission accomplished” remarks of Bernanke and Geithner
    are reminiscent of a veterinarian who walks out of the operating room saying “I
    saved the life of your rabid dog … by giving it the vital organs of your children.”
