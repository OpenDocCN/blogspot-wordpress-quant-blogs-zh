# VIX and More: The VIX and Bollinger Bands

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/vix-and-bollinger-bands.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/vix-and-bollinger-bands.html#0001-01-01)

I’m not sure how I managed to fritter away five months on this blog and spend [so little time](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/absolute-vs-relative-highs-and-lows-in.html) talking about Bollinger Bands (BBs) and the VIX, but today seems like as good a time as any to dive right in.

First, for anyone who needs a brief refresher on what Bollinger Bands are or how they are calculated, I refer you to the StockCharts.com [overview](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands); for some thoughts on how to apply BBs to trading, OnlineTradingConcepts.com has a [good summary](http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com/TechnicalAnalysis/BollingerBands.html).  The best detailed source of information on Bollinger Bands comes, not surprisingly, from John Bollinger’s own site, [BollingerBands.com](http://www.bollingerbands.com/).  Unfortunately, John does not provide a lot of his thoughts on BBs for free, but you can get a good idea of his thinking from a 2001 list of his [15 basic rules](http://www.bollingerbands.com/services/bb/?page=8).

I have included a six month chart of the VIX below, with the default (20,2,0) BB settings in addition to a [BB width](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_band_width) indicator and an overlay of the SPX.  For today, I am only going to offer a handful of observations (based on this chart and some research going back past the six month cutoff):

*   When the VIX tags its Bollinger Bands, it is usually a good time to think about a VIX mean reversion play
*   When the VIX tags its Bollinger Bands, it often signals a short-term change in the SPX trend
*   VIX closes outside of the Bollinger Bands (which we are on target for today) are almost always associated with dramatic market moves and/or changes in the trend
*   When the VIX BB width drops below 1.8, it frequently signals that consolidation is ending and a sharp move is just around the corner
*   Looking back to late-March, a VIX close above 15 would definitely be significant in terms of support and resistance (we are currently trading at 14.76)
