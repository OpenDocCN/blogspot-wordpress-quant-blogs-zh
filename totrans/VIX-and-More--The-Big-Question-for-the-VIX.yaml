    this blog gets, there is a fair amount of interest (about five times as much as
    there was a year ago) in the nanosubject known as the VIX.

    regular reading, wonders if the VIX phenomenon has [jumped the shark](http://www.jumptheshark.com/index.jspa).  Drawing
    upon the latest from Steven Sears, [Don’t Read too Much Into a Rising VIX](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB121123314077605071.html?mod=rss_barrons_the_striking_price_daily),
    my avian friends opine (in [Has the VIX Jumped the Shark](http://www.condoroptions.com/2008/05/21/has-the-vix-jumped-the-shark/))
    that “the VIX has definitely received too much attention of late, and is being
    asked to perform too many roles - market timer, sentiment indicator, and even
    trading vehicle.”'

    doesn’t feature at least a casual nod to VIX action, and more importantly, those

    picked up on the VIX theme and added:'

    estimate, and as such, there is a boatful of noise in the number any time you
    look at it. At the end of the day, it tends to confirm something you already knew.
    Back in January and March the VIX spiked as the market got plowed and peaked on
    those big down gap days. Guess what, emotions got extreme.”*'

    [offered some good advice](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2008/05/vix-jumping-shark.html)
    to VIX watchers.  “Going forward, we should forget about the blips, myself included…[a]nd
    we should concentrate on looking for divergences.”

- en: Condor Options and Adam certainly make some excellent points.  Regarding the
    larger question of whether or not the VIX has jumped the shark, my answer is that
    when I started a blog about the VIX with a tongue-in-cheek tagline of “Your One
    Stop VIX-Centric View of the Universe…” some seventeen months ago, the water skis
    were already passing over the dorsal fin.

    specific points about the VIX, I will save these subjects for more detailed treatment
    at a later date.
