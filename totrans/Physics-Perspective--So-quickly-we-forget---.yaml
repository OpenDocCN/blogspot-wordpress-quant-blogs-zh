    need to look seriously at systemic risks -- risks not tied to the well-being of
    just any one institution, but which emerge out of their interconnections and interdependence.
    Systemic risk is the new buzz phrase for research on banking network stability.
    The Dodd-Frank financial reforms still under negotiation aim to improve systemic
    stability (in some small way, at least), in part by raising capital requirements
    on individual banks.

    a banking network depends on more than the situation facing each individual bank
    -- the density of links between banks matters too. More links of financial dependence
    between banks can share risks and make a network more stable, in some cases, but
    they can also make the system more fragile. So raising capital requirements isn't
    enough. Still, it's at least a step in the right direction.

    fat-tail-associated crises is that years of apparent profitability can be wiped
    out in a few tumultuous weeks. Two years ago financial writers couldn't repeat
    often enough what they'd learned from Nassim Taleb's

    sense. That money set aside as ballast might just enable the bank to survive tough
    times in the future, and might also make the entire banking network itself more
    stable, as well as the broader economy. The kind of "profitability" this paragraph
    is talking about isn't what we need.

    that there's an interesting trade-off we don't understand very well between the
    increasing safety that comes from diversification as the network grows more dense,
    and the simultaneously increasing danger of cascading distress which dense ties
    make more likely. As Thoma puts it,

    to institution, there are two possible scenarios. First, think of a drop of poison
    in the ocean. The ocean is so big that even a powerful poison can be neutralized
    as it spreads.... This is much like traditional financial risk sharing where large
    individual losses are spread throughout the system so that the losses to any one
    person are tiny.

    does not become less toxic, it continues to be lethal to anyone who comes in contact
    with it. In this case, you want to break the network connections -- i.e. compartmentalize
    -- as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the lethal infection. You may
    even want to have the compartments set in advance if you cannot sever the ties
    fast enough.
