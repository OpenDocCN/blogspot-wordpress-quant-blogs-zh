- en: Nearing the halfway point in today’s trading session, the S&P 500 index has
    made an intraday low of 1036.38, which is below the recent September 25^(th) low
    of 1041.17 and about 4.1% below the September 23^(rd) high of 1080.15.

- en: This 4.1% pullback is the seventh significant pullback since the current bull
    market began back in March. The table below summarizes all the pullbacks of 3.9%
    or more from the intraday highs to the intraday lows. The current pullback, highlighted
    in yellow, represents the second longest in terms of duration from the high to
    the low. As far as the magnitude of the pullback, however, 4.1% ranks sixth out
    of seven. The average (mean) pullback prior to the current one has been 5.84%.
    Applying an average pullback to the 1080.15 high would imply a pullback to about
    SPX 1017.

- en: Some other technical factors have me looking for support in the 1020-1025 area.
    Should that support fail to materialize, I would not be surprised to see SPX 1017
    taken out quickly and the SPX test 1000 in short order.

- en: All things being equal, however, there is no reason to assume that the recent
    history of short and relatively shallow pullbacks should not continue into the
    future, with SPX 1100 a more likely next stop than SPX 1000.
