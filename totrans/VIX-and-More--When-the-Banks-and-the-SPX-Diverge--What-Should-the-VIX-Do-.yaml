- en: I raise this issue because for most of today’s session, the S&P 500 index was
    flattish, while the VIX was down several percentage points. At the same time the
    financials in general and the banks in particular were struggling mightily. As
    the chart below shows [BKX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BKX),
    the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods banking index, which spent the bulk of the day down
    6-8%.

- en: Does the fact that the VIX fell 5.4% while the banks sold off (-5.6%) and the
    SPX rose (1.6%) mean that traders of SPX options are not concerned about the future
    of the banks? I find this hard to believe. I would love to hear some comments
    on this one?
