    signs that it may be time to get on the commodity bull for a ride. Both sentiment

    suggesting accumulation. This chart from Mary Ann Bartels of BoA/Merrill Lynch
    (Note: the depictions of bull and bear phases are mine, not hers) shows that large
    speculators, who are mainly hedge funds, have moved off a crowded long in commodity
    prices. The chart was produced by aggregating the Commitment of Data reports for
    all futures exchange traded commodities in the CRB Index.'

- en: My depiction of the bull and bear phases show that during the bear phases, neutral
    readings are good times to fade the rally. On the other hand, neutral readings
    are good opportunity to accumulate positions during the bull phases. The bull
    and bear phases is best exemplified by the chart of the bellwether of gold prices,
    which bottomed in 2002 along with the rest of the commodity complex.

    positions doesn't mean that there isn't more downside to commodity prices. To
    see some near-term upside, you need a catalyst.

    Our outlook assumes most commodity prices will increase slightly in 2012 and continue
    at levels that encourage investment. We expect that copper will average over $4
    per pound, Central Appalachian coal about $75 per ton and West Texas Intermediate
    crude oil about $100 per barrel.

    building construction. We are expecting housing starts of at least 700 thousand

    to trigger a worldwide recession. The Eurozone will likely have at least two quarters
    of weak, possibly negative growth, but should begin to improve in the second half
    of 2012\. For 2012, our outlook assumes economic growth for the Eurozone near
    zero and growth of about half of a percentage point for Europe in total.
