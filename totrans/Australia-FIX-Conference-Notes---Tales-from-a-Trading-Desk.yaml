    in their applications/demo’s.  I realise numerous vendors sell non-UI technology,
    but the demo’s really could do with some work to allow potential customers to

    lane – speed bumps to level the latency game.  EBS Live market data costs are
    about $50k per month which sends updates on incoming orders and prices every 100
    milliseconds.  33 milliseconds for data to travel between London and New York,
    thus a speed bump of anything over 30 milliseconds opens up arbitrage opportunities
    from a geographic location perspective.
