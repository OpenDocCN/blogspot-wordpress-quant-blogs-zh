    close on 1/24/07.  Many seem to be convinced that the markets have entered into
    an [extended period of low volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/challenge-to-two-things-you-think-you.html)
    where a single digit VIX reading is no longer necessarily an automatic signal
    to buy some VIX calls.  The grumbling is along the lines of “it’s different this
    time,” but the real concern is that things are going to be different in the volatility
    world for a long time to come.  Not only will the old rules not apply, but it
    may be awhile before the new rules are apparent.

    and [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8652989)
    have weighed in with warnings about the calm before the storm.  Not surprisingly,
    these publications are not alone.  Felix Zalauf has [predicted](http://online.barrons.com/public/article/SB116925725279982304.html?)
    that the VIX will be back over 20 this year.  My decaying VIX calls notwithstanding,
    I am still looking for a significant bump in the road sometime during the next
    two options cycles.  If I turn out to be wrong, it will be no consolation to have
    learned company on my side; in the markets, one always does.

- en: It is probably important to repeat some [earlier caveats](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/history-of-sub-10-vix-closes.html)
    to the effect that building a trading strategy around 9 data points in 17 years
    is probably not a great use of one’s time.  I should also reiterate that of those
    9 instances, 4 fall on consecutive trading days in 1993 and another 2 are from
    consecutive trading days in 2006, so it is easy to argue that the history of sub-10
    VIX closes includes a mere 5 data points.  Recognizing this, if you study at the
    chart above, you can see that almost half of the lines are the same data, with
    the time phase shifted one or more days.

    bounce among the group yet, currently sitting below the previous weakest bounce,
    which just happens to be the last sub-10 close in December 2006.  Two data points
    don’t necessarily make a trend, but they do provide some food for thought.  Note
    that in all instances of a sub-10 close to date, most of the bounce over the next
    20 trading days had already been completed in five trading days.
