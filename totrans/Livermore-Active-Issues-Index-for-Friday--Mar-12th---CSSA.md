David – if I understand correctly, the hedged Livermore index historical results back to 1999, include an equal weighting in an inverse QQQ, no splippage, commissions or margin interest assumptions. I will be executing the strategy in a tax sheltered account w/o the option of margin. With a 50-50 allocation between Livermore and an inverse etf, would I simply divide your posted returns by two? Thanks, Kevin
