    Tonight I decided to just cut and paste an excerpt from the Subscriber Letter...

    edges. Not the case so far this week. I’m having a hard time uncovering anything
    terribly compelling.'

- en: When considering indicators, those that measure fear or capitulation are simply
    not registering the kind of extremes seen around market bottoms. The VIX has moved
    higher but it hasn’t spiked in a substantial way. The VIX:VXV ratio just poked
    above 1 for the first time in a while on Tuesday. Ratios of 1.1 or higher have
    more often been seen near bottoms. New lows have risen but are not even close
    to the levels seen in July. The CBI is at a paltry 3\. The McClellan Oscillator
    is not near overdone. The percent of stocks trading above their 40-day moving
    average is over 40%. Near the July bottom it dipped below 10%.

    expect the breadth, fear, and capitulation indicators to be less extreme than
    in July. Still, without evidence of a washout in progress, I have little inclination
    to step in front of this market and start buying.

    what I’m seeing is nearly unprecedented. I looked for other times the S&P made
    2% in one day and then saw those gains completely wiped out the next. It’s only
    happened twice before: 3/24/03 and 6/6/08\. If I loosen the requirement to a 1.5%
    rise, then there are 16 occurrences. Unfortunately, trading after these instances
    was mixed and choppy with little discernable edge. I also looked at performance
    following drops of 3% or more in the S&P. Again, mixed results.'

- en: The NDX action continues to be notable. Today marked the 6th day in a row the
    Nasdaq 100 has closed below its lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, there is
    little precedent here as well. There have only been 3 occurrences since its inception
    in 1986\. They were 12/18/89, 3/31/94, and 5/18/06\. Certainly it’s overdue for
    a bounce but I’m not terribly excited about buying into it at this point.*
