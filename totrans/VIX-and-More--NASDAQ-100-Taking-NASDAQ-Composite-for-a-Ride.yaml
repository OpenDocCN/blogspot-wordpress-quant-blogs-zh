    of a handful of generals and market breadth analysis, I thought I should highlight
    a comment from yesterday by [Ben Bittlrolff](http://benbittrolff.blogspot.com/)
    who points to a recent observation by [Mike Shedlock](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2007/10/bad-breadth-and-smelly-sox.html)
    that half of the gains in the NASDAQ so far this year are from only three stocks:  [AAPL](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=aapl&hl=en),
    [RIMM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rimm&hl=en), and [GOOG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog&hl=en).'

    ratio of the [NASDAQ-100 (NDX)](http://www.nasdaq.com/services/indexes/ViewIndexes/Nasdaq_100.aspx?symbol=IXNDX)
    to the [NASDAQ Composite](http://www.nasdaq.com/services/indexes/ViewIndexes/Nasdaq_composite.aspx?symbol=IXIC).  For
    visual simplicity, I have eliminated the weekly values and included only the four
    week and 39 week simple moving averages.  The storyline is fairly straightforward:
    ever since the February 27^(th) selloff, the NASDAQ-100 [listing of the [components
    of the NASDAQ-100](http://dynamic.nasdaq.com/dynamic/nasdaq100_activity.stm)]
    has been pulling the broader composite along for the ride.  Scroll back to Mike
    Shedlock’s comments about the big three horses and it appears that these three
    en fuego large caps have been pulling both the NASDAQ-100 and the 3000+ stock
    composite index.'

    horses are about to appear to help pull the sled or AAPL, RIMM and GOOG are going
    to run out of energy trying to get up one of these upcoming hills.  Be sure to
    watch the ratio of the NASDAQ-100 to the NASDAQ composite for some clues on how
    this story is developing.'
