**Mid-week market update**: About a month ago, I warned that the market was undergoing a regime shift from growth to value (see [What would Bob Farrell say?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/01/23/what-would-bob-farrell-say/)) and compared today's Big Tech momentum stocks, not to the dot-com mania, but the Nifty Fifty era. On the weekend, I rhetorically asked in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/HumbleStudent/status/1363156520670793731) that if Bloomberg TV has to explain r/WSB lingo to its audience, it's probably a sign that speculative momentum was nearing the end of its run.

Here is what that means for the stock market.
