# Humble Student of the Markets: A pause in the reflation trade?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/04/a-pause-in-reflation-trade.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/04/a-pause-in-reflation-trade.html#0001-01-01)

Recently, a growing narrative in the market is arguing for a pause in the reflation trade for the following reasons:

*   Both the cyclically sensitive copper/gold and base metal/gold ratios have moved sideways.
*   The 10-year Treasury yield peaked out in March and it is now falling, which is an indication of the bond market's belief of a retreat in growth expectations.
*   The Chinese stock market has tanked relative to global stocks, as measured by MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI).

If these market signals are indeed pointing to a pause in growth expectations, then investors should be prepared for either a risk-off tone in the markets or some choppiness and consolidation in the months ahead.
