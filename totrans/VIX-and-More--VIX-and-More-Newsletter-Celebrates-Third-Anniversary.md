# VIX and More: VIX and More Newsletter Celebrates Third Anniversary

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/vix-and-more-newsletter-celebrates.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/vix-and-more-newsletter-celebrates.html#0001-01-01)

Today’s publication of the *[VIX and More Newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)* marks the third anniversary of the launch of this newsletter, which was launched on the heels of the demise of Bear Stearns amidst increasing concerns about the stability of the financial system and increasing market volatility.

Three years later the newsletter has definitely found its voice and represents a more detailed discussion of geopolitical and macroeconomic events than can be found here as well as some broader perspective on the full range of asset classes and issues related to volatility.

Rather than clutter up this blog, I have an entire blog dedicated to the newsletter, as well as the model portfolios and [Stock of the Week ‘Sequential Portfolio’](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week) (yes it really is up 1918% in its first 2 3/4 years) information I discuss in the newsletter each week: [VIX and More Subscriber Newsletter Blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).
