    it truly captures something big, the essence of the idea is as simple as what
    he presented. The particulars of his academic papers, with their theorems and
    lemmas are ephemeral, the nature of current rhetoric, because defining a measure
    space, and outlining that this result only holds when U'(0)=inf and U''<0, is
    just not essential to his insight.

    policy implication is, there might be situations where one wants to invoke the

    the political issues involved, in that such arguments are often used as pretexts
    for politicians to distribute monopoly power like patronage jobs. Ann Krueger
    wrote a very interesting piece in the AEA about this, and noted that while there
    were some good reasons for adopting tariffs and trade barriers, in practice, it
    was counterproductive because it merely encouraged wasteful rent-seeking, and
    the effect of sheltering an industry from competition leads not to a high-flying
    industrial sector, but a bloated one. Further, infant industries never appear
    to grow up, so that some industries like textiles and sugar are seemingly stuck
    in infancy for generations.'

    1990's on why infant industry arguments may work (increasing returns to scale),
    but then found he was often being used by simple Luddites to increase trade barriers,

    one Big Idea, is merely one argument for trade protection. Further, it does not
    address why increasing returns to scale exist. In this sense, his result is a
    bit like Solow's famous result that productivity growth (the Solow residual),
    and not capital and labor growth, are the keys to productivity growth. Kind of
    interesting, but unless you can explain why certain countries have higher productivity
    growth, not so much. Thus, when a Nobel Prize Winning economists discusses his
    subject, in the realm of policy he is really a neophyte, because the debate involves
    many issues, not just one, and often his insight is very parochial even within
    his field of expertise.
