    as I’ll be at the game. (I’m the guy in the upper deck with the green shirt and
    black and green hat in case you see me on TV.) Instead, I’ve decided to prepare
    a little write-up on options trading.

    trading timeframe. Most of this focuses on large-cap stocks and highly liquid
    ETF’s. With these positions, instead of trading the stocks or etf’s, I will many
    times trade the options. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Risk control
    and 2) Leverage.'

    me I may be tying up the capital for longer than I would like and 2) If disaster
    strikes (think Bear Stearns – and no I didn’t trade it) my position could get
    wiped out. Who knows where the next 90% drop is lurking?

    deep in the money calls, the outlay is significantly less that purchasing the
    stock. Second, they provide a “natural stop” for the trade (they’ll only drop
    to zero). I’ll use a recent Subscriber Letter trade as an example. Bank of America
    (BAC) was scaled into last week and the exit trigger occurred this morning. For
    my own accounts, I did not purchase any BAC. Instead I bought the June 25 calls.
    They cost me about 15% of what I would have spent to buy the stock. So if I wanted
    exposure to $100,000 worth of BAC, I instead would buy about $15,000 worth of
    BACFE. It's fairly deep and trades with little premium and a delta of nearly 1\.
    If it goes up, I make nearly the same dollar for dollar. If it goes down, I can't
    lose more than $15,000 (unless I roll to another option). To put it another way,
    if you can get a deep call like this for 15% of the price of the stock, then you
    can effectively get a 10% position with an account risk of 1.5% (option goes to
    zero). Also, depending on how the drop occurs, premium may get built into the
    option, so I may not lose as much as I would have on the stock purchase.

    simply buying the stock. I don’t normally do it for leverage. I do it to control
    risk.

- en: Index trades are a different story. Here I will many times look for leverage.
    The execution is generally the same, though. The S&P 500 is the index I trade
    the most and I normally do it with SPY options. As I look at my screen while I’m
    typing this the SPY is trading at $135.73 and the June 129 calls expiring in 3
    days (SPYFY) are at $6.80\. Only about $0.07 premium. The 129 calls with 12 days
    (RQQFY) left have about $0.15 premium in them. Either way the premium is quite
    small. If I want to get leveraged I can lay out about 15% of my capital and have
    300% exposure to SPY. ($6.80 * 3 = $20.4 / $135.73 = 15%).

    control risk and/or gain leverage. If you’re not familiar with trading options
    then it’s just enough to make you dangerous. I’ll try and follow-up in the next
    few days with some guidelines I use when considering these kind of deep options
    plays.
