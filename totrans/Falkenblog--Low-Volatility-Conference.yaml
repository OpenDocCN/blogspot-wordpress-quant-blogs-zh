    premium within equities. This implies that you can generate a dominant Sharpe
    ratio by simply focusing on only those stocks with low volatility. Reduce volatility
    by 33% relative to the indices (very doable), and you increase your Sharpe 50%!

    removing them raises the portfolio return.

- en: My talk focused on the idea that risk and return are not correlated in practice.
    This was a theme of my book Finding Alpha, and so I went over my empirical proof,
    which is to present the large scope of data that contradict a positive risk-return
    relationship, about 20 different asset classes. If risk and return are empirically
    uncorrelated, low volatility investing is a rather straightforward normative implication
    of what a rational investor should do, so clearly my invite served to help their
    argument and I was only too happy to shill for the truth.

    really believe in the value of index funds relative to active managers. A key
    was, John Bogle , the CEO, really believed it, having written a senior thesis
    at Princeton on the subject decades earlier. Robeco has several researchers who
    all believe in the dominance of low volatility investing, and being right on a
    basic principle like this makes it a lot easier to be tactically proficient. I
    hope they can keep the imitators at bay, because I've sent innumerable letters
    and made presentations to funds that have all been veriy dismissive of this volatility
    finding. Thus, I would prefer they pay for their late-coming to he facts, because
    their crowd has been singularly unhelpful to those of us trying to sell the world,
    in academia or in the private sector, on this idea.

    than the indices, index investing does not offer wildly better performance than
    active investing, but it is clearly better. The case for low volatility portfolios
    is even more compelling in a Sharpe ratio sense, because there you increase returns
    by 1-4%, and lower volatility by 30%. One fund manager at the seminar discussed
    how they were now allocating 30% of their portfolio to low volatility investing.
    I suspect more and more institutions will find this a good idea, and it’s going
    to be a big trend.
