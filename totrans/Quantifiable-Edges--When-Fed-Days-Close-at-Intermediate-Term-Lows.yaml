- en: In last night’s letter I examined 20-day lows that occur on Fed Days during
    long-term uptrends. The results appeared interesting. You'll find the stats table

- en: Over the first 1-4 day period there doesn't appear to be much of an edge. But
    over the 5-10 day period the market has reliably risen. Instances are low, but
    I still thought the two-week results were strong enough to keep in mind and give
    some consideration.
