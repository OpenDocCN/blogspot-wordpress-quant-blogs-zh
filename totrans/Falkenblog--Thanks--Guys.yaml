- en: A war is like a bar fight in that 100% of them involve at least one real jerk
    and most are avoidable, yet sometimes you need to fight. I know that your average
    19 year old doesn't really choose who he fights for, and so its not like American
    19 year olds were more enlightened than the Germans or Soviets of WW2, but their
    actions are sometimes necessary, and always take courage and sacrifice. Hopefully
    this century will have fewer wars than last, but it all has to be put into context
    as there is a lot of suffering and death caused not by organized conflict, so
    unfortunately pacifism is not always the answer. So, here's a salute to the poor
    guys who gave up their life for others, such as the 50 million South Koreans who
    live a relatively nice life relative to the alternative.
