- en: After watching the bond market rally for the last few months, one has to wonder
    whether a) today’s statement by the Fed to effectively lower the 10-year yield
    through re-investment from their mortgage-backed securities was already priced
    in the market or b) the market realizes that the Fed is running out of ammunition
    and that lower rates is no longer creating demand in the housing market or for
    consumers. In all likelihood, it is probably a combination of both factors—and
    a classic example of why it is important to always ask why a particular market
    seems to be doing well against the conventional logic. The bond market is comprised
    of investors that focus almost exclusively on the economy and fed policy, unlike
    the stock market that often represents a compendium of opinions about individual
    stocks. As a consequence the bond market is far more likely to correctly discount
    future events- especially since large players like the Fed are involved that actually
    make the big decisions that impact the economy. The trend in yields reveals the
    economic/inflationary expectations and inside information held by these market
    players . Most of the time, history has show that they are right.

  zh: 观察了过去几个月债券市场的上涨，人们不禁要思考以下问题：a）美联储今天通过从他们的抵押贷款支持证券中进行再投资来有效降低10年期收益率的声明是否已经在市场中定价，或者b）市场是否意识到美联储已经耗尽了弹药，降息不再刺激住房市场或消费者需求。很可能两者兼而有之——这是一个经典的例子，说明了为什么总是要问为什么一个特定的市场看起来好像违背了常规逻辑。债券市场主要由专注于经济和美联储政策的投资者组成，与股票市场不同，后者通常代表对个别股票的意见集合。因此，债券市场更有可能正确地贴现未来事件——尤其是由于像美联储这样的大型参与者参与其中，他们实际上是影响经济的重要决策者。收益率的趋势反映了这些市场参与者持有的经济/通胀预期和内部信息。大多数情况下，历史表明他们是正确的。
- en: 'Today if one observed the reaction to the Fed statement they would see that:
    1) commodities fell  on the day 2) stocks fell 3) bonds rose -with the 10-year
    yield bonds leading the way. This seems to support a deflationary thesis–if the
    market felt that supporting the 10-year bond would be stimulative since it is
    akin to lowering interest rates, then it would have rallied instead of falling.
     In fact, in recent times, the market has actually done better when short-term
    yields (the 13-week yield) are ***rising*** instead of falling. To me this suggests
    that the market is more afraid of deflation than inflation. It also suggests that
    rising short-term yields indicate that the easy money is in fact working its way
    into the economy, and therefore boosting spending,  corporate earnings, and in
    turn the S&P500\. Looking at the action in the 10-year treasury via the TLH exchange-traded
    fund versus the TIP (inflation-protected bonds) ETF with roughly the same duration
    we see substantial relative strength favoring the 10-year treasury. Momentum favoring
    the 10-year over inflation-protected bonds started building in May–which neatly
    coincided with the market correction. Further supporting the deflationary fears
    is the fact that commodities (excepting gold and wheat) have been acting very
    weak for some time–which went against the conventional thinking that the current
    Fed policy would lead to runaway inflation. The futures show contango virtually
    across the board–which indicates that either demand is weak or that market players
    believe that future spot prices should trend lower. (no rational market participant
    would pay more for prices today than in the future unless there was a shortage–which
    is backwardation. in contrast, contango–or higher future prices than spot–is normal
    given the cost of inventory carry and interest rates).'

  zh: 今天，如果有人观察到对美联储声明的反应，他们会发现：1）大宗商品当天下跌，2）股票下跌，3）债券上涨——其中10年期债券收益率领先。这似乎支持通缩论点——如果市场认为支持10年期债券将是刺激性的，因为这相当于降低利率，那么市场就会上涨而不是下跌。事实上，近来市场实际上在短期收益率（13周收益率）上升而不是下降时表现更好。对我来说，这表明市场更害怕通缩而不是通胀。这也表明，上升的短期收益率表明宽松的货币政策实际上正在进入经济，并因此提高了支出、企业收益，进而提高了标普500指数。通过TLH交易所交易的10年期国债与具有大致相同期限的TIP（通胀保护债券）ETF相比，我们看到10年期国债具有相对强劲的相对强度。从5月开始，10年期国债相对通货膨胀保护债券的动能开始增强，这与市场调整正好重合。进一步支持通缩恐惧的是，除了黄金和小麦之外的大宗商品已经有一段时间表现非常疲弱——这与当前美联储政策将导致恶性通货膨胀的传统思维相矛盾。期货市场几乎全面显示递增——这表明要么需求疲弱，要么市场参与者相信未来现货价格应该趋于下降。（除非存在短缺，否则没有理性的市场参与者会比未来价格更高地支付今天的价格——这就是反向操作。相比之下，递增——或者未来价格高于现货——在库存运营成本和利率的情况下是正常的）。
- en: All of this said, I do believe that the bond market is due for a mild correction
    of sorts. It seems a little too easy to bet on the 10-year in the short-term after
    the Fed just tipped their intentions so openly, and the fact that the market is
    already so overbought going into the meeting. From my limited experiences watching/analyzing
    such events it seems that the big players talk their book up the most right before
    short-term market tops. I still think that the thesis that deflation is coming
    and that bonds are in an implausible bull market is something worth taking seriously
    for the time being.

  zh: 尽管如此，我确实认为债券市场在某种程度上是需要一些轻微调整的。在美联储如此公开地透露他们的意图之后，短期内押注于10年期似乎太容易了，而且市场在会议之前已经过度买入。从我有限的观察/分析此类事件的经验来看，似乎大玩家在短期市场顶部之前最大程度地宣传自己的交易策略。我仍然认为通缩即将来临并且债券处于不太可信的牛市的论点是值得暂时认真对待的。
