- en: Helios is an [operating system](http://www.osnews.com/story/22251/Another_Microsoft_Research_Operating_System_Helios)
    designed to simplify the task of writing, deploying, and tuning applications for
    heterogeneous platforms. Helios introduces satellite kernels, which export a single,
    uniform set of OS abstractions across CPUs of disparate architectures and performance
    characteristics. Access to I/O services such as file systems are made transparent
    via remote message passing, which extends a standard microkernel message-passing
    abstraction to a satellite kernel infrastructure. Helios retargets applications
    to available ISAs by compiling from an intermediate language.
