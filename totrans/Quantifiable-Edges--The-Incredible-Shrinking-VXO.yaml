- en: 'The VXO has dropped very strongly over the last week and a half. On Thursday
    for the 2nd day in a row it closed more than 20% below its 10ma. Looking back
    to 1986 I was only able to find 3 other instances where this occurred. While it’s
    dangerous to draw solid conclusions from just 3 instances I decided to show them
    below:'

- en: It hasn’t happened in about 21 years, which makes the setup even more questionable,
    but the run-up / drawdown stats were so lopsided I thought it was worth pointing
    out. Over the next 2 days the instances all saw a drawdown between 2.1% - 3.8%.
    Only 1 instance saw any run-up, and it was just 1.6%. (We’ll be testing that at
    the open.)
