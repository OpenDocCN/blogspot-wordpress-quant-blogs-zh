    likely to make a big move in one direction or the other rather than just drift
    sideways from current levels.

    markets are at one of those crossroads that precedes a big move.  The problem,
    of course, is getting the direction right.

- en: The most popular way to play a large anticipated move of undetermined direction
    is with a long [straddle](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/straddle.aspx)
    or a long [strangle](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/strangle.aspx).  If
    you get a big move – and particularly if you get is shortly after initiating the
    position – you will likely be able to lock in a substantial profit.  Losses are
    limited to the cost of opening the position, but if volatility is widely expected,
    the position can be expensive to open and time decay can be painful.

    and [put backspreads](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/putbackspread.aspx).  There
    a couple of important distinctions between a straddle/strangle approach and a
    backspread approach.  First of all, straddles and strangles can entail a significant
    initial outlay.  With backspreads, on the other hand, you can essentially finance
    the excess out of the money calls or puts by selling some at the money or slightly
    out of the money options and end up with a net credit or zero cost transaction.  Second,
    if the options sold are at the money or out of the money, you will make money
    if the underlying does not move.  Finally, as the graphic below (of a call backspread)
    demonstrates, the big windfall with a back spread is unidirectional.  So unlike
    the straddle or strangle, large profits only accrue when you can call the direction
    of the move.'
