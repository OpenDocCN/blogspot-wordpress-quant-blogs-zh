    increasing again. According to usual thinking in economics and finance, this growth
    of the market should be a good thing. If people are entering into these contacts,

    和Joseph Stiglitz撰写。文章首先指出，在2008年危机之后，衍生品的未清余额短暂下降，但现在又开始增加。从经济学和金融学的通常思维来看，市场的这种增长应该是一件好事。如果人们正在进入这些合同，那一定是有原因的，即对冲风险或利用机会，这些交易应该会导致有益的经济交流。但Battiston和同事们指出，这实际上可能并不正确：
- en: By engaging in a speculative derivatives market, players can potentially amplify
    their gains, which is arguably the most plausible explanation for the proliferation
    of derivatives in recent years. Needless to say, losses are also amplified. Unlike
    bets on, say, dice — where the chances of the outcome are not affected by the
    bet itself — the more market players bet on the default of a country, the more
    likely the default becomes. Eventually the game becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,
    as in a bank run, where if each party believes that others will withdraw their
    money from the bank, it pays each to do so. More perversely, in some cases parties
    have incentives (and opportunities) to precipitate these events, by spreading
    rumours or by manipulating the prices on which the derivatives are contingent
    — a situation seen most recently in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
    affair.

- en: It now seems that the proliferation of financial instruments induces strong
    fluctuations and instabilities for similar reasons. The basis for pricing complex
    derivatives makes several conventional assumptions that amount to the notion that
    trading activity does not feed back on the dynamical behaviour of markets. This
    idealized (and unrealistic) model can have the effect of masking potential instabilities
    in markets. A more detailed picture, taking into account the effects of individual
    trades on prices, reveals the onset of singularities as the number of financial

    through regulations, to try to manage the complexity of the financial network
    and encourage its stability. Stability isn't something we should expect to occur

    of the derivatives industry, but the topic may be of extreme importance in future
    efforts to devise effective financial regulations. The key insight coming from
    network science is that the architecture of a network -- its topology -- has a
    huge impact on how influences (such as financial distress) spread through the
    network. Hence, global network topology is intimately linked up with system stability;
    knowledge of global structure is absolutely essential to managing systemic risk.
    Unfortunately, the history of law and finance is such that much of the information
    that would be required to understand the real web of links between financial institutions
    remains private, hidden, unknown to the public or to regulators.

    norms and accepted practices, all of these represent some kind of "control" placed

- en: Of course, "control" has a long history in engineering science where it is the
    focus of an extensive and quite successful "control theory." This paper reviews
    some recent work which has extended control theory to complex networks. One of
    the key questions is if the dynamics of large complex networks might be controlled,
    or at least strongly steered, by influencing only a small subset of the elements
    making up the network, and perhaps not even those that seem to be the most significant.
    This is, I think, clearly a promising area for further work. Let's take the insight
    of a century and more of control theory and ask if we can't use that to help prevent,
    or give early warnings of, the kinds of disasters that have hit finance in the
    past decade.
