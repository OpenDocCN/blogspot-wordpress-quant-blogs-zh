    the outcome of collaborations between physicists and a number of prominent economists
    (Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz among them) and several regulators from important
    central banks. The value of insight coming out of physics-inspired research into
    the collective dynamics of financial markets is really starting to be recognized
    by people who matter (even if most academic economists won't wake up to this probably
    for several decades).

    gain wide attention soon. It essentially demonstrates that the theorists'' ideal
    of complete, arbitrage free markets in equilibrium isn''t a nirvana of market
    efficiency, as is generally assumed. Examination of the dynamics of such a market,
    even within the neo-classical framework, shows that any approach to this efficient
    ideal also brings growing instability and likely market collapse. The ideal of
    complete markets, in other words, isn''t something we should be aiming for.'

    Georg, Robert May and Joseph Stiglitz. It begins by noting that the volume of
    derivatives outstanding fell briefly following the crisis of 2008, but is now
    increasing again. According to usual thinking in economics and finance, this growth
    of the market should be a good thing. If people are entering into these contacts,
    it must be for a reason, i.e. to hedge their risks or to exploit opportunities,
    and these deals should lead to beneficial economic exchange. But, as Battiston
    and colleagues note, this may not actually be true:'

    their gains, which is arguably the most plausible explanation for the proliferation
    of derivatives in recent years. Needless to say, losses are also amplified. Unlike
    bets on, say, dice — where the chances of the outcome are not affected by the
    bet itself — the more market players bet on the default of a country, the more
    likely the default becomes. Eventually the game becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,
    as in a bank run, where if each party believes that others will withdraw their
    money from the bank, it pays each to do so. More perversely, in some cases parties
    have incentives (and opportunities) to precipitate these events, by spreading
    rumours or by manipulating the prices on which the derivatives are contingent
    — a situation seen most recently in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
    affair.

    markets by distributing risk, but it has been shown recently that in many situations
    risk sharing can also lead to instabilities.

    recent independent lines of research which indicate the more derivatives can make
    market less stable. This work shares some ideas with theoretical ecology, where
    it was once thought (40 years ago) that more complexity in an ecology should generally
    confer stability. Later work suggested instead that complexity (at least too much
    of it) tends to breed instability. According to a number of recent studies, the
    same seems to be true in finance:'

    fluctuations and instabilities for similar reasons. The basis for pricing complex
    derivatives makes several conventional assumptions that amount to the notion that
    trading activity does not feed back on the dynamical behaviour of markets. This
    idealized (and unrealistic) model can have the effect of masking potential instabilities
    in markets. A more detailed picture, taking into account the effects of individual
    trades on prices, reveals the onset of singularities as the number of financial
    instruments increases.

    through regulations, to try to manage the complexity of the financial network
    and encourage its stability. Stability isn't something we should expect to occur
    on its own. It demands real attention to detail. Blind adherence to the idea that
    "more derivatives is good" is a recipe for trouble.

    Guido Caldarelli, Alessandro Chessa, Andrea Gabrielli, Fabio Pammolli and Michelangelo
    Puliga. This work addresses an issue that isn't quite as provocative as the value
    of the derivatives industry, but the topic may be of extreme importance in future
    efforts to devise effective financial regulations. The key insight coming from
    network science is that the architecture of a network -- its topology -- has a
    huge impact on how influences (such as financial distress) spread through the
    network. Hence, global network topology is intimately linked up with system stability;
    knowledge of global structure is absolutely essential to managing systemic risk.
    Unfortunately, the history of law and finance is such that much of the information
    that would be required to understand the real web of links between financial institutions
    remains private, hidden, unknown to the public or to regulators.

    When  financial institutions undertake transactions among themselves, the rest
    of us are also influenced and our economic well being potentially put at risk.
    This information should be public knowledge, because it impacts upon financial
    stability, which is a public good. However, in the absence of new legislation
    to make this happen, regulators can right now turn to more sophisticated methods
    to help reconstruct a more complete picture of global financial networks, filling
    in the missing details. This paper, written by several key experts in this technical
    area, reviews what is now possible and how these methods might be best put to
    use by regulators in the near future.

    Danilo Delpini and Stefano Battiston. "Control" is a word you rarely hear in the
    context of financial markets, I suppose because the near religion of the "free
    market" has made "control" seem like an idea of "communists" or at least "socialists"
    (whatever that means). But regulation of any sort, laws, institutions, even social
    norms and accepted practices, all of these represent some kind of "control" placed
    on individuals and firms in the aim, for society at large, of better outcomes.
    We need sensible control. How to achieve it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, "control" has a long history in engineering science where it is the
    focus of an extensive and quite successful "control theory." This paper reviews
    some recent work which has extended control theory to complex networks. One of
    the key questions is if the dynamics of large complex networks might be controlled,
    or at least strongly steered, by influencing only a small subset of the elements
    making up the network, and perhaps not even those that seem to be the most significant.
    This is, I think, clearly a promising area for further work. Let's take the insight
    of a century and more of control theory and ask if we can't use that to help prevent,
    or give early warnings of, the kinds of disasters that have hit finance in the
    past decade.
