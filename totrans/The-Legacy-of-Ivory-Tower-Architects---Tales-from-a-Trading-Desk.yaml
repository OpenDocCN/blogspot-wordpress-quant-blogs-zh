- en: Much has been written, comments and discussed on the interaction of Ivory Tower
    Architectures and project teams.  Certain organisations I’ve worked for have unfortunately
    built departments of architectures who are so disconnected from the business,
    with obvious consequences – the business builds their own IT mini department/team. 
    Relevance offers an old blog posting with some useful thought on capturing architecture
    decisions on an agile project – particularly useful on multi-year projects.
