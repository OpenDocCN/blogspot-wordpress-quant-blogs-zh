    from 1990 to 2002\.  While most pairs are found to stay within a 15 to 20 basis
    point (.15% to .2%) range with one another, the authors note that "the premium
    on the cross-listed shares relative to home-market shares can be as large as [66
    percent](http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=INFY&selected=INFY)
    and the discounts as large as [87 percent](http://www.adrbnymellon.com/files/TN7963.pdf),"
    but deviations of such magnitude were found to last no longer than one day.""Deviations
    from price parity,” they suggest, “their persistence over time and the excess
    comovements are related to country-level and firm-specific attributes that reflect,
    not only institutional impediments to arbitrage, but also informational barriers
    in the form of information asymmetries among different investors and the presence
    of [noise traders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_trader)."  They find that
    "excess comovements are significantly related to the fraction of global trading
    that takes place in the U.S. markets." [Ejara and Ghosh (2004)](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1560482)

    price of RWEOY duly listed in USD. The market for RWEOY is most robust during
    the overlapping hours when market making firms are able to more easily transfer
    risk from one market to the other. The bid/ask spread of RWEOY after the European
    closing (on the right of the chart) is evidence of this mechanism.
