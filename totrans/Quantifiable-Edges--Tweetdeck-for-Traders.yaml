    Twitter service through the RSS feed. The frustration I’ve experienced in following
    them is that even with an RSS feed the Twitter update may not arrive for an hour
    or so. And even then I’ll only notice it if I happen to flip over to my reader
    application. Trying to follow real-time commentary on a much delayed basis just
    doesn’t provide the same value. This is no fault of theirs as the information
    is good and timely.

    that you are subscribed to. It updates once per minute and can be set to notify
    with a tweet sound and popup when a new tweet arrives. It makes manually refreshing
    Twitter or subscribing to an RSS feed obsolete. I’d strongly recommend everybody
    check out the free twitter services from

    to offer any such service. If anyone knows of other valuable tools or services
    that could be incorporated with Twitter I’d encourage you to post about them in
    the comments section.
