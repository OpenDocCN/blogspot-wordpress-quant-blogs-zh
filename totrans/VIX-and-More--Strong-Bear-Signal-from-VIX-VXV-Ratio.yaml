    to be an indicator in the making.  Since the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    is only six months old it is still too early to give it the robust indicator seal
    of approval, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pay attention to it.

    bearish signal comparable to the current one was just as the markets were about
    to move down in dramatic fashion from late December to late January.

    current market environment.  I suspect the bears are preparing to pounce very
    soon…
