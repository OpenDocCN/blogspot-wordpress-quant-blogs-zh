- en: A big part of Strategas' argument stems from the fact that the period against
    which current earnings are compared — the first half of 2016 — was notably weak.
    And that, in turn, pushed year-over-year growth to unsustainable levels.

    are represented by the blue columns, which show continued profit expansion over
    the next two quarters. Strategas has other ideas. Adjusting for historical factors,
    the firm sees earnings growth declining over the period before being cut almost
    in half by the first quarter of 2018, as indicated by the red columns.

    leading indicator of four-quarter-trailing operating earnings, has gone vertical
    since March 2016\. It works great during economic expansions, but terribly during
    recessions. If there is no recession in sight, then the prediction of this indicator
    is that four-quarter-trailing earnings per share is heading from $126 currently
    (through Q2) to $140 over the next four quarters.
