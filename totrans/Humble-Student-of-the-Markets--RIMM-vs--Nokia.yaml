    to Nokia, who I believe to be in comparatively better shape, tactically RIMM seems
    to be in a better technical position than NOK. Consider this chart of the relative
    performance of the two stocks:'

    Tactically, this sets up RIMM to outperform NOK in the short term.

- en: I would add that the caveat that putting on this pair trade is fraught with
    company specific risk and anyone who enters into this does so at their own risk.
    I would further suggest to define your risk and target levels before entering
    into such a speculative trade.
