    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    with stock prices. Now that both the House Republicans and Senate Republicans
    have different versions of a tax bill, the market is waking up to the challenges
    ahead.

    Further bargaining lies ahead, which has the potential to dilute the bullish effects

    incremental deficit in the next 10 years, and no further deficits after 10 years.
    Any violation of the Byrd Rule would require 60 votes in the Senate, which would
    be challenging as the GOP only has a 52-48 seat majority.

    go down. There were cautionary signals from risk appetite indicators, which signaled
    rising skepticism over the passage of any tax bill. The top panel depicts the
    relative performance of high beta vs. low volatility stocks as a metric of risk
    appetite. Risk appetite perked up in September as the odds of a tax cut became
    more likely, then flattened out into a range. This pair broke down through a relative
    support on Friday. The other pairs show the relative performance of "champagne"
    stocks Sotheby's (BID) and Tiffany's (TIF) against the market. The "champagne"
    stocks have been underperforming the market for the last few months, which is
    another sign of market skepticism that much was going to be accomplished on the
    tax bill.
