    and was pleased to see all the comments and emails. Reflecting on the situation,
    since I have received literally *hundreds* of questions about VXX in the last
    month or two, I have elected to go ahead with a multi-part series on [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    starting next Monday, rather than trying another “Ten Things Everyone Should Know…”
    post like I did with [Ten Things Everyone Should Know About the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html).
    Frankly, limiting myself to just ten facts/issues/misconceptions could not possibly
    do VXX justice and this time around I will do a much deeper dive than I did with
    the VIX.

    this week is over and have therefore attached a chart of the monthly performance
    of VXX going back to the launch of this ETN. The chart lays out the VXX conundrum
    in monthly terms, but the issue is similar across all time frames: do you want
    to take a long position which has a low probability of success, but a high potential
    reward? Of course, the longer the holding period, the more [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    will lower the probability of success, but the better chance there will be that
    an investor will catch a big spike in volatility, like we had in May.'

    position.

    the comments section in the first link below and I’ll see if I can work it into
    next week’s series.
