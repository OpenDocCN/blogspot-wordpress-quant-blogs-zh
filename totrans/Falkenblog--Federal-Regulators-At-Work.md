> As a result of the US Government's complete failure to investigate credible warnings about 'Underwear Bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from none other than Abdulmutallab's father, senior American counterterrorism officials say they have altered their criteria so that a single-source tip can lead to a name being placed on the watch list.

The government's ability to discriminate is basically zero, so you have to choose to allow everything or nothing, because that's all it can decide.
