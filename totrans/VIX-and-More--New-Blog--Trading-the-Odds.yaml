    of statistical knowledge and insight brought to bear by a commenter by the name
    of Frank.

    share in more detail some of his analytical work and thinking in a new blog that
    is going by the name of [Trading the Odds](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/).
    Based on a set of initial posts, it looks as if Frank will be using his considerable
    statistical data bank to talk about weekly and monthly seasonality, RSI (2), mean
    reversion, correlation and other related issues. I have a hunch that anyone who
    appreciates the heavily quantitative and statistical approach to the markets taken
    by the likes of [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) and
    [MarketSci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/) will find Trading the Odds has a
    similar appeal.

    encourage readers to become familiar with his new blog. If anyone needs an additional
    nudge, note that today Frank addresses one of my favorite VIX quirks, [Weekday
    Seasonality of the VIX](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/weekday-seasonality-of-the-vix/),
    which looks at the ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    effect for VIX levels on Fridays and Mondays.
