    some of the stretched conditions I noted late last week. Most notably the CBOE
    put/call ratio and the VIX. (Note that the VIX system I shared Thursday afternoon
    triggered an exit today – good for a 2.43% gain in 3 days.) So now what? Is this
    a buying opportunity? Two days ago the market was hitting 4 month highs. The S&P
    500 today closed about 3.5% below those highs. Let’s take a look at what has happened
    in the past when these kinds of sharp selloffs occur near a high:'

    in the last two. Looking at the 51 other such occurrences where the market has
    gone from a 50-day closing high to a 8-day closing low in two days, the positive
    expectancy going forward peaked after 5 days. A couple of weeks later, expectancy
    was nearly back to flat.

    12 occurrences but results seem notable. In this case the bounce only lasted 3
    days and the expectancy beyond that turned quickly negative and stayed negative.

    would lead me to believe there is a strong chance that the selloff has completely
    run its course.
