    in June 2010, investors who were unwilling to open up a futures account have been
    able to take long and short positions on corn via the CORN ETF, which holds a
    basket of corn futures.

    in general may have been surprised by the big move in CORN, which is up 20% in
    the past two weeks and 28% over the course of the past month. No doubt they probably
    believe that the move in CORN (and corn futures) is likely to soon be exhausted.

    commodity scene to study the history of agricultural commodities prices over the
    years and note that extreme price moves are not uncommon, particularly when unusual
    weather patterns are involved. The chart below uses monthly bars of corn futures
    over the course of the last 20 years. Note that while the June-July 2012 move
    in corn looks impressive, it pales in comparison to the spikes in corn prices
    that occurred in 1994-1996, 2005-2008 and 2010-2011\. In other words, this could
    be just the beginning of a huge move in corn prices, particularly given that the
    price move of the last month or so comes on top of a much higher base.

    to top out at the prior highs of $8.00 per bushel.

    help to become a weather guru, but be forewarned that understanding the weather
    nuances that affect corn prices is no easy task.
