- en: spiked to 15 today. This is the highest reading it’s posted since I began tracking
    it live in 2005\. Backtests to 1995 show only 3 other instances when the market
    was closing at new lows and the CBI was as high as 15\. They occurred in August
    of 1998, September of 2001, and July of 2002\. All three instances eventually
    shot up to mid-30’s or higher. The highest CBI reading was July 2002 at 52\. Needles
    to say, we’re hitting some pretty elite levels here and those other selloffs were
    about as scary as they come.

- en: I’d suggest traders review their own charts of those periods as well to better
    formulate a game plan they'll be comfortable executing. Those selloffs were incredibly
    scary. There was also incredible opportunity for short-term profit at those bottoms.
    The market is going to bounce. I believe it is going to bounce very sharply. It
    may sell off a significant amount price-wise before that bounce occurs. Time-wise
    I still believe we’re only days away from a multi-week bottom. I'm currently on
    the lookout for a washout day or a reversal day that could mark the low.
