    his boast of home phone calls from the US Treasury Secretary--what I would call
    “inside information” (apparently perfectly legal in bond management).

- en: This is even more concerning given PIMCO’s huge holdings in US Treasury bonds,
    which it appears they intentionally try not to aggregate for public consumption. 
    I tried to compile the numbers on total holdings, and my best estimate based on
    mutual fund holdings is $180 billion and over $250 billion applying the allocation
    to other managed accounts.  It looks something like this.

    go unquestioned especially when they deal with $1/4 Trillion of US Treasuries. 
    Please let me know if you have any insight.
