# VIX and More: VXN and RVX Options Coming September 27th

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vxn-and-rvx-options-coming-september.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vxn-and-rvx-options-coming-september.html#0001-01-01)

The CBOE [announced yesterday](http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/index.cfm?section=news&action=detail&id=69259) that it plans to begin trading options on the [VXN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EVXN) (NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index) and the [RVX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5ERVX) (Russell 2000 Volatility Index) as of September 27, 2007.

This announcement comes just [two months](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/futures-now-available-on-vxn-and-rvx.html) after the CBOE began trading futures in the VXN and RVX.

While [VIX and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/) will not quite provide tick by tick coverage of VXN and RVX options, it is a fairly safe bet that I will have more to say about them than just about anyone else.
