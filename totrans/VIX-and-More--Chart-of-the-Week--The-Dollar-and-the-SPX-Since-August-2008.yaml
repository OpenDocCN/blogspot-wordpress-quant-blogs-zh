    better part of the last two years or so they have been doing just that, as the
    [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)

- en: A weaker dollar has a number of influences on stocks, but the most notable is
    that it makes products and services cheaper in foreign markets. Some sectors benefit
    more than others. Heavy equipment and materials companies are beneficiaries of
    a weaker dollar, as is manufacturing in general. Technology is also a sector that
    is heavily dependent upon exports.

    and commodities.
