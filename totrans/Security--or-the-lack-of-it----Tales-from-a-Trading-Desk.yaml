- en: InfoWorld’s article, “One in six Amazon S3 storage buckets are ripe for data-plundering”
    is worth a [read](http://www.infoworld.com/t/cloud-security/one-in-six-amazon-s3-storage-buckets-are-ripe-data-plundering-215349)
    as more and more applications move to leverage the cloud.  Bucket Finder can be
    downloaded [here](http://www.digininja.org/projects/bucket_finder.php).  I think
    for me the wider issue this article highlights is that many “software engineers”
    know little about security, and how to architect, develop and deploy a secure
    application.
