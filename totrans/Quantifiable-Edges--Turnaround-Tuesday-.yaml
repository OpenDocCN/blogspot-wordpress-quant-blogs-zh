- en: With the SPX now falling 3 days in a row I'm begining to see signs that a bounce
    is becoming likely.  One bit of evidence identified by the Quantifinder last night
    was based on the "Turnaround Tuesday" concept.

- en: I’ve shown before that [of all days Tuesday has historically had the highest
    propensity to halt a short-term pullback](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/01/turnaround-tuesdays.html). 
    The study below is specific to a 3-day pullback leading up to a Tuesday.  It was
    last seen in the blog on [August 24, 2010](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/08/turnaround-tuesday.html). 
    I've updated the results. Results still appear to strongly favor the bulls.  The
    market is looking at a gap down this morning so it will be interesting to see
    if it can overcome the negaive momentum and make the turnaround today or in the
    next few days.
