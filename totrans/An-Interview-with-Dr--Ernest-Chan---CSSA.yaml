    I reviewed the [Momentum Trading Strategies Course](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/momentum-trading-strategies?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=mts_course)
    by Quantra (a division of [QuantInsti](https://www.quantinsti.com/?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=CSSA))
    which I reviewed as part of a recent educational journey to improve my quantitative
    skill set. The next course that I will be reviewing is [Mean-Reversion Strategies
    in Python](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/python-mean-reversion-strategies-ernest-chan?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=CSSA)
    which is taught by Dr. Ernest Chan. I have personally read Ernie’s book [“Machine
    Trading”](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Trading-Deploying-Computer-Algorithms-ebook/dp/B01N7NKVG0)
    which is very well written and full of interesting and practical ideas. I have
    also been a follower of his very popular [blog](http://epchan.blogspot.com/) which
    was a pioneer in revealing statistical arbitrage strategies such as pairs-trading.
    Dr. Chan is a thought leader and industry expert and anyone who is in the quantitative
    field has inevitably come across his work in one form or another. I reached out
    to interview him to get a few insights into how to think about quantitative models
    in the modern era. For those that are unfamiliar with Dr. Chan’s work I have provided
    his very impressive (and extensive) industry and educational credentials below.'

    a financial machine learning SaaS, and also the Managing Member of [QTS Capital
    Management, LLC.](https://www.qtscm.com/), a commodity pool operator and trading
    advisor. His primary focus has been on the development of statistical models and
    advanced computer algorithms to find patterns and trends in large quantities of
    data. He has applied his expertise in statistical pattern recognition to projects
    ranging from textual retrieval at IBM Research, mining customer relationship data
    at Morgan Stanley, and statistical arbitrage trading strategy research at Credit
    Suisse, Mapleridge Capital Management, and other hedge funds.'

    that use technical indicators? Can they be profitable in the modern environment? **'

- en: We don’t use machine learning to generate trading signals, but rather to determine
    the probability of profit of the existing trading signals generated by a basic,
    traditional quantitative strategy. This strategy can be a factor model or one
    based on simple technical indicators. This probability of profit can then be used
    to determine the order size, which can be zero if the probability is too low.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Factors and technical indicators are still crucial for the basic strategy. I
    don’t believe that machine learning can replace human intuition and understanding.
    In fact, it should be used to enhance such understanding and risk management.
    The input to a machine learning algorithm is nothing but factors and technical
    indicators.

    trading which would you choose and why?  **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would trade both. Otherwise the portfolio would not be market neutral since
    momentum strategies are typically short beta while mean reversion strategies are
    long. Also, momentum strategies are long “gamma” and “vega”, while mean reversion
    strategies are short. Note that I put quotation marks around such options Greeks
    because we are not really trading options nor implied volatility. I am using these
    terms loosely to indicate an increase in tail movements and realized volatility.

    versus hand-coding their own quantitative systems or using more simple statistical
    tools? For traders that aren’t familiar with coding what do you think is the best

- en: Traditional quant strategies are too easily replicated by other equally intelligent
    traders, hence they suffer more rapid alpha decay. ML strategies have so many
    parameters and nuances that no two traders can possibly have the same strategy.
    For traders who are not experts in machine learning or programming can start with
    a no-code machine learning service such as [predictnow.ai](http://predictnow.ai/).

    their own machine-learning models? **'
  prefs: []

- en: Machine learning requires abundant and correctly engineered features as input.
    I have seen many newbies trying to use 4 or 5 inputs to a ML algorithm. They should
    instead be using at least 100 inputs.

    you use such as Neural Networks vs KNN or Decision Trees? If so why?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decision trees, or the more advanced version called random forest, is the preferred
    ML method for trading. That’s because it doesn’t have as many parameters to fit
    as a neural network, thus reducing the danger of data snooping bias. Also, the
    output of a decision tree is a bunch of conditional decision rules, which are
    much easier to interpret than the nonlinear functions that neural networks use.
    On the other hand, KNN or logistic regression are too simple – they don’t capture
    a lot of the nonlinear dependence between different input features and the output
    return.

    a bit different than in the past. The market seems to move much more quickly and
    reacts to news in ways that are counterintuitive.  Given your vast experience
    with algorithmic trading what new trends or insights have you gathered in the
    last few years? Have you made any specific adjustments or recalibrated your models
    accordingly?**'

- en: Market patterns often deviate from the “norm” over a short period (e.g. 6 months-1
    year), but they often revert to the norm. One needs to diversify so that some
    strategies are enhanced during such periods, even though others are hurt. Such
    regime changes can also be detected or predicted to some extent by machine learning.
