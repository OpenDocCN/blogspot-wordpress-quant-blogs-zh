    large (2%) gap higher.

- en: What was once a very strong tendency now appears to have lost much of its edge
    as four of the last nine 2% Up Gaps have failed to post a close below the gap
    open within the next week. What’s interesting about the "failures" is that they
    all occurred either 1 or 2 days after the market had closed at a 200-day low.
    In fact, the only one that was 2 days after was Monday 11/24/08, which was the
    day after the 11/21/08 occurrence that also didn’t pull back. Monday the market
    was far removed from its 200 day low. Of course SPY would need quite a pullback
    if it were to close below Monday’s open anytime in the next few days.
