- en: I often hear the argument that people like Edward Kennedy (who died Wednesday,
    brother of John F Kennedy), born to wealth and privilege, are to be praised for
    working for the poor, becoming 'public servants' (see Blogging Heads below). My
    ideal servant would not spend all his time trying to boss me around, statistically
    speaking.

    chose a life of power. That choice satisfied an appetite that is far grosser,
    baser, and more anti-social than are any of the more private appetites that many
    rich people often choose to satisfy.'

    They don't write laws that force me to serve their ends.
