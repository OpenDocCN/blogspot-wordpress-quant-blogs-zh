    individual and professional investors about the outlook for the shiny precious
    metal. Notwithstanding the global conspiracy to suppress the gold price*, here
    is my view on gold.

    permabear on bullion. I do believe that the financialization of gold and other
    commodity prices has made the precious metal more volatile. No one complained
    when money poured into GLD and the price was rising, but as

    alternative currency crashed, it created so many margin calls that the effects
    spilled over into gold**.

    termed "a margin clerk market". We saw a disorderly liquidation. Tuesday saw some
    stabilization. Gold tried to rally but ended up only up slightly on the day -
    not good.

    this relationship is testing a long-term relative support zone. Under such panic
    conditions, we may see a decent bounce.

    equities. The dividend yield on the junior gold miner ETF GDXJ is 4.5% according

    bottom may not be in place because investor psychology hasn't gotten bearish enough.
    I have heard anecdotal evidence that people are lined up at the local bullion
    dealer to buy gold bullion and bars - which is contrarian bearish and an indication
    that Joe Public hasn't given up on the precious metal yet.

    in precious metals. Silver, another precious metal, is considered to be the poor
    man's gold and the relative Silver/Gold ratio is an important indicator of precious
    metal risk appetite. As the chart below indicates, this ratio remains in the middle
    of its historical range and is showing no signs of a washout yet.

    develops. Gold could have great upside potential once it bottoms, but prudence
    calls for waiting for some signs of stabilization before getting long. I would
    rather miss the first 10-20% move than lose another 50% should I get long prematurely.
