    hurts performance in the long run. There were many good comments left after that
    post which I will address in the next post on this subject. Today, though, I’m
    long overdue to tell you when I think stops ARE appropriate.

    with breakouts or trend following systems. Traders that buy on a pattern breakout
    do so because their analysis indicates a trend could emerge in the stock or security
    they are trading. A reversal back into the base or below it would invalidate the
    pattern from a technician’s standpoint. Therefore in such cases I believe a stop
    is completely appropriate. Once the pattern “fails” you should no longer be in
    the trade. Of course some people may want to give a little extra leeway rather
    than putting a stop right at a support point, but even so, there is a point where
    the breakout simply didn’t take.

    little patience for a trade to work once I enter it. Most successful breakouts
    have a tendency to work right away, and when the market environment is conducive
    to breakouts there’s just no point in sitting around with dead wood. I’d rather
    exit with a small profit or loss and try the next one.

    in the risk/reward. A big winner can gain several hundred percent if it goes on
    a tear. That makes up for an awful lot of scratches and small losses. As an example
    in 2003 I did a lot of breakout trading. Cup & Handles, Flat Bases, High Tight
    Flags, Double Bottoms, etc. – all based primarily on daily bars. It was a tremendous
    year for trading breakouts because the ones that took caught fire rather quickly.
    It was also one of my best market years. Yet at the end of the year I went back
    and tallied the percentage of breakout trades I took that “worked”. In other words,
    they did better than a very small gain or scratch. My success rate? A little under
    15%. And it was a great year. Why? Tiny losses and massive gains.

    had a better win rate, but the win rate wasn’t important. What was important was
    controlling the losses, and one way to do that was through the use of stops.
