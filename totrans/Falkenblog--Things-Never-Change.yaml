    were an enabler, but investors would have put money into homes other ways too,
    especially with the GSE's guaranteeing so much of it. After that great bit of
    investigative journalism, we should decide as a society to identify all self-interesting,
    overconfident people put them on an ice-flow and send them to a watery grave (excepting
    the good guys who know the good and true, e.g., authors). Good riddance.

    and remedies, leading to decline. You get the feeling society's optimal sphere
    of military control was greater than its optimal governance size, making most
    of its last 5 centuries a disequilibria of waxing and waning coalitions and dynasties.
    I don't think our politics is much better. Certainly, the best of the Romans are
    better than most modern politicians, but bit by bit they misunderstood what was
    sustainable, how to balance authority with sustainable power. Eventually it was

    but had to resort to debasing the currency by decreasing the amount of silver
    in their money, which really took off in the third century AD. As prices rose
    they were totally flummoxed as to the cause, and blamed this on 'greed', a common
    enough political response in the twentieth century to excessive money growth.
    But fundamentally, there was no solution because the size of the Empire was larger
    than could be sustained, and monetizing the debt was a symptom of this problem.
    No politician gets power saying we should do less, the assumption is always that
    a state can achieve whatever it wants if it tries really really hard. Blaming
    symptoms we don't like, such as greed and hubris, is a constant refrain. Some
    things never change.
