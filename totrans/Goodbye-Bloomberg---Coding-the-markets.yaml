    [several](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/bloomberg-and-merrill/) [times](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/06/09/bloomberg-is-dead/)
    before about [Bloomberg](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/06/15/bloomberg-the-traders-intranet/),
    and [why they’re such a blot](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/06/01/25-million-lines-of-fortran/)
    on the etrading landscape. Now we’re in a recession and Bloomberg’s clients all
    want to cut back on those grand a month terminals. More and more I hear folk say
    “why pay a grand a month for an email account ?”

    single dealer channels. The advantages of single dealer channels for dealers are
    obvious. And they can be attractive to clients too – they’re free to clients,
    and can carry innovative offerings that the multi dealer ECNs aren’t nimble enough
    for. But what they lack, by their very nature, is the direct real time price competition
    of the multi dealer RFQ.

    possible. Firstly the moribund LiquidityHub consortium. The tech infrastructure
    is in place for composite prices for a whole range of rate products. The consortium
    could agree to allow members to republish LQH composite price on their single
    dealer channels. Secondly, vendor driven aggregation. Single dealer channels are
    now common enough that vendors have sprung up to service the sector: [Caplin](http://www.caplin.com)
    & [Lightstreamer](http://www.lightstreamer.com/) for instance. The vendors themselves
    could perform the price aggregation in portals. Dealers could reuse vendor supplied
    aggregate or composite prices to make single dealer channel tickets MiFID compliant
    for the buy side by enriching them with the portal prices.'
