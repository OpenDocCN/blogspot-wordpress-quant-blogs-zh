- en: So if you’re building an XLL in VC8, and you’re using a .def file to specify
    the exported symbols, make sure you give the linker a /DEF:myaddin.xll switch.
    Unlike the VC6 linker, VC8 doesn’t automatically pick up the .def. Took me a good
    few hours to figure that, using depends and filemon to look for missing dependencies
    etc. All the time depends was telling me that my XLL was exporting no symbols,
    but I couldn’t see it, so fixated was I on more subtle possible problems.
