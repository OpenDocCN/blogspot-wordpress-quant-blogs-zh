    “[China the Mother of All Black Swans](http://ContrarianEdge.com/2010/02/12/china-the-mother-of-all-black-swans/)“.
      His conclusions on commodity prices and interest rates are right on the mark,
    stating:'

- en: Ok this is a no-brainer for a number of reasons, one being that US interest
    rates are about as low as they can go.  Also, given the large amount of new debt
    issue and increasing stockpiles in China, Japan, and elsewhere, would expect reduced
    appetite at current interest levels.   That said, in uncertain markets, where
    else should China or Japan park their $ inflows?

    the market crisis.    This can be seen in a number of commodity indices.    That
    said, there are specific commodities that are at premiums to historical levels
    (ones that China has been buying).

    driver behind its rise (that said, gold would appear to be ripe for a huge reset,
    similar to the buildup and reset in the 80s).   Copper on the other hand, has
    had a 50% rise since 2009 that can be attributed to demand from China:'

- en: Apparently China is buying copper not only for internal demand, but as a way
    to invest its huge inflow of $s as opposed to investing entirely in US treasuries.
      So really we have to be looking at significantly less US consumption of Chinese
    products or a change in policy around stockpiling industrial commodities, before
    we see these commodities reverting to historic levels.
