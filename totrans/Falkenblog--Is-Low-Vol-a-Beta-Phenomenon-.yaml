- en: that the low volatility anomaly is really just the excess return low beta, and
    this has been well known for 50 years. I think its indisputable that low beta
    underperforms high beta, but I guess that's a fun fact of contention. It's fun
    to find yourself on the minority side of a fact you think other's don't agree
    with.

    beta to average returns) is insufficiently increasing, positive but not as much
    as theory suggests. That''s one implication of the low volatility anomaly, but
    it''s much worse than that. The Low Volatility anomaly targets two things Fama
    can''t admit: the Security Market Line is'

    1500 stocks (in market cap, non etfs, nonfinancials) with lowest beta, those with
    highest beta.  High beta does significantly worse, and low beta significantly
    better, than the market as a whole.'

    stats on monthly returns for portfolios formed via low volatility, low beta, and
    the market (as a comparison).

    is higher for low volatility portfolios.  But look at how a low volatility portfolio
    amongst the bottom 50% of book/market stocks (aka growth stocks) does, relative
    to the low beta portfolio:'

- en: On a Sharpe level, the low vol sorting produces a greater anomaly than the low
    beta sort, and this is highlighted by fact that the Sharpe ratio disparity persists
    with the below average book/market subset.

- en: In all dimensions, the volatility sort is more anomalous than the beta sort.
    Further, there is a return premium to low beta/vol, which simply can't be fit
    within the standard model.
