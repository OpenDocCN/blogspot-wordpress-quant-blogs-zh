    a market bias, and 2) factoring in overbought/oversold measures to improve risk/reward.
    So now let''s assume you''ve done those things, and the situation setting up is
    suggesting a strong directional edge. You''ve either got an upside bias and a
    market that is not "too overbought", or a downside bias and a market that is not
    "too oversold". How do you translate that information into profits?'

    on an index position. This is something that I do a lot of, but index trading
    isn't for everyone and there are many ways to take advantage of a directional
    market edge without trading indices.

    of that edge. Let's use the example of a systems trader that focuses on either
    individual stocks or ETFs. Rather than simply take entries that may occur at any
    time, that trader may elect to use directional market edges as a filter. In other
    words, if there appears to be a strong upside market edge and one of his short
    systems triggers, he could opt to ignore the signal or view it as invalid. But
    if the market edge is to the downside and a short system trade triggers, he could
    jump on it.

    embedded link is a good place to start. For my tests I broke out the system performance
    by times the Aggregator was suggesting a market directional edge in the same direction
    as the system versus times it wasn't. I found that for almost all of my systems,
    statistics were substantially better when you were trading with a directional
    market edge. Times where the Aggregator signal was not confirming the individual
    system signal, the system simply did not fare as well.

    the concept is applicable to discretionary traders as well. If you are able to
    identify a directional market edge then you can consistently apply that information
    in your decision-making. During periods where you expect the market to flourish,
    you should trade the long side more aggressively and the short side more conservatively.
    Those times when you determine there is a downside market edge you should take
    the opposite tack. Trade more aggressively with your short positions and more
    conservatively with your long ones.

    for my subscribers. While some subscribers trade indices and perhaps utilize some
    of the index trade ideas I publish, many of the more astute subscribers simply
    use the information to enhance the application of their own strategies. A few
    public examples of this include David Varadi of CSS Analytics and Ray Barros of
    TradingSuccess.com.

    order to take advantage of quantifiable edges. And you don't need to overhaul
    your trading strategies either. A simple approach like tweaking your aggressiveness
    based on your market outlook can go a long way in improving returns.

- en: Index traders have long understood how to take advantage of directional market
    edges. But for those that trade individual stocks and ETFs, my research suggests
    it makes great sense to take a top-down approach. First determine a directional
    market edge and then look for those stocks or sectors that are set up best to
    take advantage of the anticipated market move. By doing this you'll have the market
    wind at your back and your risk/reward and total profits should benefit accordingly.
