- en: '". In the last two posts I''ve discussed 1) combining historical edges to develop
    a market bias, and 2) factoring in overbought/oversold measures to improve risk/reward.
    So now let''s assume you''ve done those things, and the situation setting up is
    suggesting a strong directional edge. You''ve either got an upside bias and a
    market that is not "too overbought", or a downside bias and a market that is not
    "too oversold". How do you translate that information into profits?'

  zh: 在之前的两篇文章中，我讨论了如何将历史边缘数据相结合来形成市场偏见，以及如何利用超买/超卖指标来优化风险回报比。所以现在假设你已经完成了这些步骤，市场情况表明有一个强烈的方向性边缘。你可能有一个上升的市场偏见，且市场不是“过于超买”，或者有一个下降的市场偏见，且市场不是“过于超卖”。那么你如何将这种信息转化为利润呢？
- en: The most obvious way to try and take advantage of this kind of setup is to take
    on an index position. This is something that I do a lot of, but index trading
    isn't for everyone and there are many ways to take advantage of a directional
    market edge without trading indices.

- en: Another way to apply a directional market edge is to favor trades in the direction
    of that edge. Let's use the example of a systems trader that focuses on either
    individual stocks or ETFs. Rather than simply take entries that may occur at any
    time, that trader may elect to use directional market edges as a filter. In other
    words, if there appears to be a strong upside market edge and one of his short
    systems triggers, he could opt to ignore the signal or view it as invalid. But
    if the market edge is to the downside and a short system trade triggers, he could
    jump on it.

  zh: 另一种应用方向性市场边缘的方法是倾向于交易该边缘方向的市场。让我们以一个专注于个别股票或ETF的系统交易者为例子。与其简单地随时采取可能发生的交易，该交易者可能会选择使用方向性市场边缘作为过滤器。也就是说，如果似乎有一个强烈的上升市场边缘，而他的某个短期系统触发了，他可以选择忽略这个信号或认为它无效。但当市场边缘是向下的时候，一个短期系统交易触发了，他可以立即行动。

    by times the Aggregator was suggesting a market directional edge in the same direction
    as the system versus times it wasn't. I found that for almost all of my systems,
    statistics were substantially better when you were trading with a directional
    market edge. Times where the Aggregator signal was not confirming the individual
    system signal, the system simply did not fare as well.

    the concept is applicable to discretionary traders as well. If you are able to
    identify a directional market edge then you can consistently apply that information
    in your decision-making. During periods where you expect the market to flourish,
    you should trade the long side more aggressively and the short side more conservatively.
    Those times when you determine there is a downside market edge you should take
    the opposite tack. Trade more aggressively with your short positions and more
    conservatively with your long ones.

  zh: 然而，虽然我一直在用机械系统的方法谈论这个概念，但它也适用于主观交易者。如果你能够识别出市场方向的边缘，那么你就可以在决策过程中一致地应用这个信息。在预期市场将繁荣的时期，你应该更积极地交易多头，更保守地交易空头。当你确定存在市场下跌的边缘时，你应该采取相反的策略。更积极地交易你的空头仓位，多头仓位则更保守。

- en: Index traders have long understood how to take advantage of directional market
    edges. But for those that trade individual stocks and ETFs, my research suggests
    it makes great sense to take a top-down approach. First determine a directional
    market edge and then look for those stocks or sectors that are set up best to
    take advantage of the anticipated market move. By doing this you'll have the market
    wind at your back and your risk/reward and total profits should benefit accordingly.

  zh: 指数交易员长期以来一直知道如何利用市场方向的边缘。但对于那些交易个股和ETF的交易者来说，我的研究建议采取自上而下的方法是有很大意义的。首先确定一个市场方向的边缘，然后寻找那些最能利用预期市场变动的股票或板块。通过这样做，你将拥有市场的支持，你的风险/回报和总利润应该会相应地改善。
