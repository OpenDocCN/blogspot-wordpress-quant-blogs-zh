    with today’s [announcement](http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=541946)
    by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) that it will begin disseminating
    implied volatility data utilizing the VIX calculation methodology for five stocks
    as of Friday, January 7^(th).

    notably Apple, Google and Amazon

    and now with volatility indices for individual stocks, the CBOE has managed to
    shorten the scope of volatility analysis both at the issue level and in terms
    of the time frame. I’m calling this the march toward [atomic volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/atomic%20volatility).
