- en: SPY volume came in at the lowest level in over a month on Monday. Very low SPY
    volume when the market is at or near highs is often a bearish sign. A few studies
    related to this appeared in the Quantifinder this evening. I decided to examine
    the combination of a 20-day low in volume combined with a 50-day high in price.

- en: Over the next 2 to 3 days there appears to be a solid downside edge based on
    the numbers. While I expected this to be the case, I was somewhat surprised to
    see that the edge persisted well beyond that. While I frequently show profit curves
    in the Subscriber Letter, I rarely do so on the blog. Today I decided to show
    it. So here it is using a 2-day holding period.
