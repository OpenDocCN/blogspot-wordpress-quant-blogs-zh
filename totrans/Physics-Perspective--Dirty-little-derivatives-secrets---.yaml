    secret to those in the financial industry, but unknown to most others who still
    think financial markets in some approximation are fair and efficient -- is that
    some of the big banks control the market and expressly inhibit competition to
    protect their profits. I just stumbled across

    that derivatives make markets more efficient because they make them more "complete."
    As Eugen Fama puts it: "Theoretically, derivatives increase the range of bets
    people can make, and this should help to wipe out potential inefficiencies." Available
    information, the idea goes, should flow more readily into the market. But the
    truth seems to be that derivatives make banks more profitable at everyone''s collective
    expense, and not only because they make markets more unstable (see more on this
    below). From the'

- en: Two years ago, Kenneth C. Griffin, owner of the giant hedge fund Citadel Group,
    which is based in Chicago, proposed open pricing for commonly traded derivatives,
    by quoting their prices electronically. Citadel oversees $11 billion in assets,
    so saving even a few percentage points in costs on each trade could add up to
    tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

    and what happened is a window into how banks have fiercely fought competition

    prowess for a joint venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is best-known
    as a trading outpost for contracts on commodities like coffee and cotton. The
    goal was to set up a clearinghouse as well as an electronic trading system that
    would display prices for credit default swaps.

    Citadel’s idea. Electronic trading might connect customers directly with each
    other, cutting out the banks as middlemen.

    and other big banks used to block this idea, or at least to make sure they'd be
    locked into the gears of such an electronic exchange. Eventually the whole idea
    fell apart to the banks' relief. Guess who's paying the price?

    yet having electronic trading. He puts the toll, by a rough estimate, in the tens
    of billions of dollars, saying that electronic trading would remove much of this
    “economic rent the dealers enjoy from a market that is so opaque.”

    in the derivatives market are very apprehensive about whether or not they will
    be winners or losers as we move towards more transparent, fairer markets, and
    since they’re not sure if they’ll be winners or losers, their basic instinct is
    to resist change.”'

    this goes back to the question of whether these instruments really do have benefits,
    by making markets more efficient, perhaps, or if instead they might make them
    more unstable and prone to collapse. Warren Buffet was certainly clear in his
    opinion, expressed in his newsletter (

    bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system." But the
    disconcerting truth about derivatives emerges in more certain terms from new,
    fundamental analyses of how precisely they can stir up natural market instabilities.'

    impact that derivatives have on markets. Derivatives can obviously let people
    hedge risks -- locking in affordable fuel for the winter months in advance, for
    example. But they're used for risk taking as much as hedging, and can easily create
    collective market instability. These two studies show -- from within the framework
    of economic theory itself -- that adding derivatives to markets in pursuit of
    the nirvana of market completeness should indeed make those market less stable,
    not more.

    these works in more detail. I hope to get this up very shortly. Meanwhile, these
    two examples of science on the topic might be something to keep in mind as the
    banks try hard to confuse the issue and obscure what ought to be the real aim
    of financial reform -- to return he markets to their proper role as semi-stable
    systems providing funds for creative and valuable enterprise. Markets should be
    a public good, not a rigged casino, benefiting the few, and guaranteed by the
    public.
