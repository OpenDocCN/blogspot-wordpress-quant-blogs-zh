    to Sell](http://www.amazon.com/When-Sell-Strategies-Stock-Market-Profits/dp/0870341340/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1842513-2805206?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182183976&sr=1-1),
    which was written by Justin Mamis in 1977\. Among the books many gems Mamis unveils
    is the Overbought-Oversold Indicator, which is a simple 10 day moving average
    of the NYSE advances minus declines. Helene Meisler, a Mamis protégé, [later popularized](http://www.thestreet.com/story/722372/helene-meislers-technical-indicators-a-primer.html)
    the Overbought-Oversold Indicator and blogger Ron Sen at [Technically Speaking](http://ronsen.blogspot.com/)
    has championed the same indicator over the past few years, usually adding in a
    30 day moving average for comparison purposes and calling it the Mamis-Meisler
    Breadth Oscillator.

    oscillator can be a trader’s best friend and with the SPX for now at least apparently
    stuck in a trading range between 1070 and 1150, breadth becomes an important piece
    of the overall technical puzzle.

    (MOOI?) and shows negative extremes in the 10 day moving average (solid blue line)
    of at least -400 to be solid predictors of oversold conditions. The positive extremes
    (dotted red line) of +700 or so are less valuable in terms of calling market tops,
    but often presage a selloff. Right now, the indicator suggests a bullish oversold
    market.

    reliable market breadth oscillator can be a powerful timing tool.
