## VoltDB Financial Usage

Interesting [read](http://www.eagleinvsys.com/about-eagle/news.cfm?id=VoltDB%20and%20Eagle%20Investment%20Systems%20Align%20to%20Deliver%20High-Velocity%20Big%20Data%20Solutions%20to%20Financial%20Services%20Market) over on Eagle Investment Systems about its usage of Dr. Michael Stonebraker’s VoltDB database technology.  Shame the article doesn’t provide insight into the evaluation criteria, and other products evaluated:

> Eagle conducted an extensive evaluation process for a high-velocity in-memory database capable of meeting the rigid demands of the financial services industry.
