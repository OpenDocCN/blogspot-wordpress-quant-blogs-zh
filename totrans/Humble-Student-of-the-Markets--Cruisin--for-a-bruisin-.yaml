- en: reported that BAML strategist Michael Harnett wrote a report back on December
    12 forecasting a melt-up. He believed the market's gains would be front loaded
    in 2020\. and he projected an S+P 500 target of 3,333 by March 3\. The index reached
    that level intra-day today, and it's still January. Are the front-loaded gains
    over?

    bull-bear spread has reached the highest level since October 2018.
