    with a baseline strategy to identify bull and bear markets.  Now we should look
    at how to use this information when combined with new information–ie we are trying
    to calculate how much to bet using  contingent probability data. There are two
    ways to go about this: 1) ***“back of the envelope”*** – estimation using both
    historical data, and some adjustments based on human logic 2) ***using advanced statistical
    forecasts:***  forecasting using  conditional probabilities where the correlation
    and interaction between independent variables are considered.'

    reality is that most traders are not equipped, or knowledgeable enough to effectively
    use #2 on a day-to day basis. There is a big difference between the ideal world
    of numbers and the rough and tumble world of trading*.* I would compare #1 and
    2 using the following analogy: you wouldn’t want to send a soldier into war with
    a new weapon that was complicated or difficult to use without adequate training.
    Besides, good human judgement combined with basic historical data (properly used)
    can produce solid results that are more robust than poorly-executed quantitative
    models.'

    Rob Hanna’s ***Quantifiable Edges*** [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) .
    In general, Rob usually presents a specific situation that is directly comparable to
    the current environment. He then presents historical data for what you would have
    made or lost by trading under this specific contingency. Suppose our primary trading
    vehicle is the SPY, here is a practical example:'

    of what the specific results are when we are in a bull or bear market. We have
    to combine our new information to figure out how much to bet. Let’s further assume

    portfolio. As you can see, the above methodology is practical because it allows
    us to quantify how much to bet, and also can incorporate adjustments based on
    our own judgement of the situation. Often traders struggle with determining how
    much to bet and whether or not to take profits, or switch positions. Using the
    MDVK to calculate a combined “f”, gives you a concrete answer as to the current
    position that you should be taking. While it is not meant to be highly precise,
    it is far better than a “seat of the pants” decision made under pressure close
    to the closing bell. It is a highly structured framework to take into account
    the 1) the current long term trend 2) volatility 3) risk/reward ratios and 4)
    contingent situations.

    week so that it can be used for real-life trading. In part 3 we will look at using
    statistics to make more precise conditional forecasts. This is a topic that we
    will build upon slowly as I introduce various statistical procedures and their
    applications as well as  pros/cons. On Tuesday we will look at  how to perform 
    “back of the envelope” robust optimization procedures to figure out how to trade
    pairs. However this method is applicable to optimizing any trading system without
    overfitting.
