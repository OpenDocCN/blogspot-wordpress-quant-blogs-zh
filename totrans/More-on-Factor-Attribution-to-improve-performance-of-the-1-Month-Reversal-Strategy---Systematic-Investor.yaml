    Strategy](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/factor-attribution-to-improve-performance-of-the-1-month-reversal-strategy/),
    I discussed how [Factor Attribution](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/example-of-factor-attribution/)
    can be used to boost performance of the [1-Month Reversal Strategy](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/1-month-reversal-strategy/).
    Today I want to dig a little dipper and examine this strategy for each sector
    and also run a sector-neutral back-test.

    Factor Attribution are the same as in the original [post](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/factor-attribution-to-improve-performance-of-the-1-month-reversal-strategy/),
    so I will not repeat them here. The complete source code for this example is located
    in the [bt.fa.sector.one.month.test() function in bt.test.r at github](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT/blob/master/R/bt.test.r)
    for your reference. The new functionality to create sector and sector-neutral
    back-tests is located in the bt.make.quintiles.sector() function below:'

    based on the 1 Month returns (one.month) and the Residuals from the Factor Attribution
    regression (last.e_s). In all cases the Residual strategy outperformed the base
    one and also the sector-neutral versions have better risk-adjusted coefficients
    compared to the overall strategy.

    found that Energy, Materials, and Utilities underperformed in both cases and Financials
    and Consumer Staples did very well in both cases. Looking at the sector back-test
    charts, I think the Momentum strategy that selects top few sectors each month
    would do very well. You can try implementing this idea as a homework.
