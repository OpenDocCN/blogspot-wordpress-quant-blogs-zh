- en: Joe Biden has officially clinched the Democratic nomination for president, and
    his odds of winning the Presidency in November have been steadily rising, and
    he is now at 54% on PredictIt. For the uninitiated, the contract pays off at $1.00
    if a candidate wins, so buying the Biden contract at $0.54 implies a 54% of a
    Biden victory.

  zh: Joe Biden 已正式锁定民主党总统候选人提名，他在 11 月赢得总统宝座的赔率一直在稳步上升，目前已在 PredictIt 上达到 54%。对于新手来说，如果候选人获胜，该合约支付
    1.00 美元，因此以 0.54 美元购买拜登合约意味着拜登获胜的可能性为 54%。

  zh: 民主党掌控参议院的概率在过去几个月中一直在稳步提升，现在显示民主党略微领先。在 50-50 的分裂参议院情况下，副总统将投下决定性的一票，而白宫的胜利者将掌握控制权。
- en: While this is not meant to be an endorsement of any candidate or political party,
    it is time to contemplate what a Biden victory might mean for the economy and
    the markets. If Biden were to win, there is also a decent chance that the Democrats
    might capture control of both chambers of Congress. How should investors react
    to that outcome?

  zh: 虽然这并不是对任何候选人或政治党的背书，但现在是要思考拜登获胜可能对经济和市场意味着什么的时候了。如果拜登赢得胜利，民主党组阁还有相当大的可能性会控制参众两院。投资者应该如何应对这种结果？
