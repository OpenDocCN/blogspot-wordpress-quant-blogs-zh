- en: I have two thoughts ahead of the March Jobs Report that investors should consider.
    Let's start with the tactical picture of what Friday's reports might bring.

    shutdown, which can make the reported figures nonsensical. Now that the effects
    of the shutdown are mostly over, we can get a better idea of the overall trend.

- en: One clue comes from the weekly initial jobless claims data, which is reported
    on a timely basis. As the chart below shows, the week of the February Jobs Report
    survey coincided with an unusually strong initial claims print, which may have
    contributed to the shocking miss in the February NFP report of 20K jobs. Initial
    claims for the March survey week weakened to a level consistent with January's.
    In light of the strong January NFP print of 304K jobs, which was later revised
    to 311K, this suggests that an in line or beat result for March headline NFP estimate
    of 175K.

    a new development is likely to affect how the Fed views employment data, which
    could affect thinking on future policy.
