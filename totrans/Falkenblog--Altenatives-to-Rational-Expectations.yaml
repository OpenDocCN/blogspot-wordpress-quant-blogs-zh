- en: When Rational Expectations was developed in the 1960s most people thought it
    was a classic academic result.  Certainly mutual fund managers chuckled at the
    thought a monkey could outperform a skilled professional.  Further, everyone had
    a stupid relative, neighbor,  or co-worker, that proved people were not rational.
    Meanwhile, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (ie, Beta), meanwhile, was accepted
    as true even before data suggested it was.

    outperform naive benchmarks (Cowles foundation (1932), Malkiel's Random Walk Down
    Wall Street (1973)), making the signature prediction of rational expectations
    surprising and true, a sign of a great theory.  Samuelson’s (1965) application
    of the law of iterated expectations to explain why Bachelier (1900) notices that
    securities prices look like a random walk, made for both elegant theory and voluminous
    evidence. The efficient markets theory reached its current plateau in 1970 with
    Fama's articulation of what efficient markets mean, but never has it been generally
    accepted by practitioners or non-economists, and there have always been many economists
    looking at exceptions to this rule.

    with subsets vs. supersets, for example, the odds that Hillary Clinton (Democrat)
    will win the Presidency is less than the probability a Democrat will win the Presidency,

    something silly like 10% or the odds of a US default at 5%, that doesn't mean
    derivatives are priced that way, because knowledgeable people with capital tend
    to arbitrage these beliefs out of the market. For example,

    point out that in low-stakes environments people make logical mistakes in predictable
    ways, but they hardly ever explain the yield curve, the equity premium, or anything
    else important, but rather, the poor returns to 100-1 horses or some other curiosity.
    I like betting on horse longshots at the track and implicitly pay a premium for
    that, but it probably costs less than what I spend on beer at the track, so it's
    really not complicated.

    evolutionary success. I think that's great, and indeed, think that a relative
    utility function makes more sense because, among other reasons, it is more evolutionarily
    robust.
