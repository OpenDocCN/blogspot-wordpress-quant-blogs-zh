## WPF: Microsoft Conference Call II

I’ve just finished another conference call with a few members of the WPF team – Rob Relyea, Principal Architect for WPF and Kevin Gjerstad, Principal Group Program Manager for WPF. Thanks to Stevan Vidich, Industry Architect Microsoft Financial Services for setting up the Live Meeting sessions. Hopefully in the future I’ll be able to blog about some of the items that were discussed.
