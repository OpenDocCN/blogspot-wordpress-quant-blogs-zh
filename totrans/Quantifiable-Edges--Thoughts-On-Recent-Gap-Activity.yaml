    the 10-day absolute average gap over the 100-day absolute average gap on the charts
    page in the members section of the site. Meanwhile I observed the average true
    range is still below normal. I’ve copied the two charts from the website to illustrate.

    is unusual with the market near new highs. It’s also unusual when there isn’t
    also a substantial increase in the intraday range. I looked at this a number of
    different ways last night. The 10/100 Absolute Avg Gap is 1.38 (meaning the 10ma
    is 38% larger than the 100ma of the overnight gap size). I looked at other instances
    where similar levels were approached and the market was near a new high. It’s
    been fairly unusual over the last 15 years and results were inconclusive.

    intraday range (not the true range as shown above). Here again I found we are
    at very high levels but past history was choppy and inconclusive.

    and the 10-day average intraday range was well below normal. Again I could find
    nothing suggesting a significant directional edge.

- en: So is this activity suggestive of anything? Perhaps. While the readings themselves
    don’t seem to help greatly in predicting direction, they do indicate some unusual
    behavior. My take is that the market is being influenced more by outside forces
    than is customary. It’s been noted by many that the dollar has been leading everything
    by the nose lately. Outside influences like Dubai debt have also had an overnight
    influence lately. This would seem to explain why such a large percentage of action
    is occurring overnight.

    cognizant of dollar and other intramarket action. 2) Perhaps don’t put quite as
    much weight on standard price, volume and breadth indicators as usual. The studies
    have done quite well as of late. Still, it may be worth trading with a bit more
    caution than usual until the stock market manages to decouple from the dollar
    a little bit.
