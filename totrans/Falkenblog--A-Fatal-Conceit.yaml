    (presumably via the logic of the government multiplier, which implies a free lunch
    to deficit spending). Alas, economists are responsible for allowing this kind
    of wishful thinking to be intellectual defensible (though, I believe, wrong).

- en: The appropriate level of overall government spending should be determined by
    adding up the level of specific spending on worthwhile things. Programs that are
    ineffective, or whose impact is small relative to the impact of the taxes needed
    to pay for them, should be cut or eliminated. Programs that are good should be
    maintained or expanded. Settling on an arbitrary number first and then making
    unspecified cuts to reach the target is ridiculous.

    This happens only very rarely, and via strong opposition. AFDC and busing were
    only tossed because of Republican action, there was no internal re-assessment
    by the original Democratic proponents. Basically, no political movement admits
    when in oversteps, making it very rare.

    most liberals, think the solution to any failed policy is to double down.'

    there's always some speculative spill-over effects that can act as a pretext to
    maintain some patronage system.
