    in Finance and then tackled the CFA designation. I was typically instilled with
    the “Efficient Markets Hypothesis” and often could be found reading arcane issues
    of “The Journal of Portfolio Management.” That was also a distant time when I
    thought CAPM was the single greatest equation in finance. I started my career
    many years ago in equity research, and then moved on to a stint in wealth management
    and investment advisory. I had the unique benefit of spending most of early years
    without looking at technical analysis. I spent years doing both macro-economic
    and company research, and also invested heavily in research using fundamental
    scoring systems. My early heroes were Joel Greenblatt, Michael Price, and David
    Dreman–all pioneers in original fundamental research. While it may be unbelievable
    to loyal blog readers, ***I distinctly remember the days when I used to scoff
    derisively at anyone who begged me to look at a stock chart!*** Now, after becoming
    a technical analysis convert so to speak, I have a fair degree of perspective
    to share on what technical analysis can and cannot accomplish.'

    in fundamental analysis, I believe that technical analysis would not work.***
    Huh? Well the truth is, all major trends including both bull and bear markets
    are a function of the belief in some theory about fundamentals. Few individuals
    with serious wealth are willing to risk their own money on the basis of an interpretation
    of a chart pattern. Imagine telling a client that has given you $25 million to
    invest that you are going to be investing $5 million in China Telecom because
    “the chart looks good.” Or how about trying to tell that same person that you
    are going to increase your exposure to Citigroup in 2008 “because my indicators
    show that the stock has hit a bottom.” You better have a good reason to explain
    to this same person why you are risking their hard-earned money on a bunch of
    chart squiggles. For this reason, most of the money in the mutual fund and pension
    fund universe is invested using fundamental research and macro-economic theses
    about a specific stock, sector or commodity. Typical examples include statements
    such as: “the world is running out of oil”, or that “the internet is going to
    take over brick and mortar business.”'

    feedback loops that start with a few people believing in a given theory and end
    with the majority achieving a consensus that a theory is true.***'

- en: One implication of this process is that the proximity to a long-term top or
    to a bottom can be better approximated using gauges of sentiment rather than classic
    technical indicators. Based on the theory postulated above, major moves will start
    occuring when the majority of people do not believe that a market will reverse
    course based on fundamental reasons. The smart/more informed money will often
    be placing their bets ahead of the crowd without moving the market. By extension,
    this also means that major turning points will be difficult to distinguish since
    the money flow into a given stock or market will likely be offset by the majority
    of investors betting in the opposite direction. No technical indicator in my experience
    is capable of telling you with any accuracy where the top or bottom is. I have
    never tested or seen anything that can accomplish this significant feat of prediction.
    Strangely, it seems that most newsletters and market pundits spend most of their
    time calling tops and bottoms. Perhaps this is why they always seem to underperform
    buy and hold or a simple 200-day moving average rule despite having arguably excellent
    knowledge of a wide variety of truly predictive indicators.

- en: '***The reality is that the fallability of technical indicators is a major limit
    of technical analysis that cannot be addressed adequately by trying to be more
    precise.*** The sad fact is that this never-ending quest for precision is the
    undoing of many great chartists. Many technical analysts fall prey to “confirmation
    bias” after analyzing a market because they are desperately looking for some “non-confirming
    divergence” or other magical signs that they are still correct in their analysis.
    This same problem also affects quants that trade mechanically: no hidden mathematical
    transform of price and/or volume (or combination thereof) holds the key to predicting
    all markets with significant accuracy. At some point no matter how sophisticated
    you are in your analysis, you will reach a maximum bound of profitability that
    can be achieved by looking at prices and volume in isolation. This bound can only
    be surpassed by incorporating variables that are not multi-collinear with price-based
    indicators. Not only is it easier to improve your precision with other variables,
    but you also run a much lower chance of having a poor reward to risk ratio.'
