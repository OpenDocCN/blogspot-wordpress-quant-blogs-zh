    in Finance and then tackled the CFA designation. I was typically instilled with
    the “Efficient Markets Hypothesis” and often could be found reading arcane issues
    of “The Journal of Portfolio Management.” That was also a distant time when I
    thought CAPM was the single greatest equation in finance. I started my career
    many years ago in equity research, and then moved on to a stint in wealth management
    and investment advisory. I had the unique benefit of spending most of early years
    without looking at technical analysis. I spent years doing both macro-economic
    and company research, and also invested heavily in research using fundamental
    scoring systems. My early heroes were Joel Greenblatt, Michael Price, and David
    Dreman–all pioneers in original fundamental research. While it may be unbelievable
    to loyal blog readers, ***I distinctly remember the days when I used to scoff
    derisively at anyone who begged me to look at a stock chart!*** Now, after becoming
    a technical analysis convert so to speak, I have a fair degree of perspective
    to share on what technical analysis can and cannot accomplish.'

  zh: 我的早期教育非常典型：我去商学院获得了金融MBA学位，然后攻读了CFA资格。我通常被灌输“有效市场假说”的理论，经常能看到我在阅读《投资组合管理杂志》上的晦涩问题。那也是一个遥远的时代，当时我认为资本资产定价模型是金融领域中最伟大的方程之一。许多年前，我开始了我的职业生涯，先是从事股票研究，然后进入财富管理和投资顾问领域。我有幸在早年大部分时间内没有接触技术分析。我花了很多年做宏观经济和公司研究，也在使用基本面评分系统进行了大量投资研究。我的早期偶像是乔尔·格林布拉特、迈克尔·普莱斯和大卫·德雷曼——都是原始基本研究的先驱者。尽管对于忠实的博客读者来说可能难以置信，***我清楚地记得那些以前嘲笑我看股票走势图的日子！***
    现在，成为技术分析的信徒之后，我有相当多的见解可以分享关于技术分析能做什么和不能做什么。
- en: 'First, let me state a unique premise: ***without other market players believing
    in fundamental analysis, I believe that technical analysis would not work.***
    Huh? Well the truth is, all major trends including both bull and bear markets
    are a function of the belief in some theory about fundamentals. Few individuals
    with serious wealth are willing to risk their own money on the basis of an interpretation
    of a chart pattern. Imagine telling a client that has given you $25 million to
    invest that you are going to be investing $5 million in China Telecom because
    “the chart looks good.” Or how about trying to tell that same person that you
    are going to increase your exposure to Citigroup in 2008 “because my indicators
    show that the stock has hit a bottom.” You better have a good reason to explain
    to this same person why you are risking their hard-earned money on a bunch of
    chart squiggles. For this reason, most of the money in the mutual fund and pension
    fund universe is invested using fundamental research and macro-economic theses
    about a specific stock, sector or commodity. Typical examples include statements
    such as: “the world is running out of oil”, or that “the internet is going to
    take over brick and mortar business.”'

  zh: 首先，让我陈述一个独特的前提：***如果没有其他市场参与者相信基本面分析，我相信技术分析是不起作用的。*** 哦？事实是，所有主要趋势，包括牛市和熊市，都是基于某种关于基本面的理论的信念。几个真正有财富的个人不愿意冒着自己的钱去相信对图表模式的解释。想象一下，告诉一个已经给了你2500万美元投资的客户，你将要投资500万美元在中国电信上，因为“图表看起来不错。”
    或者试图告诉同一个人，你将在2008年增加对花旗集团的投资，“因为我的指标显示该股已经触底。” 你最好有一个充分的理由向这个同样的人解释，为什么你要冒着他们辛苦挣来的钱去投资一堆图表曲线。因此，大多数共同基金和养老基金领域的资金都是使用基本研究和宏观经济论点来投资于特定股票、行业或商品的。典型的例子包括以下声明：“世界正在耗尽石油”，或者“互联网将取代传统实体企业。”
- en: '***Not some, but nearly ALL major bubbles or parabolic moves are created by
    feedback loops that start with a few people believing in a given theory and end
    with the majority achieving a consensus that a theory is true.***'

  zh: '***几乎所有主要的泡沫或拱形走势都是由反馈循环产生的，这种循环始于少数人相信某一理论，最终大多数人达成共识，认为这一理论是正确的。***'
- en: One implication of this process is that the proximity to a long-term top or
    to a bottom can be better approximated using gauges of sentiment rather than classic
    technical indicators. Based on the theory postulated above, major moves will start
    occuring when the majority of people do not believe that a market will reverse
    course based on fundamental reasons. The smart/more informed money will often
    be placing their bets ahead of the crowd without moving the market. By extension,
    this also means that major turning points will be difficult to distinguish since
    the money flow into a given stock or market will likely be offset by the majority
    of investors betting in the opposite direction. No technical indicator in my experience
    is capable of telling you with any accuracy where the top or bottom is. I have
    never tested or seen anything that can accomplish this significant feat of prediction.
    Strangely, it seems that most newsletters and market pundits spend most of their
    time calling tops and bottoms. Perhaps this is why they always seem to underperform
    buy and hold or a simple 200-day moving average rule despite having arguably excellent
    knowledge of a wide variety of truly predictive indicators.

  zh: 这个过程的一个含义是，使用情绪指标而不是传统的技术指标来更好地逼近长期顶部或底部的临近位置。根据上述理论，当大多数人都不相信市场会因基本面原因而反转时，主要的市场动向将会开始发生。明智/更了解情况的资金通常会在人群之前下注而不推动市场。由此扩展，这也意味着重大转折点将难以区分，因为流入特定股票或市场的资金可能会被大多数投资者下注相反方向所抵消。在我的经验中，没有任何技术指标能够准确地告诉你顶部或底部在哪里。我从未测试过或看到过任何能够完成这一重要预测壮举的东西。奇怪的是，似乎大多数新闻简报和市场评论家把大部分时间都花在预测顶部和底部上。或许这就是为什么他们总是表现得不如买入持有或简单地遵循200天移动平均线规则，尽管他们在对各种真正具有预测性的指标的了解上可能有值得争议的优秀知识。
- en: '***The reality is that the fallability of technical indicators is a major limit
    of technical analysis that cannot be addressed adequately by trying to be more
    precise.*** The sad fact is that this never-ending quest for precision is the
    undoing of many great chartists. Many technical analysts fall prey to “confirmation
    bias” after analyzing a market because they are desperately looking for some “non-confirming
    divergence” or other magical signs that they are still correct in their analysis.
    This same problem also affects quants that trade mechanically: no hidden mathematical
    transform of price and/or volume (or combination thereof) holds the key to predicting
    all markets with significant accuracy. At some point no matter how sophisticated
    you are in your analysis, you will reach a maximum bound of profitability that
    can be achieved by looking at prices and volume in isolation. This bound can only
    be surpassed by incorporating variables that are not multi-collinear with price-based
    indicators. Not only is it easier to improve your precision with other variables,
    but you also run a much lower chance of having a poor reward to risk ratio.'

  zh: '**现实是，技术指标的局限性是技术分析的主要限制，无法通过试图更加精确来充分解决。** 悲哀的事实是，这种永无止境的精确度追求是许多伟大图表分析师的毁灭。许多技术分析师在分析市场后容易受到“确认偏差”的影响，因为他们迫切地寻找一些“非确认的背离”或其他神奇的迹象，以证明他们的分析仍然是正确的。这个问题也影响到了机械交易的数量分析师：没有任何隐藏的价格和/或成交量（或其组合）的数学变换能够显著准确地预测所有市场。无论你的分析多么复杂，你最终会在孤立地查看价格和成交量时达到最大盈利能力。要超越这个界限，只能通过整合与基于价格的指标不多重共线的变量。不仅通过其他变量提高精确度更容易，而且你还能降低获得较差回报/风险比的机会。'
