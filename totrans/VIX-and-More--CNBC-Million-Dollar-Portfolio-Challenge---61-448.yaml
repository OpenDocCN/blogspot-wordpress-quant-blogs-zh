    Tuesday were not enough top off my humility tank, yesterday saw [Amkor Technology
    (AMKR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en) shave another 1.9% off
    of my portfolio. Just for good measure, today’s pick, [Open Text (OTEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=otex&hl=en),
    is currently tracking down 4.5%.

    as its top pick from yesterday, [Charter Communications (CHTR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=chtr&hl=en),
    is currently trading up a little over 3%.  In a contest like this one, though,
    half the fun is throwing caution to the wind and overriding what your stock picking
    system is telling you what to do – which is exactly what I intend to do again
    today.

    be somewhat heartened to know that I am toying with a new kind of stop, a so-called
    *behavioral stop*.  Don’t look for this term on [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/search/results.aspx?q=behavioral+stop&submit=Go),
    however, as I just made it up.  I define a behavioral stop as “metric-based trigger
    that is designed to force an individual from continuing on a course of repeating
    a particular self-destructive investment behavior.”  For example:  if I drop out
    of the top 10%, then I stop playing volatility roulette.'
