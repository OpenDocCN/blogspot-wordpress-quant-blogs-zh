**Abstract:**

As the end of 2012 draws closer, the crude oil market is entering the late stages of the commodity cycle. Despite political tension in the Middle East and monetary policies such as quantitative easing, the fundamentals still point to an increased risk of falling prices for crude oil. In this Webcast, Bloomberg Industries analyst Christian O'Neill will examine the effects that declining U.S. and EU demand will have on the global market; supply growth in the contiguous U.S. that could be surprising in scope and duration; and other factors likely to impact the market in the near and long term.
