- en: Continuing the strong bounce off of the mid-August lows, Portfolio A1 exited
    the week with fewer scars than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index.  Now up 13.3%
    since the February 16, 2007 inception, the portfolio’s performance compares favorably
    to a 3.7% gain in the SPX.  In spite of the recent performance, as I have discussed
    [previously](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/portfolio-a1-looks-to-ag-to-stop.html),
    I will retire the 100% mechanical Portfolio A1 at the end of the calendar year
    and replace it with a more complex portfolio that incorporates some discretionary
    thinking and more active management on my part.

    the Chinese internet company, is being dropped from the portfolio and will be
    replaced by [StatoilHydro (STO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sto), the
    state-owned Norwegian oil giant.
