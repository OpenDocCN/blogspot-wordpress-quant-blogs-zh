    says: ''Risk is not an add-on … it permeates the whole body of thought.'' Yet
    it receives only a minor mention that passes so quickly here, as if not to dwell
    on it long enough to elicit any follow up, such as "which stocks are riskier than
    than others?" If it''s value stocks, why do they have lower betas and volatility
    than growth stocks? If it''s small-cap stocks, in what way are they risky, other

    grown stronger, led mainly by the obvious fact that it is very difficult to make
    abnormal returns in the market. Fama gets a lot of flack for it since day 1, but
    it has been his most enduring idea (clearly, a group effort with Working, Samuelson,
    and Muth). The risk premium, however, started off as a

    risk premiums exist, so for most economists, one doesn't need proof. This is nice
    because we don't have any other than the supposed equity risk premium, which even
    if it is 3.5% as most experts think, should generalize to something other than
    the difference in return between equities and bonds (eg, cross sectionally, over
    time, across futures, currencies, bonds, etc).
