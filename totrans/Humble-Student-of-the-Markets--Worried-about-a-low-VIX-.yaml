    Index. Volatility has crashed and the VIX Index has broken critical technical
    support at the 12 level. Indeed, The Economist's

- en: The low volatility environment is very interesting; it is rather reminiscent
    of those moments in westerns when the cavalry captain says "I don't like it. It's
    too quiet." and immediately gets an arrow through the chest. It is possible that
    the first rate rise from a central bank (some people at the Bank of England are
    getting twitchy) may be the new displacement. Euphoria stages come to an end when
    insiders take profits. Deutsche cites this happening in farmland and Hong Kong
    property but one also has to wonder about tech stocks.

    assets are ready to dive?

- en: Another way of looking at the signals from the option market is to analyze the
    VIX/VXV ratio. The VXV ratio is the three-month forward VIX Index. The VIX/VXV
    ratio is therefore a measure of the term structure of volatility, or the market's
    expectation of how volatility will evolve over time. A ratio over 1, or inverted
    term structure, indicates that near term volatility is higher than future volatility
    and a sign of a high level of angst in the market. By contrast, a low ratio is
    a sign of market complacency.

- en: At first glance, the ratio, which is shown in the top panel, is worrying for
    the bulls. The decline in the ratio mirrors the decline in the VIX Index (bottom
    panel). Moreover, the VIX/VXV ratio recently breached the 0.84 level, which is
    at the very bottom end of its one-year historical range. These are all signs of
    excessive complacency.

    a longer time frame. While the VIX/VXV ratio has fallen, its level can hardly
    be described as at off-the-charts lows and an indication of excessive euphoria.
    Even if we were to discount the period before 2012, when VIX levels were generally
    much higher, the VIX/VXV ratio has fallen to these levels several times before
    and declined to significantly much lower levels in the past.

    the equity market outlook, I would be a little hesitant about buying at these
    stock market levels. Analysis of the Put-Call ratio, which is a contrarian indicator,
    shows that the put-call ratio has been plummeting - and that is not a bullish
    sign over the next few days.

    the signals from the term structure of volatility. That message suggests that
    while fear levels are low, they are not so low to cause alarm from a contrarian
    point of view.

    to wait for a short-term pullback as sentiment indicators like the put-call ratio
    is showing excessive bullishness. One possibly bullish trigger might be for the
    VIX to rally test the 12 resistance-turned-support level to get long.
