    outlining the various explanations for the low volatility effect,

    our biases show (we aren't in lock-step on this, note Blitz here vs. my approach
    here, which has a subtle distinction).  As most papers on the low volatility focus
    on the data, often with very different motivations, we thought a paper addressing
    these various theories would be helpful.

    of references on seminal articles in the various threads, and you should be aware
    of what the various theories argue. As Nietzsche said, if you know the why, the
    how is infinitely bearable.
