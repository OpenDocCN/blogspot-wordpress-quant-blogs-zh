    generated a fair amount of feedback, both on the comments section and by email.
    I have had a number of interesting exchanges, particularly on where I believe
    a quantitative alpha can be found.

    bottom-up equity quantitative analysis has dropped dramatically over the last
    couple of decades. As a result, the competitive advantage of using multi-factor
    bottom-up quantitative stock selection techniques has eroded considerably. We
    are all using the same databases and the same tools. Is it wonder why we wind
    up in the same crowded trade and bottom-up stock selection alpha is becoming such
    an arms race that no one can win?

    written by finance academics starting in the 1970s. Remember the low P/E anomaly?
    The P/B anomaly? Small cap and neglect effect? That research was followed by inquiries
    into earnings expectations and surprise, etc. Investment managers took many of
    those insights and implemented them in a systematic way in their portfolios. Thus
    quantitative analysis was born.

    better returns. Stocks with cheap valuations, as measured by low P/B, usually
    have something wrong with them fundamentally – a “yuck” factor. Buying them required
    an investor to hold his nose from smelling the “yuck” in the portfolio. Quantitative
    analysis gave you the discipline to buy those stocks.

    EV/EBITDA, etc. While that is a useful technique for valuing stocks from 30,000
    feet up, why not use the powerful of the computer to get much closer to the ground?

    analyst will focus on metrics like same store sales (often released monthly),
    sales per foot (what are the drivers to sales per foot?), etc. An energy analyst,
    by contrast, might focus on finding costs, lifting costs, refining margins, etc.

    analyze stocks by industry? Why use common metrics like P/E or Price to Sales
    across all industries (what is Price to Sales for a bank?), when they may not
    be relevant to that industry?

    come a long way and it is time that quants applied this kind of technology to
    investing. Does this require real work? Yes. Does this involve a major investment
    in technology and development? Yes, but where do you think competitive advantage
    comes from?

    techniques. The approach that I outlined in my [previous post](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-i-am-not-bottom-up-equity-quant.html)
    of moving toward top-down analysis is an example of this.

    on using heuristic techniques to marry the power of quantitative analysis to the
    insight of fundamental investors. That’s also a great solution.

    culture and genetic disposition of quantitative analysts. Quants will have to
    become much more market savvy. For example, I have spoke to finance academics
    and interviewed junior quantitative analyst candidates who only have no idea of
    how to execute a trade and have a foggy idea that, yes, there is a bid-ask spread.

- en: Years ago, I had a job interview with a very large asset management firm with
    assets in the hundreds of billions. Quants were compartmentalized in sub-functions.
    One group is responsible for stock selection alpha, another for sector alpha.
    Portfolio construction is the purview of a wholly different group, which is sometimes
    geographically removed from others. Portfolio implementation and trading is done
    by another. Well, you get the idea. Firms like this tended to be populated by
    quants with very impressive academic credentials. The core belief of these kinds
    of firms tended to be that if we could get smarter PhDs, we can build the next
    generation earning surprise model (or whatever model), and get a better alpha.

    that creates a form of dysfunction in the firm. People are not encouraged to see
    the big picture. You are certainly not required to be market savvy. The way you
    get to the top of these behemoths is to be better technically and play the right
    political games, just as the way you get to the top of an investment bank is to
    be the better revenue producer without an understading of the bigger issues.
