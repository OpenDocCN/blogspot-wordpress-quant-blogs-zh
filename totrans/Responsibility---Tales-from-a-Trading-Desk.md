> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/05/19/responsibility/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/05/19/responsibility/#0001-01-01)

## Responsibility

The 90‚Äôs was less [PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) on the trading floor than it is today.¬† Anyone who lived though the 90‚Äôs trading era or there abouts has been hardened, especially if you sat on a trading desk.¬† Blame [culture](http://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_we_create_a_no-blame_culture_in_the_workplace) was the norm, partly due to the alpha male characters, coupled numerous other enhancers.¬† Unfortunately in many ways society is also drive by the need to find somebody to blame üò¶¬† Which leads us to responsibility.¬† Blame is an easy way out, responsibility is more difficult.¬† There is no free lunch.

Denis Waitley offers a great [quote](http://www.sundaymag.tv/issue7/culture-of-responsibility/) to ground ones thoughts on responsibility:

> ‚ÄúA sign of wisdom and maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your decisions cause your rewards and consequences. You are responsible for your life, and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make.‚Äù

Which leads to some relevant reading on [Inc](http://www.inc.com/peter-economy/create-culture-of-responsibility.html), [BusinessInsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-can-we-build-culture-of-responsibility-2010-6) and [LostTechies](http://lostechies.com/scottreynolds/2009/01/07/creating-a-culture-of-responsibility/).
