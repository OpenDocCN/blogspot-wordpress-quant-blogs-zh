    more stringent margin requirements for leveraged ETFs in [Increased Margin Requirements
    for Leveraged Exchange-Traded Funds and Associated Uncovered Options](http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p119906.pdf).

    and now that one month has passed, I thought it might be interesting to see how
    the activity in these ETFs and their options may have been affected by the new
    margin requirements.

    not shown here, I should note that in the almost three months from my [previous
    update on September 9^(th)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/updating-triple-etf-options-landscape.html)
    to December 1^(st), four different triple ETF pairs ([UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)/[SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU),
    [TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA)/[TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA),
    [DRN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DRN)/[DRV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DRV)
    and [EDC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDC)/[EDZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDZ))
    showed substantial growth in volumes and every single pair showed some signs of
    increased interest -- so triple ETFs had significant momentum when the new margin
    rules were implemented. This time around, however, the only notable growth has
    been in the long bond pair, [TMF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TMF)
    and [TMV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TMV), which admittedly comes
    off of a very small base. Also, there are signs that the large cap pair ([BGU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGU)/[BGZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGZ))
    and the developed markets pair ([DZK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DZK)/[DPK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DPK)),
    are starting to lose traction.

    without the FINRA rules, but it is fair to say that FINRA has now stopped the
    growth momentum of triple ETFs in their tracks.

    observations, but I would be remiss in not noting that the bear ETF implied volatility
    has dropped much faster that the bull ETF implied volatility almost across the
    board.
