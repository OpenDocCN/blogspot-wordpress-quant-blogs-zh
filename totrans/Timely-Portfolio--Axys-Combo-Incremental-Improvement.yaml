    I thought my first real challenge would be to get two charts with one report. 
    In my mind, client reporting generally contains four major sections:'

    (Historical Value).  The new Excel file can be downloaded at [excelgrf_macros.xlsm](http://www.box.com/s/ay4diedl0cq9ean02c89
    "http://www.box.com/s/ay4diedl0cq9ean02c89") and our fancy new Axys report at
    [actimval.rep](http://www.box.com/s/452cky1rizy10mhvjyia).  I accept no credit
    for the code in the report since most comes from the standard Axys activity.rep
    and mval.rep.

    Axys](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/power-of-sparklines-in-advent-axys.html).

    a step in the right direction.

    the end of all this, I foresee some mighty clean and impressive report packages. 
    Please comment and contribute.  I know this is pretty domain specific, so let
    me know if you are out there.  As far as I know the only folks professionally
    pursuing Axys custom reporting besides Advent are [http://cssi.org/](http://cssi.org/
    "http://cssi.org/") and [http://www.isitc.com/](http://www.isitc.com/ "http://www.isitc.com/").
