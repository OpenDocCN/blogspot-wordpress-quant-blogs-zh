    'The Beta Revolution', which mentions 'portfolio managers and security analysts
    who mathematical backgrounds extend only slightly beyond long division are tossing
    betas around with the abandon of Ph.D.'s in statistical theory.'

    by William Sharpe and Jack Treynor in 1963 and 65\. By 1968, they note 253 articles
    and 89 books written about 'beta' (really, the Capital Asset Pricing Theory).

    scatter plot, with beta on the x-axis, returns on the y-axis, would have been
    nice. In fact, the first empirical support wasn't even until a couple years later,
    meaning, there was no data supporting the theory at this time, but the experts
    all believed the theory anyway. The subsequent supporting data was weak and contained
    a serious omitted variables bias, namely, that size explained any correlation
    between beta and average returns. All the hubbub was purely from theorists, without
    even any flawed empirical support. One can see why the initial flawed empirical
    research got through, because all the experts knew the right answer, and so didn't
    think to test the theory with appropriate skepticism.

- en: Yet even then, the article notes that 'very low beta stocks, in fact, tend to
    have higher alphas and high beta stocks tend to have low alphas.' That is, the
    beta-return relationship, to the extent it did exist in unpublished studies, was
    pretty flat. A fund manager back in 1971 could have jumped on that small insight
    and blown away everyone over the next generation, but that little nugget was ignored.

- en: The description of beta is distressingly vague, but the intuition they mention
    is based, in their words, on two 'widely accepted ideas.' First, that to obtain
    higher rewards, one must take higher risks. Secondly, that individual stock returns
    are correlated with the market as a whole. Interestingly, it is true that given
    standard utility functions (eg, u(x)=-exp(-ax), these do lead to beta-type risk
    premiums. Something's clearly wrong, and while most researchers seem to think
    it's schizophrenic risk-loving (within asset classes, not between them), I think
    it has to be we are more envious than greedy.
