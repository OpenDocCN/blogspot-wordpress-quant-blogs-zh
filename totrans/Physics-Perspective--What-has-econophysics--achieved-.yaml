    from physics to problems in finance and economics -- tends to be quite controversial.
    Many economists in particular seem to find it fairly annoying, although quite
    a few others either work in the area or do work that is closely associated in
    conceptual terms. Physicists in the area have been criticized on various occasions
    for being ignorant of prior work in economics (sometimes true), of using less
    than rigorous statistics (I haven't seen anything convincing on this) and of employing
    unrealistic models.

    Out of politeness, and to avoid boring anyone, I won''t make a list. But physicists

    less likely in simple inverse proportion to the time after the main shock). Such

    mostly in collaboration with economists. In the mid-1990s, researchers at the
    Santa Fe Institute first demonstrated how fat-tailed dynamics could arise naturally
    in models representing a market as an ecology of interacting adaptive agents.
    Models of this kind have since become widespread and used to perform some of the
    most sophisticated tests of policy proposals -- for the idea of a financial transactions
    tax, for example, as currently planned by the European Commission. For this, econophysics
    deserves some credit. For a nice review, see

- en: 4\. Work in econophysics -- through the study of minimal models such as the
    minority game -- has also revealed surprising qualitative features of markets;
    for example, that a key determinant of market dynamics is the diversity of participants'
    strategic behaviour. Markets work fairly smoothly if participants act using many
    diverse strategies, but break down if many traders chase few opportunities and
    use similar strategies to do so. Strategic crowding of this kind can cause an
    abrupt phase transition from smooth behaviour into a regime prone to sharp, virtually
    discontinuous price movements.
