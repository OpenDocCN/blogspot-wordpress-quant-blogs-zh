    We have seen no major European conflict since 1945, the end of the Second World
    War. The formation of the European Union has kept the peace. The political elite
    of Europe, despite all the bickering, are still committed to that bigger than
    life myth of the formation of the EU.

    of binding Germany and France together so that another major war cannot happen
    again, they are held back by Europe`s sense of Volk. That seems to be underlying
    reason for the failings of the euro - economic union without political union.

    It was made a week after the attack on Parliament. In it, a York University student
    named Omar Albach and two friends set out to gauge people’s attitudes toward Muslims.
    They took their experiment to the streets of Hamilton, on the eve of Cpl. Cirillo’s
    funeral, where emotions were running high. One friend was dressed in a traditional
    Muslim robe; the other played an Islamophobic bigot. They wanted to see whose
    side people would take.

    vandalized. People arrived for Friday prayers to discover that someone had thrown
    a brick through a window and sprayed the words “GO HOME” across the front of the
    building.

    scrub brushes, paint remover and flowers. They made new signs with Canadian flags
    saying “You are home.” Local contractors showed up, along with soldiers in uniform
    from the nearby military base. Ajaz Quraishi, president of the Islamic Society
    of Cold Lake, said he didn’t think the incident had anything to do with hostility
    in the community. “Maybe kids did it, I don’t know who did it, but it could happen
    to anybody,” he [told](http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Cold+Lake+responds+after+mosque+spray+painted+with+words+Home/10321681/story.html)
    the Edmonton Journal. “… One guy came up and said, ‘You know, I’m a redneck, but
    I don’t like this.’ He came and hugged me.”

    the centrifugal forces of localized identities. Another challenge has been the
    flood of immigrants and refugees from North Africa, whose Muslim identities rub
    the locals the wrong way. Yet, even at the nadir of the Scottish Referendum when
    it appeared that Scotland might succeed from the UK, the centripetal of Europe
    held together as Scotland showed that it wanted to be part of the EU and acknowledged
    its European identity.
