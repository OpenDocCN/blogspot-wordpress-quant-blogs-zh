    is very real and long-lasting (see [Everything you need to know about the Great
    Rotation but were afraid to ask](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-great-rotation-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)).
    That should be bullish for the S&P 500, right?

- en: Despite the cyclical and reflationary tailwinds for stocks, the S&P 500 has
    a weighting problem. About 44% of its weight is concentrated in Big Tech (technology,
    communication services, and Amazon). The top five sectors comprise nearly 70%
    of index weight, and it would be difficult for the index to meaningfully advance
    without the participation of a majority of these sectors. However, an analysis
    of the relative performance of the top five sectors does not exactly inspire confidence
    as to the sustainability of an advance. Technology relative strength, which is
    the biggest sector, is rolling over. Healthcare is weak. Neither consumer discretionary
    nor communication services are showing any signs of leadership. Only financial
    stocks, which represent the smallest of the top five sectors, is exhibiting some
    emerging relative strength.
