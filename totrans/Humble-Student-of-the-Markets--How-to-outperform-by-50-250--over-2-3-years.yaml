- en: Investors are increasingly convinced that the cyclical and Great Rotation trade
    is very real and long-lasting (see [Everything you need to know about the Great
    Rotation but were afraid to ask](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-great-rotation-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)).
    That should be bullish for the S&P 500, right?

  zh: 投资者越来越确信，周期性和大轮动交易是真实且长期存在的（参见[你所需知道的一切关于大轮动，但一直不敢问的内容](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-great-rotation-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)）。这对标普500来说应该是利好的，对吧？

- en: Despite the cyclical and reflationary tailwinds for stocks, the S&P 500 has
    a weighting problem. About 44% of its weight is concentrated in Big Tech (technology,
    communication services, and Amazon). The top five sectors comprise nearly 70%
    of index weight, and it would be difficult for the index to meaningfully advance
    without the participation of a majority of these sectors. However, an analysis
    of the relative performance of the top five sectors does not exactly inspire confidence
    as to the sustainability of an advance. Technology relative strength, which is
    the biggest sector, is rolling over. Healthcare is weak. Neither consumer discretionary
    nor communication services are showing any signs of leadership. Only financial
    stocks, which represent the smallest of the top five sectors, is exhibiting some
    emerging relative strength.

  zh: 尽管对股票有周期性和再通胀的顺风，但标普500存在权重问题。其大约44%的权重集中在大型科技股（科技、通信服务和亚马逊）上。前五大行业几乎占据了指数权重的70%，如果没有这些行业的大部分参与，指数很难实质性上涨。然而，对前五大行业的相对表现分析并没有让人对上涨的可持续性充满信心。作为最大行业的科技股的相对强度正在减弱。医疗保健股表现疲弱。
    neither 消费者可选股 nor 通信服务股显示出任何领导迹象。只有金融股，作为前五大行业中规模最小的行业，显示出一些相对强度。
