- en: After the SPX tested all-time highs on Wednesday, it was not surprising to see
    the major US stock market averages pull back on Thursday. The decline was surprisingly
    light. What I found supportive of the bull case was the upside breakouts shown
    by the high-beta leadership such as the NASDAQ and small caps.

- en: Consider, for example, the chart below of the NASDAQ 100\. Not only did the
    upside breakout hold, the index went on to further new highs on Thursday. However,
    these upside breakouts were staged on falling volume, which suggests that a near-term
    pullback may be necessary before stock prices move to sustainable new highs.

    further breakouts on Thursday, but on low volume.

    compared to the broad market, indicating that Mr. Market still believes that economic
    growth is undergoing a period of acceleration.

    after option expiry has tended to have a negative bias for the market. The current
    market action is highly suggestive of a minor pullback next week.

    of a bear case for equities. If the forecast weakness were to occur next week,
    I would closely watch sentiment model readings for direction.

- en: correctly pointed out that sentiment models showing a crowded long reading.
    If bullishness were to pull back with prices, then I would see that as a green
    light to go long. On the other hand, if the level of bullishness were to stay
    stubbornly high, then it would be a warning that an intermediate term market top
    may be in place.
