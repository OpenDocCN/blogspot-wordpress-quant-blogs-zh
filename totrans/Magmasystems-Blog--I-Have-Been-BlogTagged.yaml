- en: 1) In high school, I played in a Progressive Rock copy band called Heresy. We
    performed songs by Gentle Giant, King Crimson, ELP, and others. The keyboard player
    was a rich kid from Baldwin, Long Island, who had every keyboard ever made.

    to the old Sunnyside Gardens in Queens, and take photos of wrestlers like Pedro
    Morales, Chief Jay Strongbow, Haystacks Calhoun, etc. I was also a writer for
    a little wrestling newsletter put out by a guy named David Meltzer ... now Meltzer
    is probably the best known journalist in pro wrestling.

    Lynch, and presided over Merrill in the go-go 90's. My father and Dave worked
    together in the Forest Hills branch of Merrill Lynch in the 70's, and Dave was
    part of my dad's pinochle group. So, every few weeks, Dave would come over to
    our apartment for the big pinochle game.
