    (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold
    extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive
    real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email
    alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/).
    The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that
    began in March 2016 is shown below.
