    I talked about the fact Custom Connect doesn’t seem to have an Ofcom license there, and
    about the rumors saying they may have installed illegal dishes on this tower (illegal
    means: without planning permit, or before the permit was granted). I decided to dig
    more about the planning applications concerning this tower. Sometimes the devil
    is in the detail. There are four HFT players on this tower (Custom Connect, Optiver,
    McKay Brothers and Latent Networks), and they all have submitted permits.'

    Optiver (submission in October 2013, authorization granted in December 2013).
    By checking all the documents, I found this [comment](http://pa.midkent.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZVS2KJTA178) (the eighth
    document), made by a neighbor: “*There are already 2 Dishes installed on the Mast
    and have been there for awhile now so I’m presuming that this is what the application
    is now for!*” How interesting! Before the first HFT player arrived in Dunkirk,
    there were two dishes on the tower (put before October 2013). Those of Custom
    Connect? I don’t think Optiver would have installed their dishes before authorization,
    they seem to be very very careful.'

    planning application was the McKay one (submission and authorization in November

    one was by Custom Connect (submission in December 2013, authorization granted

    the Latent Networks one (submission in January 2014, authorization granted in March
    2014). The same neighbor who talked about the two dishes “*already* *installed*”
    made this comment: “*Is there a limit on the number of dishes and small buildings
    on this site as we have I believe we currently 4 applications some already passed.
    Just concerned that if there is not a plan the site will be a mess.*” This neighbor is
    well informed: there are four applications, all submitted by HFT players. That’s
    interesting because you can read the same statements in other applications, everywhere
    in the UK – people asking why, suddenly, some old towers are invaded by new dishes.
    It’s HFT, stupid! (Sorry… I don’t want to insult this lady.)'

    by Latent): “*Dunkirk Parish Council object to this application. The Council are
    concerned about the number of applications regularly being received for dishes
    on the mast and the cumulative affect that this may have. The health and safety
    risks of installing such equipment is not referred to in the supporting documents.
    The Council are also concerned that there is no certainty to the limit of future
    similar applications which may be received. **The applications are each made by
    different telecommunication companies via different agents and there doesn’t appear
    to be any central control by the owner of the site as to what is installed on
    the mast and in the site buildings**. Despite requests in the past the owner has
    not provided details of the programme of work, maintenance of the mast and site,
    and safety certificates in place. Again, there doesn’t appear to be anyone managing
    these aspects at the site. Dunkirk Parish Council feel that the committee should
    be aware of these concerns when making their decision. Louise Blackshaw Clerk
    to the Council*” **Bold** is mine, as I already read the same statements in other
    planning applications. Sometimes authorities don’t understand who really is behind
    the permits. I don’t know why…'

- en: 'Let’s have a new look at the Custom Connect application. Words are important.
    Very important here, as the heading of the planning application is: “*Retrospective
    consent for two 1.2m microwave dishes installed at a height of 40m on the existing
    110m tower, associated cabling and the installation of a small equipment cabin
    at ground level*”. Yes, you read correctly. “***Retrospective consent***” [means](http://www.e-m.uk.com/frequently-asked-questions-co-4):
    the dishes were installed before the authorization was granted. Rumors were facts:
    Custom Connect pirated the tower by installing their dishes prior to any authorization. Bad
    boys… (but we don’t know if the two dishes the neighbor talks about were the Custom
    Connect ones, or others).'

    19, 2013\. The same neighbor who complained about the two dishes “*already installed*”
    also wrote: “*As we are having so many applications for dishes to be put on the
    mast which also entails building various cabins can it be confirmed that there
    is a limit on how many the mast can accommodate. Also what size are these buildings
    going to be ? **I would also like to add that one of the applicants has already
    cut down some of the trees on the Public Road opposite my property NO 26 Courtenay
    Road**.*” What? Someone cut down trees? It’s bad. No respect for the environment. Microwaves
    require line of sight from one tower to the next but we can’t really know who
    cut down the trees – some HFT player, or someone else? Optiver was the first firm
    to have authorizations to put dishes on the tower, and I doubt they cut them between
    December 9 (when they received authorizations) and December 19 (when the neighbor
    did this comment). When the trees were cut down? The neighbor thinks it’s “*one
    of the applicants*” and the only recent applicant names you can find on the Swale
    Borough Council for the Dunkirk tower are some HFT operators. But we’ll never
    know if the chainsaw was the one of the pirates…'
