    [Money Mavericks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Mavericks-Confessions-Manager-Financial/dp/027373198X)
    he describes executing his first trade after launching his hedge fund, Holte Capital
    in late 2002\. It’s a $50K equity buy order, and his broker says “you do know
    this is only a 50 grand order, right ?” The broker goes on to suggest that his
    seniors won’t be happy with him handling such small orders. Lars finds the experience
    dispiriting, and starts to use his prime broker’s “cheap and electronic direct
    market access platforms” to execute.
