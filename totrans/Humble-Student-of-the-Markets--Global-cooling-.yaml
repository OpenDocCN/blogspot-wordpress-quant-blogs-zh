    Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and downloaded 156 megaybytes of data including extremely

    about Global Warming is that the Earth is undergoing a warming period caused by
    the effects of industrialization. However, there is another view that global warming
    is caused by solar activity – sunspots and solar winds.

    cycles have been associated with cooling periods such as the Little Ice Age experienced
    a few hundred years ago. Indeed, there have been reports that there is more ice
    in the Arctic (yes – it’s only one data point) and there has been some hand wringing
    among the scientists about the timing of the solar cycle.

    for the possibility that it is a valid one and should the Earth enter a cooling
    period, this would be bullish for energy demand and result in higher energy prices.
