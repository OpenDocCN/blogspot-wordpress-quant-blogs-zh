    Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and downloaded 156 megaybytes of data including extremely
    damaging emails, we now know that data supporting the global warming thesis was
    completely fabricated.

    about Global Warming is that the Earth is undergoing a warming period caused by
    the effects of industrialization. However, there is another view that global warming
    is caused by solar activity – sunspots and solar winds.

    cycles have been associated with cooling periods such as the Little Ice Age experienced
    a few hundred years ago. Indeed, there have been reports that there is more ice
    in the Arctic (yes – it’s only one data point) and there has been some hand wringing
    among the scientists about the timing of the solar cycle.

    for the possibility that it is a valid one and should the Earth enter a cooling
    period, this would be bullish for energy demand and result in higher energy prices.
