# Xi (Rossi) LUO: Statisticians Compute Fast

> 来源：[http://rossiluo.blogspot.com/2012/03/statisticians-can-compute-fast.html#0001-01-01](http://rossiluo.blogspot.com/2012/03/statisticians-can-compute-fast.html#0001-01-01)

Fast computation is increasingly important in analyzing data as we are living in an information explosion era.  Here is another paper we submitted and the preprint is on

[arXiv 1203:3896](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3896).  An example in the paper is to compute the brain networks of ADHD children and controls.  Here is a snap shot of the computation time.

The new method is called SCIO.  Will post the R package on CRAN.
