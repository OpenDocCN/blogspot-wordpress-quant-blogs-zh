    looked like Belfort took Silva down, he climbed out from underneath using a freakish
    flurry of athleticism, then got up and delivered a straight kick (below) to Belfort's
    right cheek that basically ended it. Strangely, Steven Seagal was in Silva's corner,

- en: While ESPN and Sports Illustrated continue to emphasize boxing, all the excitement
    in combat sports is in mixed martial arts. After all, in a real fight takedowns,
    kicks, and chokes happen, so boxing seem pretty lame in comparison. A fight without
    take downs is like Greco compared to freestyle wrestling, not very impressive
    because you are constraining so many real options.

    because these guys all figure they can lose a ton and feel normal within 24 hours,
    which actually works well as long as you don't cross that line into permanent
    renal failure. It's a very nonlinear result, and I suspect athletes will be tempted
    to push until someone gets seriously hurt. It's a dangerous game. American wrestler
