    of the lessons that were learned in running the Complex Event Processing group
    at Citi. I have some pretty strong opinions about the state of commercial CEP

    a little while with the constant twiddling and refactoring of my Facebook Notifier.
    My son tells me that I can make a fortune by selling it, as it seems to be something
    that is badly needed by PC users. But, with my new job, I will not have any time
    to enhance it and support it. I ran a software company for 10 years, and I don't
    know if I will ever be releasing another piece of commercial software again. Just
    too much hassle right now.
