    destroyed via the housing price decline, and this represented only a couple percent
    in the stock market. The implication was the market had already overreacted. The
    consensus was this was correct, and I must admit I was no different.

  zh: 关于房地产泡沫发表了演讲，并指出房价下跌已经摧毁了价值约2000亿美元，而这只代表了股票市场中的几个百分点。这暗示着市场已经做出了过度反应。共识是这是正确的，我必须承认我也是如此。
- en: I think what is most surprising about this is the accelerator mechanism that
    propelled a housing bubble into so many other sectors. It destroyed the market
    value of all sorts of assets, and seems caught in a positive feedback loop. A
    related puzzle is that the crisis seemed to start in the US, but the US equity
    market has declined less than most other countries, and our currency has strengthened.

    I know many thoughtful people missed it too, and that very few crises are understood
    in real time. Sure, with hindsight, I'm seeing connections, how a total lack in
    trust has created declines in market values which cause declines in banks that
    have to mark more and more of their assets to market, but realistically going
    back to last year I don't see how I could have anticipated this other than being
    a permabear, or knowing about the prevalence of NINJA loans. Indeed, maybe that
    is the missing variable, that one could not have predicted this problem without
    knowing how crazy mortgage underwriting became.

  zh: 去年夏天。我并不感到因为我没有理解或者预料到这场危机而感到难过，因为我知道很多深思熟虑的人们也错过了，几乎没有一场危机是在实时理解的。当然，有了后见之明，我看到了联系，全面的信任缺失如何导致市场价值下降，导致银行资产的标记更多。但是回到去年时，实际上我觉得我没有办法预料到这一点，除非成为一位永久的熊市人士，或者知道NINJA贷款的普遍。的确，也许那就是缺失的变量，也就是说，你如果不了解抵押贷款核准变得多么疯狂，你是无法预测到这个问题的。
