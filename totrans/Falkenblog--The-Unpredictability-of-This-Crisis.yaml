    it. For example, in a Blogginheads episode,

    were becoming apparent, I was at a meeting by the National Bureau of Economic
    Research, where all the top financial economists got together.'

    destroyed via the housing price decline, and this represented only a couple percent
    in the stock market. The implication was the market had already overreacted. The
    consensus was this was correct, and I must admit I was no different.

    propelled a housing bubble into so many other sectors. It destroyed the market
    value of all sorts of assets, and seems caught in a positive feedback loop. A
    related puzzle is that the crisis seemed to start in the US, but the US equity
    market has declined less than most other countries, and our currency has strengthened.

    I know many thoughtful people missed it too, and that very few crises are understood
    in real time. Sure, with hindsight, I'm seeing connections, how a total lack in
    trust has created declines in market values which cause declines in banks that
    have to mark more and more of their assets to market, but realistically going
    back to last year I don't see how I could have anticipated this other than being
    a permabear, or knowing about the prevalence of NINJA loans. Indeed, maybe that
    is the missing variable, that one could not have predicted this problem without
    knowing how crazy mortgage underwriting became.
