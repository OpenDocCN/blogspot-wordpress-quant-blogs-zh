- en: So it is  the 1-year anniversary of this blog  and I guess its a good time to
    do a quick speech to explain how I got here and to thank certain people for getting
    me to this point. Somehow I find myself  popular  as  a “quant”, a consultant,
    and even more strangely for my technical indicators. Truthfully my background
    prior to CSS was not rooted firmly in either area. Readers know that I have a
    primary background  in doing research on company fundamentals and stock scoring.
    I ran several complex studies with professors over a series of years and toiled
    in relative obscurity. I also spent many years as a professional poker player.
     In fact, I am always proud to say that just over 1-year ago, I actually did not
    know much if anything about technical analysis (of course this often frightens
    the odd client!). Furthermore, despite my finance background, I would still not
    consider myself a serious “quant”—- I can’t remember the last time I did a matrix
    or an integral, and certainly don’t pride myself on mathematical proofs.  Thankfully
    for me we live in the age of computers and statistical software.

    from a completely different perspective than before. Truthfully, many other bloggers
    helped to inspire and shape my thinking (see Blogroll).  Apparently I have taught
    many readers some new ways of looking at things in the course of my own studies
    and observations on the market. I wasn’t aware that my thinking was so unconventional
    until I was told otherwise!  I have readers to thank for both their support and
    their excellent questions.

- en: If one man is to be singled out for introducing CSS to the blogosphere it is
    Michael Stokes of **MarketSci** [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)
    . Being a new reader of his blog, I spent time digesting his good work and commenting
    on several posts. It was my first introduction to the world of technical analysis,
    market timing, and adaptation. One day while on vacation, I decided to send in
    an idea I had with the view that it may be interesting to readers. Michael took
    a spreadsheet I sent him on a formula for an indicator to predict the S&P500 and
    introduced it to the world as the “DV2.” Lest some of you think that my habit
    of naming indicators beginning with my initials (DV) is an  ego-driven narcissistic
    quirk, you can all blame Michael for starting the trend—truthfully I always referred
    to the DV2 internally as the “pivot indicator.” Then in another strange twist,
    a fellow (and now good friend) by the name of Jeff Pietsch put DV2 and many other
    indicators to follow on his very popular **ETF Rewind** tool   [http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/](http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/)
    .  Jeff went on to help with programming and launching both DV Indicators for
    Tradestation and Amibroker and the wonderful new Excel Plug-In. He also helped
    me develop my thinking in many different ways. As my posts on the blog started
    to pile up, I had plenty of supporters that helped to generate a fan base early
    on–the earliest was Rob Hanna of **Quantifiable Edges** [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)
    , followed by   Jared Woodward of **Condor Options** [http://www.condoroptions.com/](http://www.condoroptions.com/),
    Charles Kirk of the [**Kirk Report** http://www.thekirkreport.com/](http://www.thekirkreport.com/)
    , Tadas Viksantas of **Abnormal Returns** [http://abnormalreturns.com/](http://abnormalreturns.com/),
    and Brett Steenbarger of **Traderfeed** [http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/).
    Many others in the blogosphere deserve mention- but I would run out of space very
    quickly in trying to avoid picking out just a few.

- en: Lastly, and most importantly, a fellow by the name of Corey Rittenhouse of **Catallactic
    Analysis** [http://catallacticanalysis.com/](http://catallacticanalysis.com/)
    sent me a backtest one day early on in the year based on one of the first of many
    crazy ideas. Corey became my primary partner in testing and research, and without
    him none of this would be even possible. Corey is a magician with the computer
    and without his help  I would still be stuck putting up ugly black and white tables
    (whenever you see that on the blog thats me!). There would be no Adaptive Time
    Machine, Livermore Index, or pretty looking backtest pictures–all of this was
    done in VBA with custom code much to most people’s amazement.
