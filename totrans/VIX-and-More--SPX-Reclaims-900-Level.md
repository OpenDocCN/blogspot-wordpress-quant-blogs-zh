# VIX and More: SPX Reclaims 900 Level

The S&P 500 index has not traded above the 900 level since the beginning of January, but just edged above that number a moment ago.

In spite of all the recent bullishness in stocks, my evaluation of the risk/reward ratio of the markets has me positioned with a bearish bias at the the moment.
