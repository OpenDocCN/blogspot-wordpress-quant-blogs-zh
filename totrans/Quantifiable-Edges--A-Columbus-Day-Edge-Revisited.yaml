    and the bond market are closed.  In past years with the bond market closed, the
    stock market has done quite well on Columbus Day.  Of course the most famous Columbus
    Day rally was in 2008 when the market gained over 11% after having crashed the
    week before.  Last year in the 10/10/11 blog I showed that positive momentum leading
    up to Columbus Day has generally led to a positive Columbus Day.  Columbus Day
    has been celebrated on the 2nd Monday of October since 1971\.  Below is an updated
    version of last year’s study.

    and winners twice the size of losers risk/reward has been very favorable.
