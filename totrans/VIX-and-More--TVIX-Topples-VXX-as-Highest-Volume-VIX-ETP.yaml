    (VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN) is going to dethrone [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    as the most heavily traded [VIX exchange-traded product](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    (ETP), with TVIX trading 29 million shares and VXX at 25 million.

    at the end of January has reigned supreme in volume and assets since the first
    week it was launched. TVIX has a long way to go before it matches VXX in terms
    of assets, but the gap is narrowing quickly.

    many who are new to the TVIX party do not understand the nuances or even the basics
    of this product – so it looks like another round of education is in order.

    overtaken Barclays/iPath as the #1 provider of VIX-based ETPs in terms of volume.
    It will be interesting to see how Barclays addresses this in terms of future products.'
