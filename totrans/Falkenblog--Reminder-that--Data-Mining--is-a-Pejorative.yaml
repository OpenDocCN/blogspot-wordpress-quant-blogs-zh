- en: The stock market generates such vast quantities of information that, if you
    plow through enough of it for long enough, you can always find some relationship
    that appears to generate spectacular returns -- by coincidence alone. This sham
    is known as "data mining."

- en: Mr. Leinweber got so frustrated by "irresponsible" data mining that he decided
    to satirize it. After casting about to find a statistic so absurd that no sensible
    person could possibly believe it could forecast U.S. stock prices, Mr. Leinweber
    settled on annual butter production in Bangladesh. Over an 13-year period, he
    found, this statistic "explained" 75% of the variation in the annual returns of
    the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.

- en: By tossing in U.S. cheese production and the total population of sheep in both
    Bangladesh and the U.S., Mr. Leinweber was able to "predict" past U.S. stock returns
    with 99% accuracy.
