    law. If two cubes are made of the same material then they will have the same density.
    Yet since the two cubes have different area to volume ratios they will likewise
    have different stress at the base of each cube. If too much stress is placed on
    an object then it will fail, or in this case a large cube has a much greater possibility
    of collapsing. This is why sandcastles can only be a few feet high.'

    as animals get bigger, which is why rhinos and elephants are pretty thick. Bones
    comprise about 8% of the weight of a mouse, 14% of a goose or dog, and 18% of
    a man.

- en: Also because of the Square-Cube Law, larger animals have less relative muscle
    strength than smaller animals. Both the muscle strength and bone strength are
    functions of the cross sectional area, while the weight of the animal is a function
    of volume. It is because of relative muscle strength that an ant can lift fifty
    times its weight while a human can lift an amount equal to its own weight, and
    an Asian elephant can only lift 25% of its own weight. The greater muscle to weight
    ratio of smaller animals is what allows them to jump higher than several times
    their own height, while at the other extreme an elephant can not even jump.

    Comparing a raccoon with a horse femur, he found the horse femur should be 6 times
    thicker than a raccoon's. It turned out 5 times thicker, which is close. Then
    he compared a horse to a mouse, and the thickness was only 70 times thicker, not
    the 250 times thicker as predicted by their lengths. The elephant femur was only
    120 times thicker than a mouse's femur, not the 1000 times as predicted.

    So, Galileo's square-cube 'law' is really an approximation for the moderate spectrum
    of animal sizes, something that explains a lot but doesn't generalize like gravitation,
    which Newton used to explain the fall of an apple and the orbit of the moon.

    to clumping or spinning. The idea that the space is suffused with unobservable
    dark matter fixes this problem, but it's a fudge, because it 'appears' only as
    a solution to this problem. Perhaps gravitation doesn't scale at that dimension.
