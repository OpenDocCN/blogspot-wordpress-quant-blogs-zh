    then asked whether the protesters violated a law that that prohibits intentionally
    interfering with, obstructing, intimidating, or threatening a person seeking to
    enter, exit, or remain lawfully on the premises. There were actually two videos,
    identical except that the designers of the study altered the videos to change
    what was being protested. One video is edited so that the protest seems against
    military recruiters for violating gay rights; the second video is edited so that
    the protest is against an abortion clinic.

    by a factor of two or three, our minds jump to discrimination as the explanation,”
    said Dr. Haidt, who called himself a longtime liberal turned centrist. “But when
    we find out that conservatives are underrepresented among us by a factor of more
    than 100, suddenly everyone finds it quite easy to generate alternate explanations."
