    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model
    signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish
    Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history
    of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown
    by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    when the NAAIM fell below its Bollinger Band (blue vertical line) have been good
    trading buy signals. While oversold markets can become more oversold, buy signals
    have marked periods of low downside risk. On the other hand, sell signals when
    NAAIM rose above its upper BB have not worked well.

    timer I monitor told me that during the market’s blow-off stage between last November
    and the late-January peak, he lost 18% of his subscribers. He added that he’d
    never before experienced a drop in subscribers of similar magnitude — much less
    over so short a period.

    Ignore "this will not end well" warnings with no obvious bearish trigger. Don't
