    But there are occasional exceptions that are almost interesting, like IEX’s new
    [fee](https://www.iextrading.com/docs/rule-filings/SR-IEX-2017-27.pdf). In essence,
    the new fee will charge liquidity takers an extra 30 mils if the “Crumbling Quote
    Indicator” is on at the time IEX completes an execution. [[1](#bottom1iexpricing)][[2](#bottom2iexpricing)]
    Most exchanges segment order flow with incentives; IEX is attempting to carve
    out a niche by using disincentives.

    the peculiarility of an exchange penalizing trades at prices that are “soon to
    be stale,” a phrase that borders on oxymoron. Volume and price-changes are inseparable
    in a healthy market: traders buy when they think the price is about to increase,
    and prices tend to increase after buyers initiate trades. These processes are
    natural features of markets, and ordinarily can be prevented only via transaction-blocking
    price controls. So I find IEX’s [goal](https://www.iextrading.com/docs/The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Crumbling%20Quote%20Signal.pdf)
    of “[p]reventing someone from *anticipating* an NBBO change” a very odd one.'

    fee. Stockland says that the fee is targeted at “predatory” HFT strategies [[3](#bottom3iexpricing)],
    and designed to help other HFT strategies. An exchange is free to make a good-faith
    judgment about what types of HFT they want to encourage or discourage, but IEX
    continues to use emotionally-charged language. I hope that their feelings were
    not a factor in their determination.

    on IEX, then the mix of traders paying the fee will likely change. I strongly
    suspect that the Thor router, as described in “[Flash Boys](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/flash-boys-michael-lewis.html),”
    would pay this fee on most of its eligible orders. If Thor swept Nasdaq’s book,
    it’s very likely that IEX would determine that the quote is “crumbling” by the
    time Thor’s order exited the IEX speedbump. Thor seems to be designed for click-traders,
    so it could delay sending its orders to Nasdaq and Bats by an additional 350us,
    preventing IEX from realizing the quote is about to “crumble” until after its
    execution. But many smart order routers and execution algos trade during periods
    of market activity, and cannot delay their orders without experiencing slippage.

    they will need to convince issuers that they can realistically facilitate price
    discovery. To be frank, the current level of pre-trade transparency on IEX is
    an embarrassment and any issuer choosing to list there is taking a serious risk.
    I suspect IEX knows this and the new fee schedule is an genuine attempt to incentivize
    displayed quoting.

    Another possible purpose of the new fee is to increase support for a reduced access
    fee cap. The fee and any copycats may annoy market participants that are currently
    indifferent to the access fee cap. Reducing the [current cap](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.610)

    IEX’s claim is true, would be to improve their displayed market share. I’m a bit
    skeptical: I suspect that IEX struggles with displayed liquidity because their
    last-look-functionality allows dark orders to preferentially trade with low-alpha
    aggressors, leaving abnormally high-alpha flow to hit their lit quotes.'

- en: The new fee depends on the state of the market after an order is sent. If the
    access fee cap were higher, this would enable pricing that is economically equivalent
    to last look. But even with the current cap, there are some weird possibilities.
    If this fee is allowed, would there be anything stopping an exchange from levying
    a fee that depends on the market a millisecond in the future? What about a second?
    Or a day? An exchange could, for instance, charge 30mils extra if a trade is followed
    by a favorable price movement larger than 0.1%. With the revenue generated, it
    could pay a huge rebate to resting orders that are blown-through (by say, 1%)
    during volatile moments, compensating market makers for their losses. This could
    make the exchange’s order book thicker during high-volume periods, resulting in
    market share gains. It’s easy to see how such pricing could backfire, with the
    exchange having to make larger-than-expected payments if a tail-event occurs on
    the thickened book. And there is something uncomfortable about paying traders
    for being wrong. But it’s an intriguing possibility that issuers might like.

    predictions and penalizing noise-traders. Most likely, noise traders would move
    to other venues, leaving only orders that are sent by confident participants.
    This would add another tier to the venue segmentation spectrum. Under the current
    regime, low-alpha flow is disproportionately directed to internalizers and wholesalers,
    forcing high-alpha traders to interact with each other on lit exchanges, the centers
    of price discovery. Perhaps a few ultra-high-alpha traders would be attracted
    to this new type of venue of last resort, particularly when prices are in transition.
    I doubt it’d be wise for a major exchange to introduce this type of pseudo-[sin-tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_tax),
    but perhaps a smaller venue like PSX or EdgeA will try it out.

    the consequences of this type of pricing. IEX’s proposal shows that they are starting
    to think like their competitors do, and they’ve spun it in a way that no other
    exchange could. It may not be to the liking of long-term traders, but there’s
    no doubt that IEX is gradually becoming more sophisticated. [[6](#bottom6iexpricing)]
