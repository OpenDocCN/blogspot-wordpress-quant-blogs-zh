    the end that batching eliminates the HFT arms race, both because it reduces the
    value of tiny speed advantages and because it transforms competition on speed
    into competition on price. I think that solution is interesting, but would prefer
    the following

    from 0 to 20 milliseconds). Thus, if you know you are getting randomized, the
    marginal value of 1 millisecond is much smaller to the innovator, your place in
    the queue is noisy.

    orders exist for at least 1 second. That would get rid of a lot of flash quotes
    that are trying to be too clever and simply clog the bandwidth.

    way to increase welfare, an exchange that adds any such rule would generate more
    traffic, and ultimately, imitation. Yet, that''s how paying for liquidity provision
    (passive quotes) originated, as well as a bunch of other tactics. One thinks they
    are annoying features created in a smoke-filled room, but instead they were simply
    the result of giving market participants what they want. A retail trader can always
    opt-out by simply trading at the Volume-Weighted-Average Price (VWAP), because
    that gives you the average daily price that averages out all these shenanigans,
    so I really don''t have any sympathy for those who are bothered by it: if you
    don''t like the intraday game, don''t play it!'

    who think discrete auctions are better than continuous ones. I think they are
    not very good, and a simple example is an extreme of this, one can look at the
    performance of closing vs. opening prices. One is at the end of continuous trading,
    one where there's no trading. What happens?

    low-priced stocks.   The Open-Open returns have slightly higher volatility (2%
    higher), but more importantly, there's a lot more 'mean reversion'.  The graph
    below shows the future returns(O-O or C-C), sorted each day into deciles by the
    immediate prior return (O-O or C-C, respectively), then averaged over all those
    days.

    makers to pocket nice premiums for these temporary imbalances (you can't make
    money off this if you aren't a specialist).  Continuous trading takes such trades
    away from monopolists, and allows competition to work.
