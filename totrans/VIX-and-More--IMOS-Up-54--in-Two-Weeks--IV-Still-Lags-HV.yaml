    is up 54% in two weeks and slightly less than that in the 12 days since I mentioned
    the stock in [IMOS Breaks Out, But Implied Volatility Fails to React](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/imos-breaking-out-but-implied.html).

- en: While the company did report earnings last Friday, the stock did not appear
    to have an immediate reaction to that report. After trading in a wide range on
    Friday, the stock closed up 1.5%. Yesterday, however, it was off to the races
    again, with the stock up another 14%.

- en: Part of what makes IMOS intriguing is the paucity of public information associated
    with this Taiwan-based company. As a result, the stock is highly responsive to
    technical factors and also has a high emotional component associated with the
    price action.

- en: The last time around I posted about IMOS largely because I thought it was interesting
    that a stock which was breaking out ahead of earnings had such low [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (red IV 30 line) in spite of the fact that IMOS was now apparently “in play” at
    least in the minds of some investors. I commented at the time that “the current
    HV 20 of 91 is a better estimate of future volatility than the current IV 30 of
    62.”

    the one month chart below, once can see that IV 30 has risen to 75, even after
    accounting for the 10% decline following the earnings announcement. With [historical
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (blue HV20 line) now at 102, implied volatility still looks like a conservative
    estimate of the potential future moves in IMOS, particularly when one considers
    that daily trading volumes are now running at about five times the three month
    average.

    has been on the call side.

    not to step in front of, but having closed out my long positions, I now find that
    there are a couple of defined risk trades on the short side that have some potential.
