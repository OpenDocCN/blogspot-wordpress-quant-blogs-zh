- en: There are many excellent web sites out there that specialize in a small slice
    of the economic universe, as *VIX and More* does, and in due time I’d like to
    think that I will be able to shine some light on most of the better ones.

    run by a self-described “small group of middle aged and older investors who got
    fed up with the lack of straight and relatively simple data on investing and economics,
    and put up a web site to address our various concerns.”

    when the Fed decided [back in March 2006](http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/discm3.htm)
    to stop publishing M3 data, NowAndFutures stepped up with their own [M3](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/M3)
    model and started publishing what they are calling M3b – [a very close approximation](http://www.nowandfutures.com/articles/20060426M3b,_repos_&_Fed_watching.html)
    to the discontinued M3 number.

    in the system are starting to show up in the money supply data, including the
    M3b calculation, which is depicted in the NowAndFutures graph below.  In some
    respects, volatility is the opposite of liquidity, so those who are wondering
    why the VIX has a 21 handle and is trading below the 200 day SMA for the first
    time in months can look to the recent dramatic expansion of the money supply for
    a large part of the explanation.
