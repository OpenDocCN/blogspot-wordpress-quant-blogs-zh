    must decide how to assign the losses. If it assigns them to the household sector,
    it will put significant downward pressure both on household income growth (which
    will be less than GDP growth) and, consequently, on consumption growth. Rebalancing
    means effectively that consumption growth (and household income growth) must exceed
    GDP growth, which means that even if GDP growth slows to 3-4%, as I expect, household
    income can continue growing at 5-6%. This explains why, contrary to the consensus,
    a more slowly growing, rebalancing China will not lead to social unrest.
