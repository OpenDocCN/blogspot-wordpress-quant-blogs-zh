    telecom, oil refining. etc. John Hempton called this arrangement [a kleptocracy](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/macroeconomics-of-chinese-kleptocracy.html) because

    Japanese companies found out in the late 1980's, it's easy to make money when
    your cost of capital is that low. You borrow as much as you can and invest in
    something, anything with a positive real return. If you are positioned properly,
    you can make obscene profits - and they did.

    trying to find step-by-step progress toward economic liberalization. The disjunction
    between foreign and domestic understanding of what constitutes "reform," in fact,
    illuminates a fundamental misunderstanding of foreign commercial involvement.
    In today's post Third Plenum China, "reform" means to sideline and squash institutionalized
    bureaucracy and inject personal power into a sclerotic system. It means cutting
    through the layers of paperwork that invite bribery.

- en: But what China has never had and never meant by its use of the word "reform"
    is the codification in law and practice of rules to govern transparently and at
    scale a growing economy. Rules are seen as stultifying, an impediment to the ability
    of the core ruling class to impose its will. The color of China's huge library
    of new laws, rules, and regulations is gray, leaving broad license for administrators
    to enforce them. The consequence is a large measure of chaos in the actual regulation
    of industry and commerce.

    it will put significant downward pressure both on household income growth (which
    will be less than GDP growth) and, consequently, on consumption growth. Rebalancing
    means effectively that consumption growth (and household income growth) must exceed
    GDP growth, which means that even if GDP growth slows to 3-4%, as I expect, household
    income can continue growing at 5-6%. This explains why, contrary to the consensus,
