# Humble Student of the Markets: ZBT missed - again!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/11/zbt-missed-again.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/11/zbt-missed-again.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**: It is ironic that four weeks ago today, I pointed out that the market missed flashing a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal by one day (see [Trading the breadth thrust](https://twitter.com/WillieDelwiche/status/1326509798318333954)). Market breadth, as measured by the ZBT Indicator, has to rise from an oversold level of 0.40 to an overbought reading of 0.615 or more within a 10-day window. Four weeks ago, it achieved that in 11 days, and the rally fizzled sooner afterward.

The ZBT buy signal is extremely rare, and it has occurred only six times since 2004\. In all instances, the market has been higher in 12-months, though it "failed" on two occasions inasmuch as it pulled back before roaring ahead to new highs. 

I observed on the weekend that we are on the verge of another possible ZBT buy signal (see [Zweig Breadth Thrust and triple-top watch](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/08/zweig-breadth-thrust-and-triple-top-watch/)). The 10-day window ends today. Alas, the ZBT just failed to flash a buy signal. It topped out yesterday (Tuesday) at 0.606, which was just short of its 0.615 target, and it retreated today.

Despite the setback, all may not be lost.
