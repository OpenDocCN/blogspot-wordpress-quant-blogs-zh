    Stéphane Tyc at the Institut Louis Bachelier in Paris, about best execution, timestamps
    and exchanges (in this previous [post](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2013/12/23/high-frequency-trading-liquidity-and-stability/)
    I only summarized his speech):'

    to the issue. In typical fashion the USA defines precisely what needs to be reported
    and also defines the mechanisms of order protection on various trading venues.
    On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU imparts on the Brokers an obligation
    to take “all reasonable steps to obtain, when executing orders on behalf of clients,
    the best possible result”. The challenge of “best execution” does not have a known
    solution, and the proliferation of order types makes the quest for a perfect solution
    unrealistic. The real time aspect of the problem makes it particularly intractable.There
    is, however, a possibility which could shed light on the best execution riddle.
    Exchanges produce timestamps at the most important times of the matching cycle.
    They also identify every matched trade with a unique number. The regulators could
    define standards for this information and impose the end of day publication of
    the raw data from the exchanges. Every matched trade should have attached :'

    available with PTP (Precision Time Protocol). This way, all the issues of synchronicity
    could be studied very precisely.

    A simple code to read this data should be provided under an open source license.

    benefits for transparency very high. All dark pools, broker crossing networks
    and other alternative non public execution venues should also be required to publish
    their trades with the same mechanism.

    of trade id numbers that constituted his execution and could go and find for himself
    if the execution was to his standards.

    and enable research to shed light on this very challenging problem.”
