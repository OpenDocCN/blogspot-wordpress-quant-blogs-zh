# Humble Student of the Markets: The Art of the Deal meets the Art of the Possible

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-art-of-deal-meets-art-of-possible.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-art-of-deal-meets-art-of-possible.html#0001-01-01)

In his

[2019 State of the Union address](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-state-union-address-2/)

, President Trump said he was seeking "real structural change" to China's economy:

> I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.

In the next breath, he referred to the reboot of NAFTA, which only yielded minor changes:

> Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.
> 
> Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven’t had delivered to for a long time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: “Made in the USA.

While Trump positions himself as a master dealmaker in his book

*The Art of the Deal*

, it is said that politics is the art of the possible. Let us consider what is actually possible during these rounds of US-China trade negotiations.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***
