    7.1% in [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en), 5.3% in
    [Rock-Tenn (RKT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkt&hl=en), and 4.5% in
    [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en) accounting for the
    bulk of the damage.  As a result of the three hard hits, the portfolio’s margin
    over the benchmark S&P 500 index has fallen all the way from 4.75% to 1.70%.  The
    coming week should provide a good test of the resilience of the portfolio’s holdings.  Frankly,
    I would expect to see some changes if we don’t see signs of improvement in the
    options expiration week ahead.
