    at a 5 day low in 21 days. It seemed to me that the 1st decent pullback after
    a long run higher could provide a bullish edge. So I tested it. There were only
    7 previous instances of runs of 20-days or longer. In a search for more meaningful
    results I lowered the requirement to 10-days. Those results are below:'

    The winning percentage is a bit disappointing. It isn’t much better than random.
    In all I’d say there’s a mild edge that largely plays out in the 1st 2 days.
