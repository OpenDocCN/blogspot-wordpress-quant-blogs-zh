Each day's spread individually.

Some of the major turbulence in the spread occurs July 21 around 11:40am CST.  The following is a closer look at the volatility of the relationship during this period.  The left chart is the full hour, from 11:00am - 12:00pm CST, and the right chart is the 15-minute period, from 11:40am - 11:55am CST, marking the first of a series of significant downward pressures on the GLD/GC relationship.
