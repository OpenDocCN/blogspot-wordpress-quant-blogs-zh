# Magmasystems Blog: Event Stream Processing

Marco blogs about Event Stream Processing (ESP) at

[http://rulecore.com/espblog/](http://rulecore.com/espblog/)

. There is also a

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Stream_Processing_%28ESP%29)

article about it.

ESP is especially interesting in the financial markets, where you want to perform real-time decision making on a stream of quotes coming from your market data distribution infrastructure. ESP gives you opportunities for things like algorithmic trading and real-time risk management.

Companies in this space include Gemstone (Gemfire), KX (KDB+), Vhayu, Streambase, Aleri. I would like to see Microsoft get into this space with a future version of SQL Server. (Since I have some meetings coming up with some people from Microsoft, I will be sure to ask this question.)

I will definitely be exploring this space in the near future.
