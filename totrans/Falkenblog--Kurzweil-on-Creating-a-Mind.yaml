    have oxytocin and vasopressin receptors that give them a feeling of 'love', and
    those where dads are just sperm donors don't. Hard wired emotions dictate behavior.
     Perhaps computers can have emotions, you can put in something for sadness when
    they aren't called by other programs or people, a desire to see users with physical
    correlates to fertility like smooth skin and tone bodies. But it's one thing to
    program an aversion to solitude, another to desire a truly independent will.

- en: Proto humans presumably had the consciousness of dogs, so something in our striving
    created human consciousness incidentally. Schopenhauer said "we don't want a thing
    because we have found reasons for it, we find reasons for it because we want it."
    The intellect may at times to lead the will, but only as a guide leads the master.
    He saw the will to power, and fear of death, as being the essence of humanity.
     Nietzsche noted similarly that "Happiness is the feeling that power increases."
     I suppose one could try to put this into a program as a deep preference, but
    I'm not sure how, in that, what power to a computer could be analogous to power
    wielded by humans?

  zh: 原始人类可能有犬类的意识，所以我们的努力中的一些东西意外地创造了人类意识。叔本华说“我们之所以想要一件东西并不是因为我们找到了为它的理由，而是我们为它找到了理由，因为我们想要它”。智力有时可能引导意志，但只是像向导引导主人一样。他看到了权力的意志和对死亡的恐惧，作为人类本质的一部分。尼采同样指出，“幸福就是力量增加的感觉”。我想也许可以将这一点作为一个深层次的偏好纳入程序中，但我不确定在这方面，计算机对于人类行使的权力可以有何种类似？
- en: Kierkegaard thought the crux of human consciousness was anxiety, worrying about
    doing the right thing.  That is, consciousness is not merely having perceptions
    and thoughts, even self-referential thoughts, but doubt, anxiety about one's priorities
    and how well one is mastering them. We all have multiple priorities--self preservation,
    sensual pleasure, social status, meaning--and the higher we go the more doubtful
    we are about them. Having no doubt, like having no worries, isn't bliss, it's
    the end of consciousness.  That's what always bothers me about people who suggest
    we search for flow, because like good music or wine, it's nice occasionally like
    any other sensual pleasure, but only occasionally in the context of a life of

  zh: Kierkegaard 认为人类意识的关键是焦虑，担心做正确的事情。意识不仅仅是具有感知和思维，甚至是自我参照的思维，而是怀疑，对自己的优先事项以及自己掌握它们的熟练程度的焦虑。我们都有多个优先事项——自我保存、感官享乐、社会地位、意义——我们越往上走，对它们的怀疑就越多。没有怀疑，就像没有烦恼，不是幸福，而是意识的终结。这就是我对那些提议我们寻找心流的人们总是困扰的原因，因为像好的音乐或美酒一样，它偶尔是愉悦的，但只是在生活的某些时刻。

    and once he has developed some gonads, smells around for a gigantic female. When
    he finds her, he bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin
    of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. He
    is then fed by, and has his waste removed by, the female's blood supply, as the
    male is basically turned into a parasite. However, he is a welcomed parasite,
    because the female needs his sperm. What happens to a welcomed parasite? Other
    than his gonads, his organs simply disappear, because all that remains is all
    that is needed. No eyes, no jaw, no brain. He has achieved his purpose, has no
    worries, and could just chill in some Confucian calm, but instead just dissolves
    his brain entirely.

- en: A computer needs pretty explicit goals because otherwise the state space of
    things it will do blows up, and one can end up figuratively calculating the 10^54th
    digit of pi--difficult to be sure, and not totally useless, but still pretty useless.
     Without anxiety one could easily end up in an intellectual cul-de-sac and not
    care.  I don't see how a computer program with multiple goals would feel anxiety,
    because they don't have finite lives, so they can work continuously, forever,
    making it nonproblematic that one didn't achieve some goal by the time one's eggs
    ran out.  Our anxiety makes us satisfice, or find novel connections that do not
    what we originally wanted but do what's very useful nonetheless, and in the process
    helped increase our sense of meaning and status (often, by helping others).

- en: Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche were all creative, deep thinkers about
    the essence of humanity, and they were all very lonely and depressed. When young
    they thought they were above simple romantic pair bonds, but all seemed to have
    deep regrets later, and I think this caused them to apply themselves more resolutely
    to abstract ideas (also, alas, women really like confidence in men, which leads
    to all sorts of interesting issues, including that their doubt hindered their
    ability to later find partners, and that perhaps women aren't fully conscious
    (beware troll!)). Humans have trade-offs, and we are always worrying if we are
    making the right ones, because no matter how smart you are, you can screw up a
    key decision and pay for it the rest of your life. We need fear, pride, shame,
    lust, depression and envy, in moderation, and I think you can probably get those
    into a computer.  But anxiety, doubt, I don't think can be programmed because
    logically a computer is always doing the very best it can in that's its only discretion
    is purely random, and so it perceives only risk and not uncertainty, and thus,
    no doubt.

    by Keynes and Knight.  If it is truly non-quantifiable, then a computer can not
    understand it, and they will never empathize with us correctly, never accurately
    have a 'theory of mind' that comes naturally for humans.  After all, without uncertainty,
    there really isn't doubt, which Schopenhauer said was the essence of consciousness.
    So, the search for AI, and a model of 'real risk', seemed joined at the hip.
