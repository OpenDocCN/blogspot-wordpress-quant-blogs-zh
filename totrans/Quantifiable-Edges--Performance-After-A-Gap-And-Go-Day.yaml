    below its 200 day moving average. For the Nasdaq 55% of the time the gap was filled
    within 5 days and 74% of the time within 10 days. For the S&P the results again
    were not nearly as negative. Only 41% were filled within 5 days and 55% within
    10 days.

    may not be a few days before that begins, though.
