    Batterymarch was a pioneer in indexing. In the late 70's, when the custodian banks
    moved into the investing business in a serious way, Batterymarch was an innovator
    into quantitative equity management, first in the US and later internationally.
    Back then, whoever dreamed of using quantitative techniques in strange places
    like *gasp* Japan??? In the mid-1980`s, Batterymarch was the first institutional
    investor in Latin America - and that effort branched out into other emerging markets.

    to bring quantitative equity management to Canada. Later, I moved to Boston to
    be a PM as part of the international equity team, though I did work on both US
    and emerging market groups during my tenure. It was a heady time for a thirtysomething
    portfolio manager who was just learning the business. The experience was like
    stepping from the minors to the major league.

    to have had the opportunity to learn about many aspects of the investment business
    that many of my peers may not have been exposed to in a lifetime, from building
    quantitative stock selection models, to portfolio construction and optimization,
    to trading, to model and portfolio analysis and, last but not least, marketing
    and client service. The unfortunate fact for many young quants today is that they
    become overly specialized and become an expert in only one discipline, e.g. portfolio
    optimization, without knowing how the whole investment process worked together.
