## Thinking in Graphs

Has anyone done any work with [neo4j](http://2011.geecon.org/materials/presentations/2011_webber-a_programmatic_introduction_to_neo4j.pdf) or similar graph database, and trade data storage?  [This](http://www.benstopford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Thinking-in-Graphs.pdf) deck provide a view of asset management, which is interesting, but I am more interested in capital market usage – trade/risk data.  This [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/peterneubauer/gdm-2011-neo4j-and-real-world-apps) has an Energy Simulation powered by neo4j.
