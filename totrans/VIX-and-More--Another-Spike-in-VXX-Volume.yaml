    Futures ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) is a lot

    investors with its siren song promise of huge profits ahead of the next, inevitable,
    just-around-the-corner selloff in stocks. Unfortunately for VXX longs, the hoped
    for VIX spike usually turns out to be much more elusive than anticipated and investors
    who fail to tie themselves to their masts typically end up shipwrecked on the
    treacherous shore of complacency.

- en: A glimpse at the biggest volume spikes in the history of VXX (see chart below)
    shows that almost all of these happen at near the top of a VIX spike and leave
    longs exposed to a sharp downturn. The notable exceptions are largely limited
    to last August, when a surge in VXX trading volume accompanied the first leg up
    of what turned out to be a multi-stage rally in the VIX and VXX.

    traded yesterday, the only stock that traded more shares was [BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC))
    is likely to turn out to be some combination of wishful thinking and an overreaction
    to yesterday’s mini-spike, when the VIX traded over 17.00 for the first time in
    thirteen sessions. Then again, history has not been a very good guide for the
    last few years and [triskaidekaphobics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia)
    in particular should always prepare for the worst…
