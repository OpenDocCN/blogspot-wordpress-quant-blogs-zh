    that told you the price of gold were to triple within two years. Given this piece
    of information, what should you buy in order to maximize your gain?

  zh: 那篇帖子 then 需要一个澄清。假设你有一个水晶球，告诉你黄金的价格在两年内会翻三倍。鉴于这一信息，为了最大化你的收益，你应该买什么？
- en: Buying gold by itself will give you a gain of 200%. Buying a two-year call on
    gold with a $600 strike will give you a projected gain of about 300%. If you change
    the strike to $900, the projected gain is about 550%.

  zh: 仅仅购买黄金本身会让你获得200%的收益。购买一个两年期的黄金看涨期权，行权价为600美元，预计收益大约为300%。如果你将行权价改为900美元，预计收益大约为550%。
- en: If you buy gold stocks given its poor fundamentals of rising production costs
    and their resultant pattern of disappointing leverage, gains are likely to be
    200% or less. An investor would be taking on more volatility risk but at the price
    of little or no incremental gain.

  zh: 如果你考虑到黄金股票上升的生产成本及其导致的令人失望的杠杆模式，而购买黄金股票，那么收益很可能不超过200%。投资者可能会承担更多的波动风险，但可能几乎没有额外的收益。

- en: There are, however, times that gold stocks can be good trading vehicles. As
    many readers pointed out, they were a screaming buy compared to bullion early
    this year. Unfortunately, gold stocks are trading vehicles in the same way leveraged
    ETFs are trading vehicles. For longer term investors, their risk-reward characteristics
    are bound to disappoint.

  zh: 然而，有些时候黄金股票可以是好的交易工具。正如许多读者指出的，今年年初与金条相比，它们是极其便宜的。不幸的是，黄金股票和杠杆ETF一样，都是交易工具。对于长期投资者来说，它们的风险回报特性肯定会让人失望。
