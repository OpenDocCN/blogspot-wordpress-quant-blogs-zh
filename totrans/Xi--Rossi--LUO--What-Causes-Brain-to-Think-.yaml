     Indirect measures of brain activities are usually preferred, such as fMRI, but
    the resulting statistics usually cannot resolve the causality issue.  The simple
    box plots (image below, left) show no significant differences of the brain activity
    under two experimental conditions.  Without modeling what the indirect response
    function looks like (e.g.
