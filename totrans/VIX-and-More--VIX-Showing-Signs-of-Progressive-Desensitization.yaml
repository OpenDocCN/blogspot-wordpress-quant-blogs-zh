- en: Since hitting a high of 1219 April, the S&P 500 index has fallen below 1045
    on three separate occasions, most notably during yesterday’s session, when the
    SPX dropped all the way down to 1035.

- en: Interestingly, each successive time the SPX has dropped below 1045, the corresponding
    [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) has topped
    out at a lower level, as highlighted by the green arrows. Back on May 25^(th),
    when the SPX fell as low as 1040, the VIX spiked as high as 43.73\. When the SPX
    fell to 1042 on June 8^(th), the VIX only made as high as 37.38\. Yesterday, when
    the SPX fell below a critical support level at 1040 and went as low as 1035, the
    VIX was only able to muster a spike to 35.39.

- en: The increasing sluggishness in the VIX reflects what I call a progressive desensitization
    to fundamental factors (e.g., the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    a potential double dip in housing, etc.) and technical factors (the breaching
    of support at SPX 1040) that investors experience after the novelty of various
    threats – including very serious ones – begins to wear off.

- en: In fact, it is common for the VIX to be less responsive to subsequent breakdowns
    in stocks. This is a subject I discussed at some length in [VIX Spikes and the
    2002 Market Bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vix-spikes-and-2002-market-bottom.html)
    and again on March 6, 2009 (what timing!) in [Markets Continue to Fall, VIX Relatively
    Flat](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/markets-continue-to-fall-vix-relatively.html).
    The pattern of a progressive desensitization in the VIX is fairly common and can
    be seen once again in the chart below.

- en: Note that in terms of implications, this means that once investors have become
    somewhat accustomed to a declining market, it will be more problematic to rely
    on the VIX spiking to a new high as a signal for a [market bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/market%20bottoms).
