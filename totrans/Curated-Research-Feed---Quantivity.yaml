    more time in several fields of the quant literature. Primary topics bookend the
    spectrum: asset allocation and computationally-intensive intraday, including crash
    modeling across all frequencies. Focus includes both published literature, along
    with real-time preprints from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/), [SSRN](http://www.ssrn.com/),
    and numerous Fed. Given volume of articles, effective organization and search
    have evolved to become a bit burdensome.'

    of curated literature links, each with short descriptive blurb. Of particular
    relevance are support for time ordering and search. The former is useful for accentuating
    episodic memory, as time and context matter when recollecting and synthesizing.
    The latter is useful for cross-sectional analysis, pulling together specific themes.'

    wish existed, as the old saying goes), perhaps some readers may find small modicum
    of benefit. For those readers, feel free to follow [@Quantivity](http://twitter.com/quantivity).
    Topics of particular interest will continue to warrant dedicated posts here. Finally,
    note citations neither imply endorsement nor should be interpreted as “hints”
    on alpha; part of the joy of research is diversity.
