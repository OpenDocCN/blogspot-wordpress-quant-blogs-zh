    to come to terms that the SPX Peak to Trough Summary Chart is going to be a regular
    feature on the blog for the time being.

- en: This time around I have made a couple of minor changes. First, the 9.1% pullback
    of June-July 2009 is now highlighted in gray and the current pullback is highlighted
    in light red. Second, I have highlighted in a darker red those cells which indicate
    the current selloff has reached an important threshold. In the case of today’s
    low of 1062.78, the highlighting reflects the fact that the low is now below the
    much shallower lows from November and December. Of course, a pattern of lower
    lows will likely encourage additional selling and set the stage for a possible
    test of the next important support level in the area of SPX 1030-1035.

    from peak to trough over the course of the last 12 trading days. In absolute terms,
    this makes the current pullback the largest since the beginning of the March 2009
    rally. My preferred measure is not points but percentages, which ranks the current
    7.6% pullback as #2 behind the June-July 2009 selloff.'

    help forecast where and when it will end. It does reinforce the point, however,
    that if the SPX closes below 1030 that we should begin talking about a bear market
    instead of a pullback. For the record, the 200 day moving average should be up
    to 1030 in about two weeks, at which point the SPX will also be fighting a rising
    moving average tide in order to remain technically bullish.
