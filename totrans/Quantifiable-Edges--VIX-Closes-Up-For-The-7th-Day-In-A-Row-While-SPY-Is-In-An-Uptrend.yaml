- en: One notable bit of action is that Wednesday marked the 7th day in a row that
    the VIX has risen.  That is a very unusual streak.  I decided to look back at
    all other times the VIX had risen for 7 days in a row while SPY was above its
    200ma.  Below are results of SPY assuming a 3-day holding period.

    little drawdown compared to both the run-up and the average trade.  This appears
    to be worth some consideration.
