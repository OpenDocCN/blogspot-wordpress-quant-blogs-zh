    the actual GDP growth rate, or about the growth rate either of household wealth
    or of state wealth. It just tells us something very important about the relative
    growth rates. For example we can posit a case in which GDP grows by 9% annually
    while household income grows by 12-13% annually. In that case the rest of the
    economy would grow by roughly 5-6% annually (household income is approximately
    half of GDP), and the distribution of this growth would be shared between the
    sate sector and the business sector. This might be considered the “good case”
    scenario of rebalancing...

    cases China rebalances, but the way in which it rebalances can have very different
    growth implications. Second, notice that even in the bad case, household income
    growth can be quite robust, which means that fears of social instability as Chinese
    growth slows are very exaggerated if a slowdown in Chinese growth occurs with
    real rebalancing.

    years. Most immediate is the excessive debt built up from white elephant infrastructure
    projects on the government side, and a property bubble on the private side. Longer
    term, China is facing an aging population (see our May 2011 publication entitled
    China’s long-term growth headwinds) and the prospect of reaching a “Lewis turning
    point”, where labour productivity falls because China is running out of cheap
    labour from the rural regions, which pushes up wages and gains from rising labour
    productivity falls.

    taking steps to address these one by one. ***Our base case calls for continued

    exports and domestic consumer spending.***

    over time, but growth will continue. What is admirable about Pettis' analysis
    is he goes into the implications of different policy options that the government
    has in order to effect these changes.
