    Algo Trading platform,just the simple ESP platform). I filled out a form, and
    now I have to wait for a Progress sales rep to call to arrange a demo. Even if
    I want to see an Apama webcast, I need to fill out a form.

    developer platform, with all of the documentation included. Everything is included
    .... there are no important packages that are missing with the eval version. There
    is no 30-day license key that you have to get. There is no waiting for a salesperson
    to get in touch. As far as I know, you get everything is ready to go from the
    time you download the package.

- en: I fail to understand why certain vendors make it so difficult to evaluate a
    package. In a big financial institution like the one I work for, if you use software
    in production and this software is not properly licensed and paid for, it is grounds
    for termination of your job.

    as possible as spread the word around.
