- en: 'The study began with 40 subjects blindly picking ping-pong balls from a hat.
    Half of the balls were labeled "rich," while the other half were labeled "poor."
    The rich subjects were immediately given $50, while the poor got nothing. Such

    their brains showed more reward activity than when they themselves were given
    an equivalent amount. In other words, they got extra pleasure from the gains of

    in favor of higher taxes. Success in life is a combination of luck, effort, and
    ability. One big difference between Conservatives and Liberals is the relative
    weighting they see on luck and effort in our lives.

  zh: 如果生活的回报主要是任意的，我同意人们会赞成更高的税收。成功在生活中是运气、努力和能力的结合。保守派和自由派之间一个很大的区别在于他们看待我们生活中运气和努力的相对权重。

    or buy specific products (iPads), which then skew the distribution of income.
    To take away the rewards to such people and products will mean these services
    and products do not exist, which is a worse state of affairs, as demonstrated
    by people''s willingness to pay for these things in the initial state. Virtue
    and vice are basically defined by their statistical results to the actor, so these
    payoffs are not incidental but rather intrinsically related to what is called
    good and bad behavior.'

- en: People like fairness, but this means different things depending on how rewards
    are created. It is fair to redistribute random bounties, not fair to redistribute
    wealth that motivated its creation. While one might think that if they had a mechanism
    to distinguish the two and tax accordingly this would be an improvement, the fact
    is taxes and state fees are created via a collective mechanism that is more about
    fortifying coalitions via patronage jobs on the one end and barriers to entry
    on the other. Thus, it is fairer in the real world to minimize the state Leviathon
    so these truly arbitrary allocations are minimized. For example, I'm sure many
    unskilled workers would prefer to have jobs at the Post Office, but these positions
    are primarily distributed independent of ability and effort.

  zh: 人们喜欢公平，但这取决于奖励是如何产生的。重新分配随机奖励是公平的，但重新分配因其创造而激发的财富则不公平。尽管有人认为，如果他们有一种机制来区分这两者并相应征税，这将是一种改进，但事实是税收和国家费用是通过一个更关于通过赏赐工作岗位来巩固联盟的集体机制创建的，另一方面则是为了进入壁垒。因此，在现实世界中，减少国家的力量是更公平的，以便减少这些真正武断的分配。例如，我相信许多无技能的劳工更希望在邮局工作，但这些职位主要独立于能力和努力分配。
