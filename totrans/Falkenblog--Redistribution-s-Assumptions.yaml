    Half of the balls were labeled "rich," while the other half were labeled "poor."
    The rich subjects were immediately given $50, while the poor got nothing. Such
    is life: It''s rarely fair.'

    their brains showed more reward activity than when they themselves were given
    an equivalent amount. In other words, they got extra pleasure from the gains of
    someone with less.

    in favor of higher taxes. Success in life is a combination of luck, effort, and
    ability. One big difference between Conservatives and Liberals is the relative
    weighting they see on luck and effort in our lives.

    massive egalitarian redistribution would be preferred.

    or buy specific products (iPads), which then skew the distribution of income.
    To take away the rewards to such people and products will mean these services
    and products do not exist, which is a worse state of affairs, as demonstrated
    by people''s willingness to pay for these things in the initial state. Virtue
    and vice are basically defined by their statistical results to the actor, so these
    payoffs are not incidental but rather intrinsically related to what is called
    good and bad behavior.'

    are created. It is fair to redistribute random bounties, not fair to redistribute
    wealth that motivated its creation. While one might think that if they had a mechanism
    to distinguish the two and tax accordingly this would be an improvement, the fact
    is taxes and state fees are created via a collective mechanism that is more about
    fortifying coalitions via patronage jobs on the one end and barriers to entry
    on the other. Thus, it is fairer in the real world to minimize the state Leviathon
    so these truly arbitrary allocations are minimized. For example, I'm sure many
    unskilled workers would prefer to have jobs at the Post Office, but these positions
    are primarily distributed independent of ability and effort.
