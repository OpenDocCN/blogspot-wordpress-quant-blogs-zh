- en: To give you the punch line, I think the outlook for growth in economic activity
    and the labor market is good. However, inflation is too low, and it has been too
    low for the last 6 years. Moreover, my forecast is for inflation to rise at a
    very gradual pace, reaching our 2 percent objective only in 2018\. Based on this
    forecast, and the risks to the outlook, I think the FOMC should refrain from raising
    the federal funds rate (our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool)
    until there is much greater confidence that inflation one or two years ahead will
    be at our 2 percent target. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry
    to tighten financial conditions until then.

    the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation
    that they are indeed a transitory aberration. Furthermore, and most important,
    inflation is low and is expected to remain low for some time.'

    tightness and rate normalization. The latest BoAML Fund Manager Survey indicates
    that the consensus for first liftoff is either 3Q or 4Q, with 3Q being the most
    likely. My base case scenario therefore calls for a September rate hike, largely
    because the Fed seems to prefer to guide and nudge markets, rather than to surprise
    them.
