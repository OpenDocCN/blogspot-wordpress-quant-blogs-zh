- en: Today the [CXO Advisory Blog](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/) is out with an assessment
    of the predictive value of put to call ratios for individual stocks.  Drawing
    heavily on Jun Pan and Allen Poteshman’s 2006 “[The Information in Option Volume
    for Future Stock Prices](http://www.business.uiuc.edu/poteshma/research/panPoteshman2006.pdf)”
    from [The Review of Financial Studies](http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/), the folks
    at CXO conclude that put to call ratios have “*significant predictive power for
    individual stocks*.”  Unfortunately, there is a qualifier that “*this effect relates
    predominantly to data that is not publicly available*.” [underline in original]

    the qualifier.  In “[How to Find the Earnings Spiker Before the Announcement](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-find-earnings-spiker-before.html)”
    I highlighted the put to call ratio for individual stocks as a key component of
    the screening formula and provided a link to the [SchaeffersResearch.com](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/indicators/equity_oipcratio.aspx)
    page where you can find the appropriate charts and data.  This data is both public
    and free; you can’t beat that.

    called [ISEE Select](http://www.iseoptions.com/Market_Data/ISEE_Select.asp) that
    the exchange describes as a “trading tool that uses proprietary call/put trade
    data from the ISE to identify bullish and bearish sentiment for individual securities.”  The
    ISE goes on to explain that ISEE Select “allows subscribers to retrieve intraday
    and historical call/put values for securities whose options are traded on ISE.”  For
    the record, I intend to give ISEE Select a try shortly and will be glad to provide
    my thoughts about the value of this service in this space.  In the interim, interested
    parties may want to check out ISEE Select [services and pricing](http://www.iseoptions.com/Market_Data/About_ISEE.asp),
    as well as their [FAQs](http://www.iseoptions.com/Market_Data/ISEE_Select_FAQ.asp).
