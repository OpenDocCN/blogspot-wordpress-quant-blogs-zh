    that Al adds dubious value on his various boards and venture investments, as his
    main value consists of knowing the right regulators and big government contractors,
    crony capitalism, which is much more destructive than those dreaded limit orders
    that are often cancelled.  The thought that this guy is a Nobel Peace Price winner,
    Oscar Nominee and centimillionaire should remind everyone that Life Isn't Fair
    because he hasn't had an original or courageous thought in his life, as his book
    presents a caricature of free markets that is obviously indefensible. Only the

    believing in more government the other in less, one side is mere folly or cupidity.

    strong opinions on how much assets should trade, even though it doesn't affect
    them. They hate the idea that someone's getting rich doing something they don't
    think adds value, though it occurs in a competitive environment. If the average
    daily volume for a stock was 100% of the shares outstanding, should it optimally
    be 200%? 50%? I don't think anyone knows, anymore than one knows whether interest
    rates should be 2% or 5%. The great thing about markets is that while they are
    often wrong, they correct themselves a lot faster than collectives do, and further,
    they decentralize decision making. Asset markets don't just produce prices, but
    they allocate investments to their highest perceived value; when wrong, the owners
    pay the price, so incentives are aligned.

  zh: 很奇怪，很多对资产交易没有真正兴趣或了解的人都对资产交易量有很强的意见，尽管这不影响他们。他们讨厌这样一个想法，即有人因为他们认为没有增加价值的事情而变得富有，尽管这发生在竞争环境中。如果一只股票的平均每日成交量占流通股的100%，那么它的最优成交量应该是200%吗？还是50%？我不认为任何人知道，就像没有人知道利率应该是2%还是5%一样。市场的伟大之处在于，尽管它们经常是错误的，但它们纠正自己的速度远远快于集体，而且它们分散了决策。资产市场不仅仅产生价格，而且将投资分配给它们被认为价值最高的地方；当错误时，所有者会付出代价，因此激励是对齐的。

    nexus and these firms are merely accessing it, but that metaphor is as misguided
    as their entropy-flow thesis (not discussed here, but its a vague metaphor these
    authors think is the key to everything). How does HFT reduce risks, and for whom?
    I actually think of HFT as simply trying to efficiently parcel orders out of a
    big trade, and reacting quickly to movements in related securities when providing
    liquidity. This reduces the risk to retail traders because it gives them greater
    liquidity because placing a bunch of limit orders at the best bid/ask is like
    being an electronic market maker.  This allows regular Joe's to trade without
    moving prices so much, and at more efficient prices. It does not reduce risk for
    the high frequency trader himself, as this activity generally takes risks because
    you can't make profits without taking risks in this highly competitive domain.
    Further, taking intraday positions does not generate a positive return per se,
    so there's no risk-return relationship merely for taking the position.

  zh: 就风险和回报的讨论大多数情况下，他们都暗示着有一个风险-回报关系，并且这些公司只是在利用它，但这个隐喻和他们的熵流论（此处未讨论，但这是这些作者认为是一切的关键的一个模糊隐喻）一样错导。高频交易是如何降低风险的，对谁来说呢？我实际上认为高频交易只是试图有效地将订单分配出去，以及在提供流动性时迅速对相关证券的波动做出反应。这降低了零售交易者的风险，因为它为他们提供了更大的流动性，因为在最佳买卖价位放置一堆限价单就像成为一个电子市场做市商。这使普通的交易者在不那么大幅度影响价格的情况下进行交易，并获得更高效的价格。这并不会降低高频交易者自身的风险，因为这种活动通常都是在承担风险的，因为在这个竞争激烈的领域中，没有承担风险就不能盈利。此外，进行日内交易本身并不会产生正收益，因此仅仅是持有头寸并不存在风险-回报关系。
