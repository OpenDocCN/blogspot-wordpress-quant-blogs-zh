    and VCRs, and I would hate to have all projects need a sign off from some centralized
    Star Chamber because that would lead to all sorts of corruption. One could say
    that Al adds dubious value on his various boards and venture investments, as his
    main value consists of knowing the right regulators and big government contractors,
    crony capitalism, which is much more destructive than those dreaded limit orders
    that are often cancelled.  The thought that this guy is a Nobel Peace Price winner,
    Oscar Nominee and centimillionaire should remind everyone that Life Isn't Fair
    because he hasn't had an original or courageous thought in his life, as his book
    presents a caricature of free markets that is obviously indefensible. Only the
    simplest minds can think that in any great controversy such as that between those
    believing in more government the other in less, one side is mere folly or cupidity.

    strong opinions on how much assets should trade, even though it doesn't affect
    them. They hate the idea that someone's getting rich doing something they don't
    think adds value, though it occurs in a competitive environment. If the average
    daily volume for a stock was 100% of the shares outstanding, should it optimally
    be 200%? 50%? I don't think anyone knows, anymore than one knows whether interest
    rates should be 2% or 5%. The great thing about markets is that while they are
    often wrong, they correct themselves a lot faster than collectives do, and further,
    they decentralize decision making. Asset markets don't just produce prices, but
    they allocate investments to their highest perceived value; when wrong, the owners
    pay the price, so incentives are aligned.

    in real time, you would rather see it evaluated at completion, and never compared
    to anything. Further, like the Post Office or Medicare, you would like to have
    no shareholders so you could say you are doing a great job regardless, just point
    out the services provided to customers without a choice. A stock market on such entities would
    highlight how inefficient such programs are being run relative to those who would
    like to run them, and they would have motive, means, and opportunity to follow
    through.

    nexus and these firms are merely accessing it, but that metaphor is as misguided
    as their entropy-flow thesis (not discussed here, but its a vague metaphor these
    authors think is the key to everything). How does HFT reduce risks, and for whom?
    I actually think of HFT as simply trying to efficiently parcel orders out of a
    big trade, and reacting quickly to movements in related securities when providing
    liquidity. This reduces the risk to retail traders because it gives them greater
    liquidity because placing a bunch of limit orders at the best bid/ask is like
    being an electronic market maker.  This allows regular Joe's to trade without
    moving prices so much, and at more efficient prices. It does not reduce risk for
    the high frequency trader himself, as this activity generally takes risks because
    you can't make profits without taking risks in this highly competitive domain.
    Further, taking intraday positions does not generate a positive return per se,
    so there's no risk-return relationship merely for taking the position.

    are mostly moon-bat crazy like those above. Clowns to the left of me, but I find
    myself more broadly sympathetic with the 90% of the jokers to the right such as
    Cam Harvey, John Campbell, or John Cochrane.  Not that I think they are correct,
    just that they are much more fruitful to read than those who think there's a fourth
    law of thermodynamics that's essential to understanding the economy.
