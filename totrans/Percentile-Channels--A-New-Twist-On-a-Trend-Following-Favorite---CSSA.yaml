    which were popularized by the famous “[Turtle Traders](http://turtletrader.com/).”
    In fact, it was the subject of Donchian Channels that started my collaboration
    with Corey Rittenhouse with the popular post [Percent Exposure Donchian Channel
    Method](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/quick-take-percent-exposure-donchian-channel-method/
    "Quick Take: Percent Exposure Donchian Channel Method"). One of the original turtle
    systems used a 55-day donchian channel that bought at new 55-day highs and sold
    at new 55-day lows. This system- along with many other popular systems- suffered
    an erosion in profitability as other people copied the same approach. What has
    often fascinated me is how one might go about front-running such systems to achieve
    superior profitability. While I was thinking about this concept, I theorized that
    entering prior to new highs or lows might create an early entry that would be
    sufficient to avoid false breakouts induced by system traders. As an alternative
    one could use Percentile Channels- which function the same as Donchian Channels
    but instead use the percentile of the price specified instead of a maximum or
    minimum. Below is a picture comparing percentile channels to donchian channels:'

    extended with index data) as a rough proxy for a trend-follower’s portfolio with
    Donchian Channels versus Percentile Channels. The original 55-day Donchian Channel
    is used to trade long or short on new highs/lows, versus a 55-day Percentile Channel
    with a 75th and 25th percentile threshold.

    with earlier entries. Another turtle system–perhaps the most famous- used the
    20-day Donchian Channel. For added robustness, lets see how percentile channels
    might revive this long-broken system:'

    results show that it is possible to revive old systems based on new highs and
    lows using a less restrictive percentile channel approach. This leads to earlier
    entries that avoid the noise generated from competing signals. Regardless, percentile
    channels are just another tool for trend-following and can create a wider range
    of support/resistance type systems by varying the chosen entry/exit threshold.
