# Quantifiable Edges: Back To Back Outside Days In QQQQ

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/03/back-to-back-outside-days-in-qqqq.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/03/back-to-back-outside-days-in-qqqq.html#0001-01-01)

On Monday QQQQ posted a higher high and a lower low than Friday. This is often referred to as an “outside day”. Interestingly, Friday was also an outside day. Two outside days in a row is quite rare. This was only the 19th time it’s been done since 2000\. Looking at performance following the other 18 times shows some compelling results.
