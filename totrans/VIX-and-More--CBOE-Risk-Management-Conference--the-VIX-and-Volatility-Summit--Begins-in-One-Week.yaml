- en: The CBOE calls it the [CBOE Risk Management Conference](http://www.cboermc.com/)
    and I like to think of it as “The VIX Summit,” but by any name I am convinced
    that the 30^(th) annual CBOE RMC (yes, it is even nine years older than the VIX)
    is the top conference of the year for anyone with an interest in the VIX, volatility
    and more broadly in the subject of risk management.

- en: 'Kicking off one week from today, on March 17^(th) in Bonita Springs, Florida,
    the CBOE RMC is the best place I can think of to interact with the top thinkers
    and practitioners in the volatility space. The [speakers](http://www.cboermc.com/speakers/)
    and the [agenda](http://www.cboermc.com/agenda/) are both top notch and as always,
    an abundance of fascinating ideas and information will flow freely outside of
    the formal presentations. Some of the sessions that sound particularly interesting
    to my ear include:'

    place to find ideas to ruminate on and to master the art of volatility cross-pollination.
    After all, it is still a relatively small (but growing) group of aficionados that
    live and breathe volatility. Where else, for instance, can you find a bunch of
    like-minded souls who are already plotting how to implement [VXST](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXST)
    options strategies when these products have not even been launched?

    planning for the 3^(rd) Annual CBOE RME-Europe is ongoing and at this juncture
    the odds favor a location that will appeal to those who are fans of links golf
    courses.
