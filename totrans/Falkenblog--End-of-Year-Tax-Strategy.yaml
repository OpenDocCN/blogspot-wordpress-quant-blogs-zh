    short the bottom 50 losers. US stocks, market cap over $500MM as of Monday.

    winners, short year-to-day losers, in December. As winners have tax gains, and
    losers tax losses, there is good theoretical reason why such portfolios should
    have different returns in December on a partial equilibrium basis. Why take a
    taxable gain in December, when you can postpone it until the next year? Why not
    take the taxable loss now? If all the winners have hesitant sellers, the losers
    willing sellers, winners should outperform losers in December. They did for decades.'

    personal backtests at that time, where I also did market cap and other (clever)
    filters, it had an extremely good history, losing only a couple of times over
    the prior 30 years. Of course, I had an out-of-sample adverse experience.

    over time it will disappear regardless. This is why having an 'equilibrium' result
    for some tendency is important for a strategy everyone knows about, because if
    it's not, it's probably an epiphenomenon, like noting that internet companies
    are good shorts (true if you have 2001 prominent in your sample).

    out of the market after they were discovered. It's best to simply not play a game
    that brokers send to traders in white papers if it is based on being clever, because
    brokers are not clever, but rather conventional wisdom.
