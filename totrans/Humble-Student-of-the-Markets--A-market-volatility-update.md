**Mid-week market update**

: In my weekend post (see

[Good news, bad news from Earnings Season](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/10/29/good-news-bad-news-from-earnings-season/)

), I had identified several sources of potential market volatility this week:

*   Mueller indictments
*   GOP tax plan
*   FOMC decision
*   Fed chair nomination
*   Key macro-economic reports

It's time for an update, and it spells caution for the bulls.
