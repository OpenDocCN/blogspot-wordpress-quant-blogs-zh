- en: Just one week ago, I posted an earlier version of the graphic below in [VXX
    Juice Factor and Portfolio Insurance Implications](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-juice-factor-and-portfolio.html).
    In that article, I explained how daily percentage price changes in VXX (what I
    call the [VXX juice factor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20juice%20factor))
    had been running at the rate of about 70% of the changes in the VIX. This was
    in sharp contrast to the 35-40% my modeling of historical data had led me to expect
    when I published [VXX Tracking VIX at 80+% Today](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-tracking-vix-at-80-today.html)
    the previous week.

    change in the VIX

    (with divergences limited to days in which the percentage changes were small)

    relatively small changes)

- en: On the three days the SPX has dropped more than 4%, VXX has moved 37%, 52% and
    76% as much as the VIX, for an average of 55%
  prefs:

- en: I expect these numbers, particularly the 35% and 55% ones, to come very close
    to matching the long-term performance of VXX relative to the VIX.
