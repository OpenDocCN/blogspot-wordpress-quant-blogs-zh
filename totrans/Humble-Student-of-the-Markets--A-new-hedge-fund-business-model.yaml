    definite return patterns. For example, emerging market hedge fund returns could
    largely be replicated by a portfolio of 50% emerging market stocks and 50% emerging
    market bonds. If hedge fund strategies have betas, why not structure their incentive
    fee to their passive benchmark? In the case of an emerging market hedge fund,
    pay 20% of the outperformance against a 50/50 emerging market stock/bond benchmark,
    rather than an absolute return benchmark?

    exists among hedge fund managers. Having worked at a fund with quarterly incentive
    payouts, I personally experienced the mentality that there are only four important
    dates in the year – the quarter end dates.

- en: One of the problems with the hedge fund industry is the asymmetric nature of
    the return incentives. Heads I win. Tails I walk away. If the fund return suffers
    and the unit value falls significantly below the high-water mark, the manager’s
    incentive to run the fund diminishes. The temptation to close the fund, walk away
    and start afresh grows as the fund returns get more negative.

    the emerging market fund). When I moved from the long-only asset management world
    to the hedge fund world, I was shocked to see that there was a recognition that
    different strategies had return betas but incentive fees were not calculated in
    excess of the beta of the fund. Intermediaries were already pigeonholing hedge
    funds into different strategy groups (e.g. convertible arbitrage, global macro,
    etc.), so that was not a problem. Why are investors paying alpha fees for beta?'

    to any of the other hedge fund strategy benchmarks, then by all means structure
    the incentive fee to a cash benchmark.

    fee in cash, pay it in units of the fund, with a lockup. For example, a fund could
    pay an incentive fee of 20% of a return in excess of a benchmark. The manager
    would then be required to reinvest the incentive fee back into the fund, with
    a three-year lockup. That way, the manager would have strong incentives for risk
    control and blowups would hurt his own wallet a lot more.'
