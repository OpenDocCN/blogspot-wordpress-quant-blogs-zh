- en: After much hard work I am pleased to announce the release of the Quantifiable
    Edges Big Time Swing System. The QE Big Time Swing System simply combines a few
    of my favorite edges into a powerful new swing trading system. The system was
    designed to trade the major indices. It looks to take advantage of high probability,
    high expectancy moves that generally occur about once per month. Using SPY over
    the last 16 years it has shown great consistency in both profits and frequency
    of opportunities. The system trades both long and short in both up and down markets.

    to purchase the open code in Tradestation and Excel formats. While it’s completely
    open it still comes with a supporting web page for purchasers as well as a 2010
    alert service at no extra cost.
