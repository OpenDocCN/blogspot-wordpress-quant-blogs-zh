- en: When it comes to volatility, there are few catalysts that can spook the market
    like the prospect of an oil shortage.  With today’s announcement that crude oil
    inventories fell 8.8 million barrels when analysts were expecting a slight increase
    in inventory levels, the markets reacted sharply, with crude futures immediately
    spiking almost $4 per barrel to over $133.  In spite of today’s jump, crude is
    still trading below the all-time high of $135.09 and has pulled back toward 130.  Still,
    135 will be an important resistance level to watch going forward.  If 135 holds,
    volatility should be contained; if it is breached, expect equities to face and
    volatility to surge with crude prices.
