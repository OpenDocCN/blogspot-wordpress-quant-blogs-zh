    shops who are heavily tied to Tibco RV and EMS. Microsoft will have to really
    exceed Tibco EMS's performance in order for people to take notice. Also, Microsoft
    will have to throw the EMS people a bone and support JMS. I might suggest that
    Microsoft come out with patterns to support synchronous calls over JMS easily.

    have database events published on the message bus. You can also have Excel subscribing
    to the message bus in order to receive real-time stock quotes and position updates,
    and you can also have Excel publishing risk calculations back out to the bus.
    If Microsoft were to have this trio (DB, Excel, bus) tied in seamlessly, then
    this would show Wall Street a real committment.
