    commodity bull (yes that includes gold). I believe that while individuals should
    hold some precious metals or precious metal linked investments in their portfolios
    as a hedge against asset inflation, a gold standard introduces too many unnecessary
    rigidities in the system which creates economic volatility.

    is based on the elegant formula MV = PQ. Holding V (monetary velocity) constant,
    changes in money supply directly changes the GDP level. Under a gold standard,
    money supply is restricted by the supply of gold, based on world mine output.
    National gold supply could shrink because of shocks. As an example, the [Roman
    empire was subjected to credit crunches](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/28/credit-crunch-roman-republic-lecture)
    during wartime when hostile forces captured Roman gold and territory.

    illustrates everything that's wrong with a fixed exchange rate regime. When Greece
    gets in over its head in debt but can't print money and can't devalue because
    they are locked into the euro, you have the recipe for the disaster that faces
    Europe.

    austerity programs to make the numbers work. That sounds great in theory, but
    that road could also lead to popular revolts. Don't forget that

    up. Successive countries chose to devalue their currencies and inflate their way
    out of painful deleveraging (chart below). ***Germany was the exception. Haunted
    by von Havenstein's ghost, it fatefully chose to bear instead the brunt of gold
    standard deflation, experiencing a depression arguably greater even than America’s.
    It was then that something broke in Germany’s collective psyche. With resurgent
    Nazi support, Hitler won power in 1933, his rise facilitated not only by the 1923
    inflation, but by the subsequent fear of inflation.***

    of capital controls) but it kept the value of the Mark pegged against gold. And
    more importantly, says Grice, Germany kept a gold standard mentality – the dictates
    of high interest rates and economic deflation were strenuously adhered to. Indeed,
    by 1932/3, unemployment had risen above 30 per cent.
