    combining multi-indicator/multi-variable models, ultimately I depend on various
    single indicator inputs for this approach. Therefore, having indicators that capture
    something that is slightly different or can reduce the complexity of a model by
    condensing a concept into one number is still highly desirable. A good post by
    Quantum Financier highlights the importance of these issues: [http://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/considerations-in-systemindicator-design/](http://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/considerations-in-systemindicator-design/)

    the typical or middle price over a short to intermediate time frame.  I also wanted
    something that could be normalized so that I could avoid having the inflexibility
    of binary rules, or specific levels for entry and exits.  This was something very
    simple that I came up with that performed well on the S&P500 (SPY), achieving
    nearly a 10% cagr which is impressive for a short-term indicator.
