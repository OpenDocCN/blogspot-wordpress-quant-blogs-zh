- en: Exhibit 1 shows that the standard deviation of excess returns has trended lower
    for U.S. large capitalization mutual funds over the past five decades. The exhibit
    shows the five-year, rolling standard deviation of excess returns for all funds
    that existed at that time. This also fits with the story of declining variance
    in skill along with steady variance in luck. These analyses introduce the possibility
    that the aggregate amount of available alpha—a measure of risk-adjusted excess
    returns—has been shrinking over time as investors have become more skillful. Investing
    is a zero- sum game in the sense that one investor’s outperformance of a benchmark
    must match another investor’s underperformance. Add in the fact that in aggregate
    investors earn a rate of return less than that of the market as a consequence
    of fees, and the challenge for active managers becomes clear.

- en: I got into quantitative investing back in the 1980`s when ideas and models were
    fresh and plentiful. Today, factor investing has become increasingly mainstream,
    and so-called "smart beta" may have exceeded their best before date.
