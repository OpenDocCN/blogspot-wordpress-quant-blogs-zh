    in pace in 4Q12\. In this regard, the recent data have been mixed, raising more

    Admittedly, that deficit would soon re-emerge if Spain brought its unemployment
    rate down to more normal levels from the current 25 per cent rate, but Spanish
    labour costs are still improving quite rapidly, relative to the eurozone average,
