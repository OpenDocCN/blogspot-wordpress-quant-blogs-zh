    DFM-Eco index estimate of current quarter growth rose to 1.8%. Interestingly,
    the rise in our nowcaster is driven by July activity readings that were stronger
    than what was anticipated by the July PMI. The index estimate is now in line with
    our bottom-up forecast (2%) that looks for a stabilization of global growth this
    quarter.

    behavior and policy stances are aligned to deliver the modest lift built into
    the forecast. Our forecast does not expect much in the way of growth, with global
    GDP expected to accelerate only a touch to a still-subpar 2.4% annualized pace
    in pace in 4Q12\. In this regard, the recent data have been mixed, raising more
    “maybes” than certainties. The news from consumers remains upbeat. Our estimates
    of current quarter global consumption growth was lifted again this week as July
    readings were firm and auto sales reports for August surprised to the upside.
    Although less broad-based, it appears that the pace of global inventory accumulation
    has slowed.

    The ECB’s willingness to provide liquidity to a country like Spain is probably
    greater than the IMF’s willingness to help countries in earlier crises, but it
    is still limited by two factors. The first is Germany’s capacity to acquiesce
    to higher Target 2 credits. The second is the ECB board’s willingness to accept
    greater exposure to the Spanish sovereign on its balance sheet. Either of these
    factors could mean that the ECB’s tolerance for providing greater liquidity might

    markets have realised. The current account deficit should be eliminated in 2013\.
    Admittedly, that deficit would soon re-emerge if Spain brought its unemployment
    rate down to more normal levels from the current 25 per cent rate, but Spanish
    labour costs are still improving quite rapidly, relative to the eurozone average,
    on an ongoing basis. This is encouraging, because it implies that the ECB’s provision
    of liquidity might not need to be as open ended in as the market currently fears.
