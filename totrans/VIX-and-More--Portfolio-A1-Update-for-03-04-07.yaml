- en: When I [first announced](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html)
    that I would be using this space to talk about a live portfolio I was operating,
    I was [more than a little concerned](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html)
    that the timing might not be ideal and that I should wait for a possible market
    correction before I rolled out a new portfolio.  I based this opinion on my experience
    that the predecessor portfolios to A1 had demonstrated a greater propensity for
    outperforming the SPX benchmark in up markets than in down markets.  Perhaps I
    should have listened to my gut…

- en: Well, whether we have that correction already in hand or are in the early stages
    of a more substantial bear market, it is time to drill down on the A1 portfolio.  As
    you can see from the attached equity curve below, A1’s performance has slipped
    below that of the SPX as a result of a week in which the five holdings were battered
    more severely than the indices.  Due to last week’s performance, the system’s
    ranking of <place st="on">RIO</place> (a favorite holding over the past two years
    or so) has dropped, triggering a sale.  <place st="on">RIO</place> has been replaced
    by RKT, a packaging company whose stock has tripled over the past year.  RKT sports
    a relatively modest P/E 16 for 2007 earnings and a 1.9 PEG that puts it well below
    the industry average.  In addition to a revenue growth story that is in sharp
    contrast to the industry trend, RKT has demonstrated continued pricing power it
    its markets.  This is not a sexy stock, but the company appears to be executing
    on all cylinders and is attractively valued.

    than the SPX; while this is case at the moment, largely due to the volatile AMKR,
    swapping <place st="on">RIO</place> for RKT should decrease overall portfolio
    beta.

    this portfolio.  In this challenging market environment, the performance of these
    two stocks should set the tone for the early performance of this portfolio and
    dictate the size of any drawdowns which may need to be scaled to return the portfolio
    to the green.'

- en: Finally, I should probably have already explained that this portfolio is a long
    only equity portfolio.  It is not allowed to short stocks, buy or sell options,
    or avail itself of ETFs of any kind.  As a result, the system does not make an
    effort to hedge any positions, regardless of the market conditions.  The coming
    week should have a lot to say about how well this strategy is suited for the current
    market environment.
