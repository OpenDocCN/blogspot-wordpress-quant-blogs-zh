- en: When I [first announced](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html)
    that I would be using this space to talk about a live portfolio I was operating,
    I was [more than a little concerned](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html)
    that the timing might not be ideal and that I should wait for a possible market
    correction before I rolled out a new portfolio.  I based this opinion on my experience
    that the predecessor portfolios to A1 had demonstrated a greater propensity for
    outperforming the SPX benchmark in up markets than in down markets.  Perhaps I
    should have listened to my gut…

  zh: 当我[首次宣布](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html)我将在这里讨论一个我正在操作的实盘投资组合时，我[非常担心](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html)时机可能不理想，我应该等待可能的市場调整出来后再推出一个新的投资组合。我基于自己的经验，认为A1的前身投资组合在上涨市场中超越标普500基准的能力比在下跌市场中要强。也许我应该听从我的直觉…
- en: Well, whether we have that correction already in hand or are in the early stages
    of a more substantial bear market, it is time to drill down on the A1 portfolio.  As
    you can see from the attached equity curve below, A1’s performance has slipped
    below that of the SPX as a result of a week in which the five holdings were battered
    more severely than the indices.  Due to last week’s performance, the system’s
    ranking of <place st="on">RIO</place> (a favorite holding over the past two years
    or so) has dropped, triggering a sale.  <place st="on">RIO</place> has been replaced
    by RKT, a packaging company whose stock has tripled over the past year.  RKT sports
    a relatively modest P/E 16 for 2007 earnings and a 1.9 PEG that puts it well below
    the industry average.  In addition to a revenue growth story that is in sharp
    contrast to the industry trend, RKT has demonstrated continued pricing power it
    its markets.  This is not a sexy stock, but the company appears to be executing
    on all cylinders and is attractively valued.

  zh: 好吧，不管我们是否已经掌握了那种调整，或者正处于一个更大幅度的熊市早期的阶段，是时候深入研究A1投资组合了。正如下面附带的股票曲线所示，由于五个持仓在过去一周受到的打击比指数更严重，A1的表现已经滑落到了标普500指数以下。由于上周的表现，系统对<place
    st="on">RIO</place>（在过去两年左右一直是喜爱的持仓）的排名下降，触发了出售。<place st="on">RIO</place>被RKT所取代，后者是一家在过去一年内股票翻了三倍的包装公司。RKT拥有相对适度的2007年市盈率16和1.9的PEG，这使它远低于行业平均水平。除了收入增长的故事与行业趋势形成鲜明对比之外，RKT还证明了自己在其市场中有持续的定价权。这并不是一只性感的股票，但公司似乎在全力以赴，并且被认为是有吸引力的估值。
- en: A glance at the equity curve suggests that this portfolio has a higher beta
    than the SPX; while this is case at the moment, largely due to the volatile AMKR,
    swapping <place st="on">RIO</place> for RKT should decrease overall portfolio
    beta.

  zh: 股票曲线的一瞥表明，这个投资组合的贝塔值比标普500要高；虽然目前情况是这样，很大程度上是因为波动性较大的AMKR，但用RKT替换<place st="on">RIO</place>应该会降低投资组合的整体贝塔值。
- en: 'For the record, PCCC and AMKR are currently rated as the #1 and #2 stocks in
    this portfolio.  In this challenging market environment, the performance of these
    two stocks should set the tone for the early performance of this portfolio and
    dictate the size of any drawdowns which may need to be scaled to return the portfolio
    to the green.'

  zh: 记录在案，PCCC和AMKR目前被认为是我这个投资组合中的第一和第二股票。在这样一个充满挑战的市场环境中，这两只股票的表现应该会设定这个投资组合早期表现基调，并决定可能需要缩减的规模，以便将投资组合恢复到盈利状态。
- en: Finally, I should probably have already explained that this portfolio is a long
    only equity portfolio.  It is not allowed to short stocks, buy or sell options,
    or avail itself of ETFs of any kind.  As a result, the system does not make an
    effort to hedge any positions, regardless of the market conditions.  The coming
    week should have a lot to say about how well this strategy is suited for the current
    market environment.

  zh: 最后，我可能应该已经解释过，这个投资组合是一个只做多头股的股票投资组合。它不允许做空股票，买卖期权，或者利用任何类型的ETF。因此，系统不会努力对任何头寸进行对冲，无论市场条件如何。下周应该会说明这个策略是否适合当前的市场环境。
