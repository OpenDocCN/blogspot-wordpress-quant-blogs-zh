    clients to a target measure (VWAP is an example of this).  Execution algos focus
    on  how to execute size with the least amount of market impact and at the lowest
    cost (best price & transaction cost).

    signal generation (so if there any readers with suggestions please let me know).
       That said, here are some simple analyses I did on 1 year of tick data across
    2700 US equities;  Definitely gives me a better picture.

    on the next day and we enter at a price close to the prior close.   We now want
    to know when is the best point(s) to sell the position.   If the position has
    size, we may have to sell at multiple points during the day.**

- en: For very sharp close-to-close appreciation (> 2% return), the high is usually
    achieved in the last hour.  In the neutral case we see the high achieved in the
    first 1/2 of the day, with the most weight around 10:30\.   The medium returns
    (≤ 2%) seem to be more split between the opening and closing sessions (but otherwise
    pretty uniform).

    for a high return target.   The other return profiles show elevated probability
    of low in the morning session, but otherwise close to a uniform distribution.

- en: The extreme returns (> 2% in olive) and (< -2% in green) show 30-40% probability
    that the asset only spends 20% of the trading day on or above (below) the close,
    peaking in probability at 7-8% or maybe 1/2 hour of the day.   This is coincident
    with the time-of-high (low) behavior that we see above as well.

    groups of assets.   For instance the lower liquidity stocks with less frequent
    trading may have a very different profile.   I know that execution algo desks
    measure volume and other indicators on a per-asset basis, maybe with some grouping
    overlays.**
