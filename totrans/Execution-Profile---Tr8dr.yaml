    clients to a target measure (VWAP is an example of this).  Execution algos focus
    on  how to execute size with the least amount of market impact and at the lowest
    cost (best price & transaction cost).

       That said, here are some simple analyses I did on 1 year of tick data across
    2700 US equities;  Definitely gives me a better picture.

- en: For very sharp close-to-close appreciation (> 2% return), the high is usually
    achieved in the last hour.  In the neutral case we see the high achieved in the
    first 1/2 of the day, with the most weight around 10:30\.   The medium returns
    (≤ 2%) seem to be more split between the opening and closing sessions (but otherwise
    pretty uniform).

    for a high return target.   The other return profiles show elevated probability
    of low in the morning session, but otherwise close to a uniform distribution.

- en: The extreme returns (> 2% in olive) and (< -2% in green) show 30-40% probability
    that the asset only spends 20% of the trading day on or above (below) the close,
    peaking in probability at 7-8% or maybe 1/2 hour of the day.   This is coincident
    with the time-of-high (low) behavior that we see above as well.

- en: I suspect that there are differences in price movement profiles for different
    groups of assets.   For instance the lower liquidity stocks with less frequent
    trading may have a very different profile.   I know that execution algo desks
    measure volume and other indicators on a per-asset basis, maybe with some grouping
    overlays.**
