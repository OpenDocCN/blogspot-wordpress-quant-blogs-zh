- en: I have a general methodological question. I noticed all your tests are frictionless,
    is there a reason for this? I realize presenting frictionless results has value,
    but so does presenting with friction, as many edges disappear or radically erode
    with friction. I’ll go further and say that a frictionless result does not even
    prove price anomaly in the academic sense (EMT definition of price anomaly). Interested
    to hear your take on why not present both results.
