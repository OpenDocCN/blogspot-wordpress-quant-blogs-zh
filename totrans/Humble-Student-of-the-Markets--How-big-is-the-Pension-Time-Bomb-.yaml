    than public plans, but often they were starting from more-optimistic assumptions.
    Pension plans at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index have trimmed
    expected returns by one-half of a percentage point over the past five years, but
    their average return assumption is also 8%, according to the Analyst's Accounting
    Observer, a research firm.

    bond asset mix. Let's be generous and say that the bond market can return 3%.
    That comes to a long-term equity return assumption of 11.3%, or an equity risk
    premium of 8.3%!

    time bomb story. As interest rates have fallen, the net present value of pension
    liabilities rise, but return assumptions have fallen enough and a big yawning
    pension gap is the result. Moreover, the historical experience shows that an equity
    risk premium of 8.3% is, shall we say, a tad high.

    World Order: Unstable Risk Premiums: Implications for Practice](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1669398)by
    Aswath Damodaran of NYU. Here is the abstract: > Investors have to be offered
    risk premiums to invest in risky assets. These risk premiums take different forms
    in different asset markets: equity risk premiums (ERP) in stock markets, default
    spreads in bond markets and real asset premiums in other asset markets. These
    premiums have their roots in fundamentals and will vary as a function of uncertainty
    about the economy, the risk aversion of investors, information uncertainty and
    fear of catastrophe, among other factors. In practice, analysts in developed markets
    have generally looked backwards to estimate risk premiums, using historical data
    to arrive at their estimates. Implicitly, they assume that historical averages
    are not only precise but also that risk premiums are stable and revert back quickly
    to historical norms. In this paper, we present evidence that risk premiums in
    equity, bond and real asset markets are not only imprecise, but are also unstable
    and linked across markets. We present estimation approaches that are more in line
    with dynamic, shifting risk premiums. We argue that the resulting estimates can
    help use make more informed asset allocation and asset valuation judgments in
    portfolio management and better investment, financing and dividend decisions in
    corporate finance.'

    school and actuarial students have been taught Modern Portfolio Theory, or MPT.
    It is an investment theory that tries to maximize expected return for a given
    level of risk by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets in a portfolio.
    Harry Markowitz, who earned a Nobel Prize in Economics for the theory, modern
    portfolio theory introduced the idea of diversification as a tool to lower the
    risk of the entire portfolio without giving up high returns.

    – risk and return. In practice, most investors estimate returns for stocks using
    an equity risk premium using the following procedure: Historically, stocks have
    returned X% over bonds. Bond yields are currently Y%, therefore we can expect
    a return of X + Y for stocks.'

    concluded that historical data studies indicate that estimates of asset class
    risk premiums don't really mean revert to long-term averages and they are unstable
    in the short and long run.

    he build a portfolio? Damodaran suggests that investors should look to market
    based indicators. Consider the bond default spread as a signal of equity risk
    appetite and realized vs. estimated risk as another indicator, e.g. realized vs.
    implied volatility embedded in equity option markets around the world.
