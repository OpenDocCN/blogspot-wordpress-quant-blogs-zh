# Falkenblog: Modern Politics as Religion

Over at Cafe Hayek, Don Boudreaux

[notes](http://cafehayek.com/2012/08/i-believe.html)

this snippet from our President:

> Some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics. A lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders. You have every right to be. But despite all of this, I ask of you what has been asked of Americans throughout our history. I ask you to believe.

That one could say this good faith assertion reflects a profound mysticism sharply at odds with the otherwise anti-religious nature of the left.
