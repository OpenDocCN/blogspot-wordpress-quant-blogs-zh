- en: Bill Miller’s Legg Mason Value Trust (LMVTX) has had a great long-term track
    record that would be the envy of most managers. Unfortunately the fund lagged
    the S&P 500 in 2006 and it looks like it will lag again in 2007, barring a last
    minute recovery.

- en: Using the techniques shown in the sidebar titled *Reverse engineering a manager's
    macro exposures*, I estimated his style (Value/Growth) exposures. Despite the
    “value” label in LMVTX, Miller has long been thought of as tilting towards the
    Growth style (remember his big holdings in AOL in the fund?) However the fund
    has tilted more towards the Value style and has tended to outperform when Value
    outperforms Growth and underperformed when Growth outperforms Value.
