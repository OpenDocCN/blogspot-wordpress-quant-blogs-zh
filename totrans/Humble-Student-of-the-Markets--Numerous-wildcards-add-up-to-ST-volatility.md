# Humble Student of the Markets: Numerous wildcards add up to ST volatility

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/01/numerous-wildcards-add-up-to-st.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/01/numerous-wildcards-add-up-to-st.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 17-Jan-2024)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### A time for caution

As the S&P 500 tests the 4900 level, it faces a number of key technical, top-down macro and fundamental challenges. These challenges are wildcards to the near-term path of stock prices and form the potential for volatility in the coming week.

From a technical perspective, some caution is warranted. We recently highlighted a short-term buy signal when NYSE McClellan Oscillator (NYMO) recycled from oversold to neutral. The “take profits” tripwire for this trading signal occurs when NYMO reaches a positive reading, which occurred last Thursday. If you were tactically long the market, it’s time to reduce risk. Don’t try to be a hero.
