    sold off in dramatic fashion last week, with critical technical support levels
    failing to hold in a number of key indices, including the tech heavy [NASDAQ Composite](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24COMPQ)
    and [NASDAQ 100](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24NDX), as well as
    the small cap [Russell 2000](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24RUT).  For
    a change, the damage in tech stocks was greater than it was in the SPX, where
    financials continue to be the [most highly weighted sector](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/500factsheet.pdf).

    even when one focuses on the volatility index of the hard hit NASDAQ 100, the
    [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN).  In terms of the VIX,
    the reaction has also been comparatively mild.  Last week the VIX rose 3.20 points
    (15.4%) to 23.94.  While this is the highest end of week close in six weeks, an
    SPX drop of 4.5% typically triggers a rise of about 19% in the VIX, so a 15.4%
    rise has to be considered a lackluster move relative to market conditions.

    dropped only to -3, suggest a slight mean reverting bias going forward.

    markets, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/) sums
    up the week that was and the week that will be in his [Linkfest 2008 Review/Preview](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/01/linkfest-2008.html).

    or more in the VIX has only happened six time since 9/11 – and the last five of
    those have seen the VIX fall in the subsequent week.  After two weeks of 12.3%
    and 15.4% gains, I would not be surprised to see the VIX pull back a little in
    the coming week.

    the best know barberas, [Barbera d’Asti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbera_d%27Asti)
    and Barbera d’Alba, it is fruity, highly drinkable version of this wine from the
    [Sierra Foothills](http://www.foothillwine.com/) that recently tickled my fancy:
    the 2005 [Renwood](http://www.renwood.com/) Sierra Series barbera. If you are
    looking for a different varietal to add to your list of everyday reds, seek this
    one out. For only $9 at my local wine store, it’s a bargain and a great change
    of pace.**'
