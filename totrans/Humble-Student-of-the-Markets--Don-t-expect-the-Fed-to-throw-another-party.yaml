- en: Last year, Ben Bernanke made a speech at Jackson Hole announcing the start of
    the Fed's QE2 program, which kicked off a stock market rally. (The Fed throws
    great parties, don't they?) This year, there seems to be a certain level of market
    expectation that we may see another Jackson Hole surprise.

    who was one of the advocates of QE2 last year, clarified the FOMC statement that
    interest rates would stay low for another two years is not a signal for QE3 to
    start.

    to grow at a moderate pace through the second half of the year,” Bullard said
    late yesterday in a telephone interview. “If the economy is substantially weaker
    than expected, we could take more action, especially if it was coupled with a
    renewed deflation risk.”'

    and a Fed showing reluctance to be more accommodative than they are today. On
    top of that, we have European banking system and sovereigns lurching from crisis
    to crisis. (What's the over/under these days the for number of days before another
    European "problem" erupts? 2 days? 3 days?)
