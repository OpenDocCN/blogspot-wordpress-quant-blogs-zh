# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Update for 3/25/07

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/portfolio-a1-update-for-32507.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/portfolio-a1-update-for-32507.html#0001-01-01)

Portfolio A1 rallied vigorously last week and now leads the benchmark SPX by 1.7%.  Four of the five holdings (all but NTY) are within 3% of their 52 week highs, with <state st="on"><place st="on">TEX</place></state> logging a new all-time high on Friday.

There are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

Though I am still not sure of the significance, the equity curve continues to strongly resemble a [duck](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/canary-or-canard_09.html), although as portfolio performance improves I am ever hopeful that we can fly out of range of [Dick Cheney](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/12/cheney/).

(On a distantly related note, I am pleased to report that I have moved in to the top 5,000 at the [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://contests.cnbc.com/milliondollar/contestmain.do). I am currently in the top 2% of all contestants for this challenge, using a discretionary trading system that has recently made strong gains in natural gas and copper. My goal is to be comfortably in the top 1% and taking a run at the money when the contest ends on May 14\. I will pass along any news of interest as it develops.)

Portfolio details for Portfolio A1 are as follows:
