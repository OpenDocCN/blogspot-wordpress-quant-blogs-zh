    Fannie and Freddie, this 150 bp is a riskless profit. As the blog [Accrued Interest](http://accruedint.blogspot.com/2008/10/empire-doesnt-seen-leverage-as-any.html)
    has pointed out, one reason this riskless profit exists is hedge fund deleveraging:
    nobody has the risk appetite to arbitrage this spread at a meaningful scale. [](http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/10/25/one-easy-thing-china-could-do-to-help-stabilize-global-markets-buy-agencies/)'

    a blogger at the Council of Foreign Relations, suggests that the Chinese government,
    who does have a lot of cash to benefit from this high yield, should go ahead and
    buy up these agencies debt. However, if you read the Chinese blogs and online
    comments, there is enormous internal pressure for the government to spend some
    of this money on infrastructure projects, social security, health care, etc.,
    so I doubt that the Chinese government will have stabilizing the US mortgage market
    at the top of its agenda. As a result, arbitrageurs out there should have no fear
    that this opportunity will disappear any time soon.'
