    I''ve noticed in your blog that you comment a lot about economists still preaching
    unlimited growth, etc.  Beijer economists would sharply disagree and they go after
    such naive economists. As you can see many of the Beijer Fellows are top dogs
    in the profession, e.g. Kenneth Arrow not only won the Nobel at an extremely early
    age but is widely recognized as probably the best economist next to Keynes of
    this century. Partha Dasgupta is also one of the world''s very best economists
    and has done lots of work with Maler and Arrow on sustainable growth where "growth"
    is defined sensibly.  GNP is mostly used by politicians and its inadequacies as
    a sensible measure of "growth" was exposed long long ago, e.g. by Nordhaus and
    Jim Tobin in their proposed measure promoted in the 70''s."'

    at a conference in Brussels last year. I believe Sutter's background is economics,
    but he writes beautifully and moves with elegance and ease from physics to classical
    philosophy to politics and art, and is as fun to read as he is convincing. He
    also gives a very useful potted history of theories of growth, from which I learned
    quite a lot. Andrew makes two very general important points.

    in with the drama of markets and competition that took over our public discourse
    just as anti-Communism was becoming moot. There is also the conventional wisdom
    that growth is necessary to maintain pension systems as the Baby Boomers retire
    (though, just as with other types of government revenue, maybe contributions and
    collections are more directly relevant). And news about growth, at both the corporate
    and national levels, supplies shots of optimism and fear to rank-and-file investors
    in financial markets, allowing the professionals to rake in much more money than
    is at stake in real goods and services.

    trend gives birth to new start-ups upon which to gamble. On a mythological level,

- en: 'The second important point Andrew makes is that a deep cause of our trouble
    to think about growth clearly is the distortion of the concept of value in economics.
    We''ve become accustomed to thinking, for example, that innovation is by its nature
    good; this is at least how it is measured in GDP. Medicines for children? Automatic
    weapons for dictators? Doesn''t matter: both count positively towards GDP. We
    have more or less ceased talking seriously about the differences between good
    and bad innovations. But of course some innovations are better than others, regardless
    of how crude measures such as GDP may tally up their value. Andrew in his paper
    suggests how we might start growing a different perspective, derived in part from
    ideas going back to Aristotle. Absolutely brilliant.'

  zh: 安德鲁提出的第二个重要观点是，我们清晰思考增长难题的深刻原因之一，是经济学中价值概念的扭曲。我们已经习惯于认为，例如，创新本质上是有益的；至少在GDP的衡量中是这样。儿童药物？独裁者的自动武器？无关紧要：这两者都在GDP上计入正面影响。我们差不多已经不再严肃地讨论好的创新和坏的创新之间的区别。但是当然，有些创新比其他的要好，不管GDP这样的粗略指标如何计算它们的价值。安德鲁在他的论文中提出了我们可能如何开始培养不同的视角，部分源自追溯到亚里士多德的思想。真是太棒了。
