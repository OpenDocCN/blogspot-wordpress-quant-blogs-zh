    -- in the absence of any ultimate limits to economic growth continuing indefinitely
    into the future. It is my impression that economists generally find such talk
    irritating, perhaps because the discussion of limits naturally involves considering
    factors from physics or biology, thereby taking the discussion outside of the
    realm of pure economics. Peruse the comments on posts such as

    that all economists react this way. Indeed, I suspect that there is a rapid change
    going on in the economics profession and that many economists are busy reassessing
    earlier views and taking the idea of limits very seriously. Two things to mention
    here. First, in email correspondence, economist William Brock of the University
    of Wisconsin suggested to me that many economists do indeed take biologically
    founded limits to growth seriously and try hard to argue down those who would
    dismiss them so casually. He mentioned, in particular, the

    and worry about the serious limits on economic growth imposed by a finite Earth. 
    I''ve noticed in your blog that you comment a lot about economists still preaching
    unlimited growth, etc.  Beijer economists would sharply disagree and they go after
    such naive economists. As you can see many of the Beijer Fellows are top dogs
    in the profession, e.g. Kenneth Arrow not only won the Nobel at an extremely early
    age but is widely recognized as probably the best economist next to Keynes of
    this century. Partha Dasgupta is also one of the world''s very best economists
    and has done lots of work with Maler and Arrow on sustainable growth where "growth"
    is defined sensibly.  GNP is mostly used by politicians and its inadequacies as
    a sensible measure of "growth" was exposed long long ago, e.g. by Nordhaus and
    Jim Tobin in their proposed measure promoted in the 70''s."'

    also that young economists in particular will increasingly think for themselves,
    read widely outside of economics, and get past the naive ideas of unlimited growth
    as expressed in Paul Romer's endogenous growth theory of 1990 and variations thereof.

    at a conference in Brussels last year. I believe Sutter's background is economics,
    but he writes beautifully and moves with elegance and ease from physics to classical
    philosophy to politics and art, and is as fun to read as he is convincing. He
    also gives a very useful potted history of theories of growth, from which I learned
    quite a lot. Andrew makes two very general important points.

    ideological struggles of the Cold War, and the need to employ the "baby boom"
    generation born in the first decade of peace. What's keeping them alive a half-century
    later, particularly in countries that are already wealthy?

    in with the drama of markets and competition that took over our public discourse
    just as anti-Communism was becoming moot. There is also the conventional wisdom
    that growth is necessary to maintain pension systems as the Baby Boomers retire
    (though, just as with other types of government revenue, maybe contributions and
    collections are more directly relevant). And news about growth, at both the corporate
    and national levels, supplies shots of optimism and fear to rank-and-file investors
    in financial markets, allowing the professionals to rake in much more money than
    is at stake in real goods and services.

    of nature. On a practical level, this dream serves the rationales mentioned above:
    countries compete to be the "most innovative;" "productivity improvements" are
    sought to allow aging populations to maintain GDP growth; and every technology
    trend gives birth to new start-ups upon which to gamble. On a mythological level,
    the dream is both the *deus* (or at least *Titan*) *ex machina* to clean up the
    messes caused by prior years of growth and technological interventions (e.g.,
    Bush 2002), and an expression of our deepest nature (Phelps 2009).'

    to think about growth clearly is the distortion of the concept of value in economics.
    We''ve become accustomed to thinking, for example, that innovation is by its nature
    good; this is at least how it is measured in GDP. Medicines for children? Automatic
    weapons for dictators? Doesn''t matter: both count positively towards GDP. We
    have more or less ceased talking seriously about the differences between good
    and bad innovations. But of course some innovations are better than others, regardless
    of how crude measures such as GDP may tally up their value. Andrew in his paper
    suggests how we might start growing a different perspective, derived in part from
    ideas going back to Aristotle. Absolutely brilliant.'
