    the near future, right? Not so fast. Notice how NYSE volume rose over the prior
    day on both Wednesday and Thursday. Higher volume on up days is supposedly a good
    thing. So let’s break it down further.

    the price pattern from strongly negative to solidly positive. This is an example
    of why traders should not simply look at price in a vacuum.
