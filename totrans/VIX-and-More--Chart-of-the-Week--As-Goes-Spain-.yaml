- en: Two years ago today, in [Spain rallies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/spain-rallies.html),
    I posted a chart of the Spanish ETF, [EWP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWP),
    that showed EWP had rallied off of a bottom and looked like it was poised for
    a bullish breakout.

- en: Two years later, I still believe that Spain is the most important line in the
    sand that euro zone leaders have to grapple with and the country whose fate is
    probably most intertwined with the future of the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro).

- en: The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below shows weekly bars of EWP going back five years. The dominant feature in
    this chart is the financial crisis of 2008-2009\. Various iterations of the euro
    zone crisis can be identified in the bottoms in June 2010, September 2011, November
    2011, etc. EWP was in a gradual downtrend from April 2011 to March 2012, but fell
    sharply until the beginning of June. The most recent bounce in the Spanish ETF
    still looks somewhat tentative on the charts and is likely to be tested in the
    weeks and months ahead.

- en: As concerning as the equity situation looks in Spain, the country’s [credit
    default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)
    (just 8% off of their all-time highs at 578) and yields on sovereign debt (yields
    on the 10-year bond are 5% below their all-time highs at 6.95%) indicate an even
    greater degree of financial stress.

    [France](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/France) to find their way
    back into the crosshairs of traders who are looking to capitalize on euro zone
    angst, but as far as I am concerned, Spain will continue to the most critical
    line in the sand.
