    of events happen to me today. I’m not sure they mean anything, but I thought I’d
    pass them along for posterity and the remote possibility that it may be of service
    to someone else further on down the line.'

    boredom, I decided to drop in the [Market Rewind chat room](http://chatroll.com/market-rewind/embed),
    which is hosted daily by Jeff Pietsch of [Market Rewind](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/).

    blurted out that I was “just on Bloomberg.” I assumed he meant some sort of mention
    in an article on [Bloomberg.com](http://www.bloomberg.com/), but it turns out
    he was referring to [Bloomberg TV](http://www.bloomberg.com/media/tv/). Now I
    know I had not been out of the house all morning and had not even been on the
    phone, so this made me fairly curious. When I was unable to pull up anything on
    the Bloomberg TV web site, it occurred to me that the previous night I might have
    flipped on Bloomberg Asia before going to sleep. While I don’t know all the nuances
    of TiVo, I do know that even if you turn of the television, the last half hour
    or so of programming for whatever station you were watching is stored in a buffer.
    Perhaps my wife had not turned on the TV and changed the channel today…

    *VIX and More* as well as the [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)
    in a short segment about the possibility of a correction in stocks. Specifically,
    Lothery picked up on the theme of Monday’s post, [SPX 15% Over 200 Day Moving
    Average for First Time in Ten Years](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/spx-15-over-200-day-moving-average-for.html)
    and used a recent chart of the SPX and the [200 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    to highlight the widening gap between the two.

    has been referenced on any of the major financial television stations.

    the multiple attributions and very positive tone of the Bloomberg segment was
    in sharp contrast to the almost comically confrontational approach CNBC has taken
    to bloggers.

    in today’s electronic fishing net, particularly if you have TiVo and can make
    a good guess at which channel might snare what you are looking for.
