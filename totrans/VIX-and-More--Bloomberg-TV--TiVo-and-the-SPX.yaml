- en: While I am decidedly not a chat room person, in the heat of today’s trading
    boredom, I decided to drop in the [Market Rewind chat room](http://chatroll.com/market-rewind/embed),
    which is hosted daily by Jeff Pietsch of [Market Rewind](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/).

  zh: 虽然我绝对不是聊天室的人，但在今天交易的激烈无聊中，我决定加入[市场回放聊天室](http://chatroll.com/market-rewind/embed)，该聊天室由[市场回放](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/)的杰夫·皮特施每天主持。
- en: I couldn’t have been in the chat room for more than a minute or two when someone
    blurted out that I was “just on Bloomberg.” I assumed he meant some sort of mention
    in an article on [Bloomberg.com](http://www.bloomberg.com/), but it turns out
    he was referring to [Bloomberg TV](http://www.bloomberg.com/media/tv/). Now I
    know I had not been out of the house all morning and had not even been on the
    phone, so this made me fairly curious. When I was unable to pull up anything on
    the Bloomberg TV web site, it occurred to me that the previous night I might have
    flipped on Bloomberg Asia before going to sleep. While I don’t know all the nuances
    of TiVo, I do know that even if you turn of the television, the last half hour
    or so of programming for whatever station you were watching is stored in a buffer.
    Perhaps my wife had not turned on the TV and changed the channel today…

  zh: 我在聊天室里不超过两分钟，就有人突然说我在“彭博社”。我以为他是在[彭博社.com](http://www.bloomberg.com/)的一篇文章中提到我，但结果他是指[彭博电视](http://www.bloomberg.com/media/tv/)。现在我知道我整个上午都没有离开过房子，甚至没有接过电话，这让我非常好奇。当我无法在彭博电视网站上找到任何东西时，我想到前一天晚上我可能在睡前打开了彭博亚洲。虽然我不了解TiVo的所有细微差别，但我知道即使你关掉电视，你观看的最后半小时左右的节目都会存储在缓冲区里。也许我妻子今天没有打开电视换台…
- en: So, I dashed upstairs and sure enough, found that Brennan Lothery had mentioned
    *VIX and More* as well as the [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)
    in a short segment about the possibility of a correction in stocks. Specifically,
    Lothery picked up on the theme of Monday’s post, [SPX 15% Over 200 Day Moving
    Average for First Time in Ten Years](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/spx-15-over-200-day-moving-average-for.html)
    and used a recent chart of the SPX and the [200 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    to highlight the widening gap between the two.

  zh: 于是我飞奔楼上，果然发现布伦南·洛瑟里提到了*VIX和更多*以及[通讯](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)在一段关于股票可能出现调整的简短节目中。具体来说，洛瑟里抓住了周一帖子[SPX
    15%超过10年来的200天移动平均线](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/spx-15-over-200-day-moving-average-for.html)的主题，并使用了一张最近SPX和[200天简单移动平均线](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)的图表，突出了两者之间的差距。
- en: To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time any *VIX and More* analysis
    has been referenced on any of the major financial television stations.

- en: Adam at [Daily Options Report](http://www.dailyoptionsreport.com/) noted how
    the multiple attributions and very positive tone of the Bloomberg segment was
    in sharp contrast to the almost comically confrontational approach CNBC has taken
    to bloggers.

    a good guess at which channel might snare what you are looking for.
