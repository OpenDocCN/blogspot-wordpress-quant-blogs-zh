- en: The quality of stories has a direct correlation to the quality of the software
    in my view.  Lots of people struggle with story writing.  If the stories are low
    grade, and the Product Owner happens to be sitting next door to the team, and
    the team are “talking” this may not be so much of an issue.  However, in many
    cases the Product Owner isn’t always available 24×7.

- en: One interesting exercise it to leverage Google Docs or similar to allow remote
    pairing whilst writing stories – even if the pair is close by.  The advantage
    of this is that with less conversation, and more concentration on the words of
    the [story](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_shrinking_story.html),
    a clearer story emerges which aid understanding and clarity of the business value. 
    Take this a step further, and effectively the gate for a successful story is that
    it should relay value when read by an individual that isn’t part of the agile
    team.

    Return On Investment (ROI) around the “[achieve some goal](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_shrinking_story.html)”
    part of the story, which is often forgotten by teams
