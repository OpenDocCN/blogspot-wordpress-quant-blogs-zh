- en: High-frequency trading (HFT) has been the subject of much hubbub across the
    blogosphere (and just recently [mainstream media](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24trading.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=high%20frequency&st=cse))
    lately, stoked by the combo of Tyler Durden from [Zero Hedge](http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/)
    on the investigative side and Joseph Saluzzi from [Themis Trading](http://www.themistrading.com)
    on the institutional agency broker side. No doubt buy-side agency brokers and
    their their [NBBO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_best_bid_and_offer)–
    and [VWAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VWAP)-pegged execution algos are getting
    killed by the HFT guys.

    this month. Much more interesting is reading actual [FIX](http://www.fixprotocol.org/)
    support for flash orders by the exchanges, as they become available. For example,
    [BATS](http://www.batstrading.com) [announced](http://www.batstrading.com/alerts/release_notes/)
    on May 26 support for BOLT orders (see the [BATS FIX spec](http://www.batstrading.com/resources/membership/BATS_FIX_Specification.pdf)
    for more details, such as Page 13 in bold). Relevant for this discussion is the
    following snippet from the BOLT announcement (other exchanges have equivalent):'

- en: After removing the marketable liquidity on the BATS order book, BOLT Routing
    will first expose an order to BATS Members for up to 25 milliseconds before routing
    to away markets. BOLT Routing offers users the opportunity to fill during the
    exposure period and collect a $.0015 per share rebate on a routable order rather
    than pay the standard routing fee.

    observe BOLT orders 25 ms in advance of routing to an away market, which is otherwise
    invisible to everyone else (either until it is posted at the destination, or forever
    if the order is processed by the available book at the destination)

    due to the sub-500 ms exemption in the Reg NMS Quote and Limit Display Rules (Rules

    / [604](http://content.lawyerlinks.com/library/sec/sec_rules/reg_nms/17cfr242_604.htm)),
    this does offer wonderful advance knowledge to BATS members.

    is an interesting quantivity-style problem.
