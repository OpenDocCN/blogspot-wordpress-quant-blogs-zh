# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't forget about the intermediate-term trend

**Mid-week market update**

: I wrote on Monday (see

[Everything but the kitchen sink](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2022/02/14/everything-but-the-kitchen-sink/)

) that market sentiment was overly stretched on the downside, "If you are short here, you need a catastrophe within the next 10 days, otherwise, you run the risk of a rip-your-face-off relief rally."

The relief rally appeared right on cue on Turnaround Tuesday and prices stabilized today in the wake of the release of the FOMC minutes. Before the bulls get too excited, don't forget that the intermediate trend is still down. The Value Line Geometric Index, which measures the performance of the average stock, broke a long-term support level and is tracing out a falling channel.
