    came in very low. It was the lowest volume in over 2 weeks. Below are some tests
    which demonstrate the potential importance of this.

    and 60% and the average gains days 1-3 were between 0.1% and 0.275%.

    winners were between 68% and 76% and the average gains days 1-3 were between 0.59%
    and 0.94%. The reliability of a bounce occurring at some point in the 3 day period
    increased from 75% to 87%.
