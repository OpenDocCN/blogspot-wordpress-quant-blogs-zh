    question a few keystrokes.

    in which it spiked up 30% or more.  Turn the clock back to 1990 and you find a
    total of 8 days.

- en: For those who might be interested, the mean reversion expectations following
    a +30% move are very similar to that of +20% days, which I [weighed in on](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-day-20-spikes-in-vix.html)
    this morning.  The data sample size is small enough to not be statistically significant,
    but still, in the 3, 5 and 10 days following the VIX spikes, 6/8, 7/8 and 5/8
    of the VIX moves had reversed.  The mean retracements were 9% and 11% over the
    3 and 5 day period, but 10 days out, the mean move had continued upward 4%, owing
    largely to the strength of one subsequent 52% spike in the VIX.

    the [Fed’s decision to raise interest rates](http://www.federalreserve.gov/FOMC/19940204default.htm)
    sent shock waves through the markets.
