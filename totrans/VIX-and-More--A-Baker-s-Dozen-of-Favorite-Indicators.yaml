    the currency of frequent flier miles over the [Dow Jones Transportation Average](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24tran)
    itself, I used to spend a lot of time consulting in the area of business strategy
    development.  During this period, much of my energy was focused on the creation
    of strategic objectives and a corresponding set of [metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrics)
    that would help to determine how well those objectives were being met and how
    likely the were to be achieved in the coming quarters.  The work was a roughly
    even mixture of art and science that attempted to capture the complexity of a
    business, yet reduce it to about 12-15 metrics.  Experience proved that less than
    a dozen or so metrics invariably meant that important components of the strategic
    plan would fall through the cracks, while more than 15 metrics usually translated
    into a management team that was not properly focused and thinking about strategic
    priorities.'

    keep things simple and have an uncluttered cockpit that still tells you everything
    you need to know to make it from point A to point B, you increase your chances
    of success.

- en: Last week, [a reader asked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-highs-and-new-lows-for-market.html)
    what my favorite market indicators are and it got me to thinking how I should
    be able to trade with only 12-15 indicators instead of the 25-30 that it seems
    I am always trying to pay attention to.

    all the other indicators that I use, but at a very minimum I urge all to prioritize
    their top dozen or so indicators and come up with some ideas about which ones
    to lean on most heavily when they are providing conflicting information and/or
    the markets are most volatile.
