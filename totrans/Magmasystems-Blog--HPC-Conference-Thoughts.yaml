- en: Yesterday's HPC On Wall Street conference could be summed up in one word ....
    PACKED! I thought that this would be a sleepy little conference, with a few crazy
    architects from a few IBs and hedge funds walking around. When I got there, I
    could not even move through the (very narrow) aisles that the vendors were set
    up in. I would guess that there must have been 700-800 people at this conference,
    and it is at these times that I am thankful that I am not a lightweight, as I
    merrily tossed my compatriots all over the Roosevelt Hotel in my quest to get
    to the conference rooms.

  zh: 昨天的“华尔街高性能计算”会议可以用一个词来概括 .... 爆满！我以为这将是一个昏昏欲睡的小型会议，一些来自几家投行和对冲基金的疯狂架构师走来走去。当我到达那里时，我甚至无法穿过供应商所在的（非常狭窄）过道。我猜这次会议可能有700-800人，在这种时候，我很庆幸自己不是那种轻量级的人物，因为我愉快地把我的同伴们扔到罗斯福酒店的各个角落，以便到达会议室。
- en: The two panels that I went to were, unfortunately, complete wastes of time.
    Even some of the panelists that I spoke to afterwards were half-embarassed to
    be on the folically-challenged panels. (I am still wondering what Gideon Low from
    Gemstone was doing up there in the session on Multicores and Market Data .. although
    he DID manage to come up with better answers than the Chief Architect of Fidelity!).
    It only reinforces my opinion that if you are doing something unique and important,
    your company will never let you speak about it on a panel!

  zh: 我参加的两个研讨会，不幸的是，完全是浪费时间。甚至有些与我交谈的评论家也为能在秃顶的研讨会上发言而感到尴尬。（我仍在想吉迪恩·洛（Gideon Low）
    from Gemstone在多核和市场数据研讨会上做什么 .... 尽管他确实设法提出比富达首席架构师更好的答案！）这进一步加深了我的看法，如果你正在做一些独特和重要的事情，你的公司永远也不会让你在研讨会上发言！
- en: And, thanks to the people from Bear Stearns, who during our lunch with a vendor,
    planted themselves at our lunch table and managed to kill our conversations.

- en: I was heartened to see a constant flow of traffic at the Digipede booth. In
    several square meters, you could talk to Microsoft (CCS), Digipede, and Platform
    (who were displaying at the IBM booth). I was disappointed to see one CEP vendor
    there (Aleri).

  zh: 我很高兴看到Digipede展位前一直有络绎不绝的客流。在几平方米的地方，你可以见到微软（CCS）、Digipede和Platform（他们在IBM展位展示）。我失望地看到一家CEP供应商在那里（Aleri）。
- en: The most interesting new player was STAC, who purports to be an "independent"
    kind of lab, where both vendors and customers can go to in order to get evaluations
    and benchmarking done .... sort of like a Consumer Reports magazine. One interesting
    comment from them was that, in their early experience, some of the claims about
    feature sets that various vendors make do not actually hold up when it came time
    to implement the vendors' products. An independent lab for the securities industry
    is long overdue, and it is heartening to see vendors contribute hardware to STAC
    in order to "bootstrap" their operations. The two main guys from STAC are ex-Reuters
    guys, and so you know that they have good experience in market data systems.

  zh: 最有趣的新参与者是STAC，它自称是一个“独立”的实验室，供应商和客户都可以去那里进行评估和基准测试……就像一本《消费者报告》杂志。他们的一条有趣评论是，在他们早期的经验中，一些供应商声称的功能集实际上在实施供应商产品的时候并没有站住脚。证券行业的一个独立实验室早就应该出现了，看到供应商贡献硬件给STAC以“启动”他们的运营，令人鼓舞。STAC的两位主要人物是前路透社的人，所以你知道他们在市场数据系统方面有丰富的经验。
- en: There were some real small players (like RTI in the messaging space) who might
    be ripe for joint ventures or investment. Seeing these guys work the floor reminded
    me of my days as a software vendors going exhibiting at shows ... an absolutely
    exhausting experience.

  zh: 有一些真正的小角色（如消息传递领域的RTI）可能适合进行合资或投资。看到这些家伙在展会上辛勤奔波，让我想起了我作为软件供应商参加展览的日子 ... 绝对是一种令人筋疲力尽的经历。
- en: My colleagues have told me that the HPC show has grown exponentially over the
    past four years .... if I grows any more, then the Roosevelt Hotel is going to
    have to abandon the cattle car approach, or else, I am going to have to put on
    a few more pounds!

  zh: 我的同事告诉我，过去四年里HPC展览会的规模已经呈指数级增长......如果它继续增长，那么罗斯福酒店可能不得不放弃使用牛车接送的方式，否则，我可能得增重几磅！
