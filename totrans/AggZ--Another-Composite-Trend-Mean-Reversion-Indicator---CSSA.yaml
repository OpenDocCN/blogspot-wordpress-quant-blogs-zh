    the AggZ is a composite trend and mean-reversion indicator rolled into one. The
    concept of both is to anchor a long term trending measure to a short-term mean-reverting
    measure so that you can have an indicator that can be traded for both long and
    short-term intervals. The AggZ did 20% CAGR over the last 2000 bars on the CAGR
    using dividend adjusted data on the SPY. The calculation is dead simple:'
