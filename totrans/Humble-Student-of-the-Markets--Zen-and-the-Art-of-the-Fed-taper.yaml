    expand the pace of asset purchases, and is instead every inclination to end the
    program. They are looking forward to normalizing policy by shifting the focus

- en: 'Bottom Line: Policymakers would like to normalize policy by moving away from
    asset purchases to interest rates. Emphasizing forward guidance is part of that
    process. Incoming research suggests not only that threshold based forward guidance
    is effective, but has room to be even more effective. That should be a comfort
    to policymakers who worry that ending asset purchases will excessively tighten
    financial conditions; they have a tool to change the mix of policy while leaving
    the level of accommodation unchanged. Whether they use it or not is another question.
    There has clearly been some discomfort among policymakers regarding changing the
    unemployment threshold. This suggests it would not necessarily be an immediate
    replacement for ending asset purchases. That said, it is difficult to see how
    the current threshold is meaningful at all if the Fed is still purchasing assets
    when the threshold is breached. Indeed, the current low level of unemployment
    relative to the threshold, combined with clear indications that the Fed has no
    intention of raising rates anytime soon, argues by itself that a change in the
    thresholds is a likely scenario in the months ahead.'

    (EM) rebounded strongly. But this relief rally has now stalled, as investors are
    cautious about the central bank’s next move (see chart). Indeed the latest FOMC
    meeting confirmed the Fed’s bias for tapering and the very good employment report
    released last Friday reinforces our economists’ expectation of a March 2014 taper.
    The threat of rising global yields is a key downside risk for EM assets near term.
    Higher bond yields should trigger portfolio rebalancing and the “repricing of
    risk could spark a run by investors holding speculative positions”, says the IMF.
    The shock will be further amplified in countries with external imbalances and
    vulnerable financial systems.

    which could mean keeping rates down longer. Fed staff research suggests the economy
    and job market might grow faster, without much additional risk of inflation, if
    the Fed promised to keep rates near zero until the unemployment rate gets as low
    as 5.5%. Goldman Sachs economists predict the Fed will lower the threshold to
    6% as early as December and reduce the bond-buying program at the same time.

    the Fed reduces the rate of growth of its balance sheet? My gut reaction is no
    - that risk premiums would rise, largely because that form of guidance only serves
    to hold down interest rates and does little to direct affect the risk premium
    between mortgage rates and Treasury yields. But then, I have been wrong before.
