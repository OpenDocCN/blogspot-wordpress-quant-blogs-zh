    "http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/1427/risk-factors-in-analysing-strategies"). 
    Please comment negative or positive.  Unfortunately, I do not spend much time
    talking about all the failed methods that I have discovered but everyone should
    know that my failure rate for mathematically intense strategies is far higher
    than the failure rate for the simple.  Now, I would much rather find more data
    than learn more math and stats.

    I make the less likely they will be correct.

    tested with multi-country and sector datasets extending well beyond 1980 and hopefully
    well beyond 1950 provide me the confidence I need to risk my own money and maintain
    confidence in myself in mass chaos like 2008-2009.  Waiting for mass chaos to
    test your methods and ask questions most likely guarantees a very unfavorable
    result.

    quant funds 2007-2008, LTCM 1998, Victor Niederhoffer, and on and on).  In all
    my experience I have found it is very easy to lose money equally well with both
    sophisticated and basic.  However, making money reliably seems to favor the simple. 
    As long as skeptical questions like this are asked and money flows to shorter
    and shorter High Frequency products, I feel comfortable that I can pursue my infantile
    methods for profit in the markets.  However, I am also an open and humble voracious
    reader who readily accepts any methods that pass my very stringent tests.
