    I am increasingly concerned with a number of signs from some key technical indicators.
    Near the top of my list of concerns is [market breadth](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/breadth),
    as measured by the [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)
    and other similar market breadth indicators. The bottom line is that if the indices
    continue to advance on the strength of a narrow base of rising stocks while the
    majority of issues move sideways or decline, then the rally will have trouble
    sustaining itself.

    have been underperforming the S&P 500 index, notably banks ([KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE));
    homebuilders ([XHB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XHB)); retailers
    ([XRT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XRT)); and semiconductors ([SMH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMH)).
    This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    shows the performance of the four sectors relative to the S&P 500 index over the
    course of the last six months. In all four instances, these critical sectors are
    below the 50 day average of their ratio to the SPX and in the case of the banks,
    the relative performance gap is increasing almost on a daily basis.

    will have difficulty making new highs if all four of these sectors continue to
    underperform on a relative basis. For this reason, I will keep an eye generally
    on market breadth and specifically on these four key sectors.
