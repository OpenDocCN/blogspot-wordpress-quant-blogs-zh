    rebound in the markets has been the ascendancy of large cap stocks over smaller
    capitalization ones.  While there have been many periods in which large caps have
    outperformed small caps, in our current 4 ½ year bull market, this has *never*
    coincided with a dramatic up leg in the S&P 500, as the ratio chart for the Russell
    2000 and the S&P 100 demonstrates below (click for a larger image):'

    an important precedent for large cap outperformance leading the broader markets
    up.  Specifically, the period of 1995-1999 saw the [OEX](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_100/2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.html)
    dramatically outperform the [RUT](http://www.russell.com/indexes/characteristics_fact_sheets/US/Russell_2000_Index.asp)
    in relative terms, dragging the broader markets through a bull run that none of
    us will ever forget.

- en: The 1995-1999 period is also a very interesting one from a VIX perspective (yes,
    it’s always about the VIX, isn’t it?) because it coincides with the one long-term
    bull market in which volatility and stocks moved up hand in hand, as I discussed
    at some length two weeks ago in “[The SPX and the VIX Revisited](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/spx-and-vix-revisited.html).”  (Incidentally,
    given the strong response to that post, I have moved it to the select “Archive
    Highlights” section in the right hand column of the blog.)

    has raised for me is the relationship between volatility and the relative performance
    of different capitalization groups.  Stay tuned…
