- en: We need to find out the market cap of a company that we are receiving quotes
    on from Reuters using RFA 6.x. We see a field called "MKT_CAP" coming through
    on the initial quotes. Looking at the Reuters documentation, this should contain
    the market capitalization of the company.

- en: Reuters support has confirmed that the MKT_CAP field will ALWAYS be 0 for every
    quote.

- en: So, Reuters ... why are you sending this field with every quote if you are never
    populating it? And, how many other fields that come with each quote are not being
    populated with valid values? Don't you realize that low-latency means that you
    should be sending the minimum of data for a quote .... and we expect each and
    every field to contain something useful?
