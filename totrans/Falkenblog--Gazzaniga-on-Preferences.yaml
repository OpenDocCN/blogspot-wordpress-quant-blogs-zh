    our narrating left hemisphere confabulates reasons for beliefs it often doesn''t
    understand, and doesn''t know its confabulating: we lie to ourselves all the time
    because often we don''t know it (the most unethical person I have ever known once
    told me that he never lied, which I knew sounded like trouble, and it was; he
    was a psychopath). It''s the kind of biologically-based psychology that makes
    one happy to live now because as smart as Aristotle or Schopenhauer were they
    just couldn''t have known this, and so at least in some things I can see more
    than they could, and I''m grateful for that.'

    East Asian culture is more oriented towards harmony, Western towards individual
    agency.  When shown a sequence of boxes with lines in them,  fMRI sudies show
    that East Asians looked more at relationships between geometric figures, relative
    judgments, while Westerners looked more at the absolute sizes from one picture
    to the next.  They also found that East Asians looked more at the scene of a picture,
    while Americans looked more at the main items.  This suggests East Asians have
    an even stronger relative utility preference than Americans, and this could have
    asset pricing implications in Asia vs. the West.

    American athlete, or pity when seeing a pathetic looking person, all lit up the
    medial prefrontal cortex.  These are all related to how we empathize, sympathize,

    emotion not related to sociability. This is why he thinks when people find enemy
    groups disgusting it's the first step to dehumanizing them, which can lead to
    all sorts of unempathetic behavior common in human history (outgroups were often
    treated as animals, historically).  More interestingly, greed isn't something
    that pertains to a specific part of the brain, but envy is.  Envy is a
