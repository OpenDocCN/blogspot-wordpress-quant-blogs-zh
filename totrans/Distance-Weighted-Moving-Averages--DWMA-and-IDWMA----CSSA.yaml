    "Combining Acceleration and Volatility into a Non-Linear Filter (NLV)") that provides
    the basis for further research and exploration. In its traditional form, a distance
    weighted moving average (DWMA) is designed to be a robust version of a moving
    average to reduce the impact of outliers. Here is the calculation from the Encyclopedia
    of Math:'

    other data points and is therefore assigned less weight in the final average.
    The advantage of this approach to simple winsorization (omitting outliers that
    are identified from the calculation) is that all of the data is used and no arbitrary
    threshold needs to be specified. This is especially valuable for multi-dimensional
    data. By squaring the distance values in the calculation of the DWMA instead of
    simply taking the absolute value, it is possible to make the average even more
    insensitive to outliers. Notice that this concept can be also reversed to emphasize
    outliers or simply larger data points. This can be done by removing the need to
    invert the distance as a fraction and simply using the distance weights. This
    can be called an “inverse distance moving average” or IDWMA, and is useful in
    situations where you want to ignore small moves in time series which can be considered
    “[white noise](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/filtering-white-noise/
    "Filtering White Noise")” and instead make the average more responsive to breakouts.
    Furthermore, this method may prove more valuable for use in volatility calculations
    where sensitivity to risk is important. The chart below shows how these different
    moving averages respond to a fictitious time series with outliers:'

- en: 'Notice that the DWMA is the least sensitive to the price moves and large jumps,
    while the IDWMA is the most sensitive. Comparatively the SMA response is in between
    both the DWMA and IDWMA. The key is that neither moving average is superior to
    one another per se, but rather each is valuable for different applications and
    can perform better or worse on different time series. With that statement, lets
    look at some practical examples. My preference is typically to use returns rather
    than prices, so in this case we will look at applying the different moving average
    variations: the DWMA,IDWMA and SMA to two different time series- the S&P500 and
    Gold. Traders and investors readily acknowledge that the S&P500 is fairly noisy-
    especially in the short-term. In contrast, Gold tends to be unpredictable using
    long-term measurements, but large moves tend to be predictable in the short-term.
    Here is the performance using a 10-day moving average with the different variations
    from 1995 to present. The rules are long if the average is above zero and cash
    if it is below (no interest on cash is assumed in this case):'

  zh: 注意 DWMA 对价格波动和大幅跳跃的敏感性最低，而 IDWMA 最敏感。比较而言，SMA 的响应介于 DWMA 和 IDWMA 之间。关键在于，移动平均线并非固有上优于另一种，而是每一种都适用于不同的应用，并且在不同的时间序列上可能表现更好或更糟。有了这个说法，让我们来看一些实际例子。我通常更喜欢使用收益而不是价格，所以在这种情况下，我们将以两种不同的时间序列——标准普尔500和黄金——来应用不同的移动平均变体：DWMA、IDWMA
    和 SMA。交易者和投资者都很容易认识到标准普尔500在短期内非常嘈杂。相反，用长期测量方式来预测黄金往往是不可预测的，但大幅度波动在短期内往往是可预测的。这是是使用不同变体的10天移动平均线从1995年至今的表现。规则是，如果平均值高于零则持有，如果低于零则持有现金（在本例中假设现金无利息）：

- en: Consistent with anecdotal observation, the DWMA performs the best on the S&P500
    by filtering out large noisy or mean-reverting price movements. The IDWMA in contrast
    performs the worst because it distorts the average by emphasizing these moves.
    But the pattern is completely different with Gold. In this case the IDWMA benefits
    from highlighting these large (and apparently useful trend signals), while the
    DWMA performs the worst. In both cases the SMA has middling performance. One of
    the disadvantages of a distance weighted moving average is that the calculation
    ignores the position in time of each data point. An outlier is less relevant if
    it occurs for example over 60 days ago versus one that occurs today. This aspect
    can be addressed through clever manipulation of the calculation. However the main
    takeaway is that it is possible to use different weighting schemes for a moving
    average for different time series and achieve potentially superior results. Perhaps
    an adaptive approach would yield good results. Furthermore, careful thought should
    go into the appropriate moving average calculation for different types of applications.
    For example, you may wish to use the DWMA instead of the median to calculate correlations-
    which can be badly distorted by outliers. Perhaps using a DWMA for performance
    or trade statistics makes sense as well. As mentioned earlier, using an IDWMA
    is helpful for volatility-based calculations in many cases. Consider this a very
    simple tool to add to your quant toolbox.

  zh: 与传统观察一致，DWMA 在过滤掉大嘈杂或回归平均的价格波动时，对标准普尔500的表现最佳。相反，IDWMA 的表现最差，因为它通过强调这些波动来扭曲平均值。但在黄金这种情况下，IDWMA受益于强调这些大（看似有用的趋势信号），而DWMA的表现最差。在两种情况下，SMA的表现居中。距离加权移动平均线的一个缺点是，计算忽略了每个数据点的时间位置。如果有一个离群值，那么它发生在60天前就不那么重要了，而发生在今天则重要得多。通过巧妙地操纵计算，可以解决这个问题。然而，主要的启示是可以为不同的时间序列使用不同的加权方案来进行移动平均，并且产生潜在的更好结果。也许一个自适应的方法会产生好的结果。此外，对不同类型的应用，应该对适当的移动平均计算进行深思熟虑。例如，您可能希望使用DWMA而不是中值来计算相关性——这可能被离群值严重扭曲。也许在绩效或交易统计中使用DWMA也是有意义的。正如前面提到的那样，在许多情况下，使用IDWMA在基于波动率的计算中是有帮助的。把这看作是一种非常简单的工具，加到你的量化工具箱里。
