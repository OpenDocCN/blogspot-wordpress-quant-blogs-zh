    quite been able to put my finger on the reason - until I looked at the market
    relative charts to see where the leadership has been coming from.

    If Mr. Market truly believed that the recovery was real, then we should see leadership
    from sectors such as Consumer Discretionary stocks. The chart below shows the
    relative performance of the Consumer Discretionaries (XLY) against the market.
    The sector has been fairly flat against the market since early July, indicating
    that market leadership isn't coming from expectations of a revived consumer.

    the Lehman Crisis and was in need of rescue. Did the Financials lead us up in
    this rally? A glance at the chart below says "no". In fact, Financials remain
    weak and in a relative downtrend versus the overall market.

    consumer or a recovery in the financial sector. Instead, we have a rally led by
    hard assets and capital goods. Digging deeper, this rally tracks the rally in
    the Shanghai Composite, which bottomed in early July and is showing some signs
    of life.

    which has been the last hope of growth in a growth starved world, isn't going

    weaken and so does the much watched ECRI WLI. While a soft landing in China may
    be a relief to investors, a scenario like that is highly unbalanced and does not
    provide the basis for sustainable global growth.
