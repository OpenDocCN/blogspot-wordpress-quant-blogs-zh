- en: There have been quite a few bubbles and mini-bubbles that have burst over the
    past year or so. A short list would probably include [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China);
    housing; oil; fertilizer; [solar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/solar%20stocks);
    dry bulk carriers; etc.

    the whole business of overshooting. Fear and volatility have become so much a
    part of the everyday existence for those who work in the investment world that
    it is all too easy to take them for granted.

    that allows people to bet on the end of western civilization, then I’ll know things
    have gone too far. I haven’t seen such a contract yet, but I feel obliged to note
    that there is a contract for [The U.S. Economy to go into a Depression in 2009](http://www.intrade.com/jsp/intrade/common/c_cd.jsp?conDetailID=647817&z=1225236922807),
    with a depression defined as “a cumulative decline in [GDP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDP)
    of more than 10.0% over four consecutive quarters.”

    oil bubble. You see macroeconomic events moving inexorably in the same direction
    day after day and you begin to assume the future is a predestined march down what
    looks like an unavoidable path.

    I talked about signs I was seeing that fear was already “starting to leave the
    markets.” The VIX has already fallen more than 15% from Monday’s close and there
    is a good chance it will be at least another decade before it sees the 80s again.

    in the System for a Generation?](http://www.informationarbitrage.com/2008/10/is-volatility-embedded-in-the-system-for-a-generation.html)
    In it, Roger paints a picture of a financial crisis receding only to the point
    that it exposes gaping fundamental holes in the economy, the substantial risk
    of a Japan-style deflation, and a Fed so determined to prevent deflation that
    their easy money policy leads to runaway inflation and ultimately some sort of
    cruel game of low growth inflation-deflation ping pong.

    describes a VIX of 40 as the new 20 and predicts a much higher floor for volatility
    in the future.

    VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/big-question-for-vix.html) back on
    May 22^(nd) when the VIX closed at 18.05\. The big question back then, with a
    financial crisis raging, oil approaching 150, and investor anxiety on the increase,
    was why the VIX was below 20.

    or the VIX at 90? It’s hard to say, but suffice it to say that it would have been
    hard to find the appropriate strikes to even make such a bet back then.'

    oil prices that were driving estimates of future economic activity and volatility,
    now the economy is the cause and oil, volatility and the like are the effects.

    all the economic woes on the horizon. It just might, however, signal an end to
    the runaway bull market in fear.
