    is suddenly cheap, and productive capacity is relatively abundant. This adds up

    Previously, I have observed that based on the past five cycles in the CEI, the
    next recession should start during March 2019\. That’s not based on science, but
    rather on a simple average of the length of the previous expansions once the CEI
    had rebounded back to its previous cyclical peak. So it’s a benchmark of what
    could happen based on what happened in the past on average.

    Given the Fed’s latest decision to do nothing, it’s safe to bet that the next
    recession won’t be caused by the tightening of monetary policy anytime soon. It
    could be caused by a severe downturn abroad, I suppose. More likely is that the
    US will continue to grow fast enough to keep the global economy growing as well,

    It does mean that SPX downside projections of 1570 or lower are overblown. It
    does not mean, however, that the market will not decline and test the August lows
