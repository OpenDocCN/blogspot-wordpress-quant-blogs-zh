    is the percentage of NYSE listed stocks that are on a point and figure buy signal.
    As the chart below shows, this indicator had a higher low in March – a bullish
    divergence. I would look for a similar positive divergence on the next re-test
    of the lows as an indication of a lower risk entry point.
