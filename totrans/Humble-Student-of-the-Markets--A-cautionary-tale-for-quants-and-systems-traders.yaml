    a "superstar" doctor, the one whose new patient waiting list stretched out for
    1-2 years, was right 60-70% of the time?

    is often acceptable if it has a 55% success rate. If you get a 65% success rate,
    you are a superstar. Some systems have success rates of less than 50%, but the
    average value of their wins dwarf the average value of their losses.

    techniques to find alpha, but they do it in an environment where the signal-to-noise
    ratio is very low. Let`s not kid ourselves, we know what day traders, swing traders
    and system traders really do.

    traders who think that they may have found their path to riches.
