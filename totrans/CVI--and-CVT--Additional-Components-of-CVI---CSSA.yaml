    the CVI+ to create the “CVI” which is the composite indicator.The purpose of using
    the various indicators described is to further clarify the different contingent
    setups that can exist in security prices that are not differentiated when using
    indicators such as RSI2 or DV2\. Understanding the conceptual and empirical relationship
    between these setups and countertrend/trend indicators is vital to improving performance.  CVI-
    is used to identify downside breakouts , which is the same concpet as the CVI+:
    requiring low volatility but a downside breakout from the consolidation range.
    CVT is essentially a short term trend indicator which indicates the “goodness
    of fit” of recent prices.  The purpose of the CVT is to determine how pronounced
    a move is on the upside or the downside. I have held off on the results on the
    CVI because it is important to understand what goes into the indicator. I found
    that the CVI is capable of telling you when short-term, intermediate-term, and
    long-term moving averages are likely to function as trend indicators or as countertrend
    indicators. In addition, it works even better on daily follow-through MR, short-term
    oscillators or mean-reversion indicators. The performance difference is truly
    remarkable.'

- en: All of the indicators- CVI+, CVI-, and CVT are very useful for traders in their
    own right. They provide information that doesn’t get captured by any one indicator,
    and in the case of CVT – it provides information not contained in standard indicators.
    The value of creating composite breakout indicators is that they are normalized
    and simplified which makes parameter testing and sensitivity much less of an issue.
    I have had commentary sent to me by traders asking why I bothered separating the
    two as I could have easily combined them into one breakout indicator. The simple
    answer is that using each in isolation produces superior results, and also they
    provide incremental information. For example, what is the reverse of a CVI+? It
    is clearly NOT the CVI-, in fact the reverse of CVI+ represents a volatile 10-day
    range followed by a breakown which makes it a separate contingency worth exploring.
    Using them in tandem or separately can form the basis of excellent systems.
