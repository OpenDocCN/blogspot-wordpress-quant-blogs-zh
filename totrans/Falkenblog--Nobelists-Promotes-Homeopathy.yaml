    dilute it several times, it becomes a tonic! Say, add some cyanide to a liter
    of water, mix, then take out a centiliter of the mixture, and add to a liter of
    pure water; take out a centiliter of the mixture, etc. You can do this 20 times
    and basically no salt is left. Homeopathy believes that water has a 'memory' of
    compounds that were once dissolved in it, which through another mysterious mechanism
    explains how homeopathy works. Skeptics of homeopathy, like me, think homeopathic
    medicines have nothing in them because they are diluted too much. Poison and medicine
    is a function of dose, after all.

    everything, even within their field, and they often have insanely stupid ideas.
    That Heidegger was a Nazi, or PCR inventor Kary Mullis believes in astrology,
    John Nash was a paranoid schizophrenic, Newton believed in Biblical numerology,
    are not a paradoxes: the most imaginative people are the most credulous because
    they are prone to dismiss common sense. For creative thought, common sense is
    a bad master. Its sole criterion for judgment is that the new ideas shall look
    like the old ones. In other words it can only act by suppressing originality.
    Original minds find great unconventional ideas, but also lots of bad ones.'

    that if one believes in God that should be relevant to their jobs even if they
    keep such beliefs private, or if it such beliefs had no obvious relation to their
    job (say, an eye surgeon who is otherwise competent believing in fairies). He
    basically thinks one can't be really good at a job if you believe in things he
    finds stupid. I obviously disagree--not just with what he thinks are stupid ideas,
    but also that such stupidity disqualifies one for applying idea in other areas.
    I find comfort in the many perverse beliefs in creative minds, perhaps because
    I disagree with the consensus on many things and it's self-serving.

    is totally open. One of the arguments I really don't like is that if someone believes
    something I disagree with he must be an idiot, or that if he's a genius in number
    theory his opinion on global warming is obviously rigorous and true. People have
    multiple selves, as some people who are warm to their family are monsters to their
    colleagues or vice versa. Most importantly, a person with only 'reasonable' ideas
    would probably be a good manager, but they wouldn't be really creative, or interesting.
