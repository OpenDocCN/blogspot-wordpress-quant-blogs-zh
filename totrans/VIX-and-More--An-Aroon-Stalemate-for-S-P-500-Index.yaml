    been upward, the S&P 500 index (SPX) has struggled to remain above 1400 ever since
    making a post-2008 high of 1422 on April 2^(nd).

- en: There are many ways to determine the strength of a trend and one that has a
    very strong following is the Average Directional Indicator ([ADX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ADX)),
    which was developed by Welles Wilder and first published in 1978 classic, [New
    Concepts in Technical Trading Systems](http://www.amazon.com/New-Concepts-Technical-Trading-Systems/dp/0894590278http:/store.stockcharts.com/products/new-concepts-in-technical-trading-systems).

    trend evaluation tool, the [Aroon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Aroon)
    indicator, which was developed by Tushar Chande. The Aroon is actually two measures
    in one, an Aroon Up (green line in study below main chart) and an Aroon Down (red
    line). Essentially, the Aroon Up and Down lines measure the proximity of N-period
    highs and lows to the most recent trading period, on a 0-100 scale, with 100 indicating
    that the high or low for the period was made during the most recent trading day
    and 0 indicating that the high or low was made on the first day of the N-period
    window.

- en: The default time frame for the Aroon indicator is usually represented as 25
    periods, but in some charting software, the default is 14 periods. Since I tend
    to look at the investing world in months that average 21 trading days, the chart
    below uses my favored default Aroon setting of 21 days.

- en: The chart shows the SPX over the course of the past year, with a strong uptrend
    (green line above 50 or 70) since the second week in December that has recently
    begun to show signs of fatigue on the part of the bulls as it has now been 20
    days since that high of 1422\. On the other hand, the red line shows that it has
    now been 15 days since the SPX made its 21-period low of 1357\. In other words,
    the last three weeks have seen neither the high or the low of the 21-day lookback
    period, as the SPX has meandered in a 65-point range. The result is that both
    the green line and red line have dipped below 30, signaling the absence of any
    meaningful bullish or bearish momentum.

- en: The Aroon indicator is effective as a trend-following tool partly because it
    usually waits for 1/3 to 1/2 of the lookback window to elapse before signaling
    a change in trend – which is generally represented by either the green or red
    line crossing the horizontal lines at 50 or 70.

- en: As it looks now, if stocks were to continue to tread water for the next four
    days, Monday would likely signal an ascendant green line, but Friday’s employment
    report, the European Central Bank and other factors make it unlikely that stocks
    continue to trade in a narrow range for another week or so.
