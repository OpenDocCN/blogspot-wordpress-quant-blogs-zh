- en: But the glaring holes in CAT's story are that the U.S. can suffer a recession,
    the Fed acts and has no effect, the global economy grows as robustly as ever,
    AND CAT rolls into 2010 having achieved 15-20% annual earnings growth and $50
    billion in revenue! Huh? Something tells me that after it is all said and done
    that CAT really thinks that the U.S. will do better in 2008; otherwise, I think
    they are being for too optimistic about the chain of events that keep their long-term
    guidance on track.
