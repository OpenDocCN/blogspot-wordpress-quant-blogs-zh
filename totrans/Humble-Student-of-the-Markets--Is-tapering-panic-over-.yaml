    Fed won't be pushing you to take as much risk. Consider what this means for stocks.
    If the economy does truly take off and earnings grow, then stock prices can rise.
    However, don't expect stock prices to rise because P/Es are going to go up because
    the Fed is pushing the market to take more risk. In fact, P/Es are more likely
    to fall and it will be up the the E component of that ratio, namely earnings,
    to do the heavy lifting.

    to get unwound. Consider DBV, which is an ETF as a measure of the currency carry
    trade. DBV tanked since May 22 and it has struggled with a key technical resistance
    level. Does this look like that risk is getting bought again?
