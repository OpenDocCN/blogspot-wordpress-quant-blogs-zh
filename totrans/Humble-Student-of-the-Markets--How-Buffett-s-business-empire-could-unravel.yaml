- en: One of the hallmarks of Berkshire’s success has been its willingness to raise
    or lower its formidable cash hoard in response to the presence (or lack thereof)
    of viable investing opportunities. One of the other hallmarks of Buffett’s approach
    has been to tune out forecasts and de-emphasize the importance of them in general.

    innovation and economic dynamism will always lead to substantially greater prosperity
    in the future. And he’s been right for decades, through all sorts of setbacks,
    crises and challenges for the nation.

    the Peter Schiff camp, well, I regard that as no real choice at all.

    be prepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves.
    Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly
    rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors
    carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.*'

    of America, and buy good businesses when they become cheap. In a post-election
    interview with CNN, Buffett expressed confidence in the supremacy of the American
    businesses (click on this link if the video is unavailable).

    US real equity returns has been the highest in the world. Though the stock market
    has experienced serious losses, prices have always come back.

    Buffett then couples the value discipline by buying companies with a moat, or
    a sustainable competitive advantage. The combination of buying value companies
    with a moat has been the secret of success.

    In the Age of Trump, the tailwinds on Buffett`s value approach may be coming to
    an end.
