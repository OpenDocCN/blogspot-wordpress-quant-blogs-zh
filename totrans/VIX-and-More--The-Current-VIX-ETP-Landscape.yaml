- en: I have been writing about [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    since the launch of the initial duo of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ) back in January 2009
    and from 2010 onward I have been plotting all of them on a leverage/maturity grid
    like the one below. It is amazing how often various VIX ETP investors mentioned
    one of these charts when I talk to them. Even through the VIX ETP space has been
    relatively stable as of late, I have not updated this graphic since early 2014,
    so a refresh is long overdue.

    VIX-based ETP using leverage on the Y-axis and maturity on the X-axis. With the
    advent of what I am calling VIX strategy ETPs, I have isolated in their own box
    in the lower right hand corner a half dozen of these products whose characteristics
    do not necessarily imply a fixed point on Cartesian coordinate system.

- en: 'The key at the bottom highlights various salient features of each of these
    products. From previous incarnations, I have retained the presence of non-VIX
    legs (typically positions in SPX/SPY), the combination of both long and short
    legs, dynamic allocation of the legs and optionability. I have also shaded areas
    where there is high leverage/compounding risk as well as high roll yield risk.
    Not surprisingly, these risks converge at [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    and [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY), two of the more
    infamous VIX ETPs.  Another carryover is font color, where black indicates ETFs
    and blue is for ETNs.  This time around I have also added yellow stars for those
    ETPs with an average daily volume of 1,000,000 or higher and pink stars for ETPs
    with an average daily volume between 100,000 and 1,000,000\. Note that while [CVOL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CVOL)
    technically makes the cut, at today’s closing price of 0.40, any sort of meaningful
    reverse split to raise the price about 5 or 10 would highlight just how illiquid
    this issue is. In fact, only six VIX ETPs pass the one million share screen: TVIX,
    UVXY, [VIXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXY), VXX, [SVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SVXY)
    and [XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV).'

- en: There are three new additions to this graphic. The most notable of these are
    [VXUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXUP) and [VXDN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXDN),
    which were launched by AccuShares back in May. These products deserve a post (or
    series of posts) dedicated to some of the issues surrounding them, but the short
    version is that high complexity, frequent distributions and consistent tracking
    errors resulted in a product that investors decided was not worth their trouble.
    The other “new” products is, [VQTS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQTS),
    the first ETP that tracks the [SPX VEQTOR Switch Index](https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-500-veqtor-switch-index.pdf?force_download=true),
    making it a relative of [VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)
    and [PHDG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PHDG), but one which uses
    a dynamic allocation to [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    to achieve a 10% target realized (historical) volatility. VQTS was launched in
    December 2014 and like most VIX ETPs, has struggled to reach critical mass.

    new and exciting developments in terms of low volatility ETPs and more broadly
    in the ETP space in general. As I am currently at the [IMN 20th Annual Global
    Indexing & ETF Conference](http://www.imn.org/investment-management/conference/Global-Indexing-and-ETFs/Agenda.html)
    – and scheduled to speak on a panel, “Trading the VIX: Riding Today''s Waves of
    Volatility” with [Larry McDonald](http://www.lawrencegmcdonald.com/lawrence-g-mcdonald/),
    [Mark Shore](http://www.shorecapmgmt.com/mark-shore-background.html) and [Matt
    Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/) tomorrow – this seems
    like a good time to devote more time to writing and in particular to resurrecting
    the “and More” portion of this blog.'
