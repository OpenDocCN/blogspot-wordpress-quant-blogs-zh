    to do with principle, as these are merely pretexts to get lucre. Think of ambulance
    chasing attorneys jumping on Toyota based on dubious claims that accelerators
    were ''stuck'': supposedly they just want a safe public. Yeah sure.'

    usage by me of certain base ingredients for portfolio selection was a violation,
    because it was necassarily informed by their sage stewardship at Telluride. Yet,
    I had used these criteria before Telluride as a portfolio manager, and they weren''t
    exactly secret ingredients: profits, momentum, volatility, mean-variance optimization.
    After the judge noted I did not invent these while at Telluride, she then asked
    the simple question: "what''s your end game? What do you want?" I would have loved
    an end game. Telluride''s lawyers merely said ''to protect our property!'' Later,
    a new judge came in, and asked the same question, and again an unassailable answer:
    ''to enforce a confidentiality agreement!'' Well, the judge couldn''t say he was
    against that, these are bedrock principles!'

    scope of the confidentiality agreement?' It's hard to clear yourself when you've
    been accused of something to be defined later. Principles are great things in
    courts, or rhetoric in general, because its so easy to find one that supports
    whatever you want to do, and so impossible to argue against.

    should not service issuers that seem certain to default, California should just
    declare bankruptcy today.

    Legislators are puppets of basically three unions, that make money based on laws
    passed by those same legislators: the SEIU (janitors, hospital workers), the Teacher''s
    union, and the public safety workers (cops, firemen). California already has high
    taxes and people are out-migrating for the first time in a century, so they face
    the downward portion of the Laffer Curve (ie, higher tax rates → lower revenue).
    It seems pretty clear they need to cut costs, but why wouldn''t the unions push
    for bankruptcy as opposed to benefit cuts? The city of Vallejo recently went bankrupt,
    and it''s still to be determined whether the pensions and union contract have
    priority in their bankruptcy the way they did for General Motors and Chrysler.
    Bondholders should not anticipate priority.'

- en: I bet all of the major investment banks are facilitating debt issuance by the
    State of California and its various agencies, counties, and municipalities. I
    bet also there is a small but spirited set of shorts, trying to make money off
    of the inevitable bankruptcy. With hindsight it will be obvious, and everyone
    currently buying California-related debt will develop amnesia and claim they never
    liked California debt, and were hoodwinked by greedy bankers.
