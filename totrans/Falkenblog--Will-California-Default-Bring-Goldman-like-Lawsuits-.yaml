    usage by me of certain base ingredients for portfolio selection was a violation,
    because it was necassarily informed by their sage stewardship at Telluride. Yet,
    I had used these criteria before Telluride as a portfolio manager, and they weren''t
    exactly secret ingredients: profits, momentum, volatility, mean-variance optimization.
    After the judge noted I did not invent these while at Telluride, she then asked
    the simple question: "what''s your end game? What do you want?" I would have loved
    an end game. Telluride''s lawyers merely said ''to protect our property!'' Later,
    a new judge came in, and asked the same question, and again an unassailable answer:
    ''to enforce a confidentiality agreement!'' Well, the judge couldn''t say he was
    against that, these are bedrock principles!'

  zh: ，他们声称我违反了保密协议。他们声称我使用某些基础投资组合选择因素是违反协议的，因为这必然是由他们在Telluride的智慧指导形成的。然而，我作为投资组合经理在Telluride之前就使用过这些标准，并且它们并不是什么秘密因素：利润、动量、波动性、均值方差优化。法官指出我并非是在Telluride期间发明这些因素后，她接着问了一个简单的问题：“你的最终目标是什么？你想要什么？”我很乐意有个最终目标。Telluride的律师们简单地说“保护我们的财产！”之后，一个新的法官出来了，并问了同样的问题，同样得到一个无法反驳的答案：“执行保密协议！”嗯，法官不能说他反对这个，这是基本原则！
- en: The key key issue was 'what is your property?' or 'what is your view of the
    scope of the confidentiality agreement?' It's hard to clear yourself when you've
    been accused of something to be defined later. Principles are great things in
    courts, or rhetoric in general, because its so easy to find one that supports
    whatever you want to do, and so impossible to argue against.

  zh: 关键问题是“你的财产是什么？”或“你对保密协议的范围有什么看法？”当你被指控某事，而事实将在后续被定义时，为自己洗清罪名是很困难的。在法庭上，或者概括地说，原则是一件很好的事情，因为很容易找到一种支持你想要做的事情的原则，而很难去争辩反对这种想法。

    Legislators are puppets of basically three unions, that make money based on laws
    passed by those same legislators: the SEIU (janitors, hospital workers), the Teacher''s
    union, and the public safety workers (cops, firemen). California already has high
    taxes and people are out-migrating for the first time in a century, so they face
    the downward portion of the Laffer Curve (ie, higher tax rates → lower revenue).
    It seems pretty clear they need to cut costs, but why wouldn''t the unions push
    for bankruptcy as opposed to benefit cuts? The city of Vallejo recently went bankrupt,
    and it''s still to be determined whether the pensions and union contract have
    priority in their bankruptcy the way they did for General Motors and Chrysler.
    Bondholders should not anticipate priority.'

  zh: ，他们的收入中有三分之一是赤字，这是一种无法持续的现金燃烧速度。立法者基本上是三个工会的傀儡，这三个工会根据立法者通过的法律赚钱：SEIU（清洁工，医院工人），教师工会和公共安全工作者（警察，消防员）。加利福尼亚已经征收高额税收，而且人们已经有了一个世纪以来的第一次迁徙，因此他们面临拉弗曲线的下降部分（即，更高的税率→更低的收入）。很明显他们需要削减成本，但为什么工会不会推动破产而不是福利削减？瓦莱霍市最近破产了，现在还有待确定他们的破产是否像通用汽车和克莱斯勒一样享有养老金和工会合同的优先权。债券持有人不应该预期会有优先权。
- en: I bet all of the major investment banks are facilitating debt issuance by the
    State of California and its various agencies, counties, and municipalities. I
    bet also there is a small but spirited set of shorts, trying to make money off
    of the inevitable bankruptcy. With hindsight it will be obvious, and everyone
    currently buying California-related debt will develop amnesia and claim they never
    liked California debt, and were hoodwinked by greedy bankers.
