    In only one of those (1997) did the VIX not hit 40 again shortly thereafter. For
    the other four, we saw 5, 7, 13, and 21 subsequent days in which the VIX made
    it into the 40s again. Given the magnitude of the current difficulties, I would
    be surprised if we do not see at least one more spike into the 40s.**'

    We have had several instances in the past where the VIX spent two full months
    almost exclusively at 30 or above.”**'

    Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    crisis, the VIX closed over 30 each day for more than two consecutive months.
    This feat was matched again four years later in August 2002, following the [WorldCom
    bankruptcy](http://money.cnn.com/2002/07/19/news/worldcom_bankruptcy/) and the
    ultimate bottoming of the dot com crash.'

    consecutive days. A two month stretch of 30+ VIX closes would take us out to mid-November.

    some creativity and potential, then I would not be surprised to see volatility
