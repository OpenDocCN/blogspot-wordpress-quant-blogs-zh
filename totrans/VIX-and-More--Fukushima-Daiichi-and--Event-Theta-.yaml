    nor am I a fan of the gratuitous use of quotation marks for added emphasis in
    print. That being said, I have this tendency to invent new concepts and attach
    labels to them that I pull out of the sky. When I do so, as is the case with [event
    theta](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20theta), the quotation
    marks are merely shorthand for warning readers that I am making stuff up and cloaking
    it in somewhat fancy-sounding attire. In other words, if you Google “event theta”
    you will find a lot of information about sorority functions and the like, but
    nothing (as far as I can tell) about options concepts.

    label for it?

- en: Nineteen days ago, Japan was hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a subsequent
    tsunami that measured at least 30 feet high in some places. As everyone now knows,
    the earthquake and particularly the tsunami damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
    power plant and set off a [chain of events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_I_nuclear_accidents)
    that resulted in a partial core meltdown, damage to at least one containment vessel,
    overheating of spent fuel rods and dangerous levels of radiation leaks. The situation
    has been a fluid one, with a limited flow of information, particularly during
    the early stages of the disaster.

    myself whether time was in favor of or working against the efforts of those who
    were trying to limit the damage to the nuclear facility and surrounding areas.
    In other words, was this a positive theta event (time in our favor) or a negative
    theta event (a fight against the clock.) Not being an expert in the field of nuclear
    energy and knowing that certain factors could spiral out of control quickly, but
    also knowing that efforts were underway to stabilize some of the processes in
    the plant, I was left to guessing whether current efforts were more likely to
    fall short and result in a vicious cycle or were expected to stem the problem
    and turn the tide in favor of the rescue team.

    implications for investment strategies. From a hedging perspective, event theta
    could influence the selection of hedging vehicles, the anticipated timing for
    those hedges, how the hedges might be structured and what sort of prices might
    be appropriate. For the speculative investor, event theta can also help to determine
    the risk-reward payoff structure and how it varies over time. Anyone who trades
    in VIX futures and deals with the VIX term structure on a daily basis should have
    some insights into potential mismatches between event theta and term structure.

    in this space [earlier](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html)
    regarding [event volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility).
    I maintain that it applies to [Libya](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Libya),
    the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    and almost every other threat to the financial markets. Going forward, I will
    give event volatility and event theta some additional treatment in this space
    as conditions warrant.
