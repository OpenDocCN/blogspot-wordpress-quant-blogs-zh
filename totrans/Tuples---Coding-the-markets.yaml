- en: Matt [mentioned the addition of tuples](http://mdavey.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/where-did-clr-30-go/)
    to CLR 4.0\. Very happy to see that. Tuples help avoid the unnecessary introduction
    of types that serve merely to aggregate data. Types or classes to aggregate data
    was a very mid 90s programming technique, manifest in code featuring classes with
    data members, getter and setter accessor methods, and no significant behaviour.

    The [recent post](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/trading-strategy-the-vix-spread-and-the-stock-market/)
    on the effect of drastic market moves on automated trading strategies was intriguing.
    Finally, thanks to [Marc](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com) for the heads up on
    [this one](http://rodrickbrown.com/blog/). I’ll be keeping an eye on it.'
