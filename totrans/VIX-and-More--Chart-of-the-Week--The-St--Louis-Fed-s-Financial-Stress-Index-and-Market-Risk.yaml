    formal name) is just a shade above its lifetime average, yet the yield on the
    10-Year U.S. Treasury Note is just a week away from its all-time low. Granted
    the Fed has been distorting interest rates with [Operation Twist](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Operation%20Twist)
    and other policy initiatives, but it has only been in the last month or so that
    yields have dipped below 1.7%.

    institutions is the St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index (which I refer to as
    the [STLFSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STLFSI)), which has [18
    component measures](http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/net/NETJan2010Appendix.pdf)
    that include a variety of interest rate and yield spread data, as well as the
    VIX, measures of bond volatility and other data that are correlated with market
    stress.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below shows the movements in the STLFSI and the VIX since the beginning of 2007\.
    Note that for most of 2012 the VIX has been indicating much less risk and uncertainty
    than the STLFSI. Only since the middle of May have I observed the VIX rise to
    a relative level that is consistent with the STLFSI. As of last week, for instance
    the STLFSI was at the 79^(th) percentile of its lifetime range, while the VIX
    was in its 82^(nd) percentile. For the record, the divergence was widest in the
    middle of March, when the STLFSI had a 68^(th) percentile reading, yet the VIX
    was mired in the 23^(rd) percentile. Financial historians might also be interested
    to know that the mid-March divergence was the largest since August 2008…
