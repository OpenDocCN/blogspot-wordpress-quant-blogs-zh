    States is experiencing reflects a severe shortfall of aggregate demand. Despite
    three quarters of growth, real GDP is approximately 6 percent below its trend
    path. Unemployment is high fundamentally because the economy is producing dramatically
    below its capacity. That is, far from being "the new normal," it is “the old cyclical."'

    very high -- and very disturbing -- levels of overall and long-term unemployment
    are not a separate, structural problem, but largely a cyclical one. It reflects
    the fact that we are still feeling the effects of the collapse of demand caused
    by the crisis. Indeed, at one point I had tentatively titled my talk "It’s Aggregate
    Demand, Stupid"; but my chief of staff suggested that I find something a tad more
    dignified.

- en: The sensible way to address the deficit is with a long-run plan. It would be
    penny-wise but pound-foolish to try to deal with our long-run problem by tightening
    fiscal policy immediately or foregoing additional emergency spending to reduce
    unemployment. Immediate fiscal contraction would inevitably nip the nascent economic
    recovery in the bud -- just as fiscal and monetary contraction in 1936 and 1937
    led to a second severe recession before the recovery from the Great Depression
    was complete. And nothing would be more damaging to our fiscal future than a protracted
    recession and permanently higher unemployment. But, a credible, comprehensive
    plan for deficit reduction would create a favorable climate for investment and
    ensure that the economy remains strong.
