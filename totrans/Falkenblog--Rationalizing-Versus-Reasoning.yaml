    very prolix. But this is in contrast to formal academics, whose 50-page academic
    treatises don't seem as long because they follow a protocol. Both approaches have
    their plusses and minuses. The long-winded autodidact posts (eg, Razib over at

    that Reason can be used to argue for anything. And so there is no point in arguing
    that God doesn't exist, because you could just as well argue that God does exist.
    Nothing left but to believe whatever you want.

    despair seem Deeply Wise. If they catch you trying to use Reason, they will smile
    and pat you on the head and say, "Oh, someday you'll discover that you can argue
    for anything."...

    you into an answer whether you liked it or not, and fake thinking was that which
    could argue for anything.

    be helped by trying to play Devil's Advocate. Students who have genuinely never
    thought of trying to search for arguments on both sides of an issue, may be helped
    by the notion of "Devil's Advocate".

    debate; single actions have multiple consequences. If you can't think of strong
    arguments against your most precious favored policies, or strong arguments for
    policies that you hate but which other people endorse, then indeed, you very likely
    have a problem that could be described as "failing to see the other points of
    view".

- en: I know someone who lamented the moral emptiness of the lawyers he was facing,
    and a friend told him not to blame the lawyers, they were just doing their job,
    and a just one too, because every side needs an advocate. He thought this was
    silly. Surely every position has its arguments, but some positions are still,
    net net, indefensible. To be able to argue anything effectively is to merely be
    a tool for others. A powerful tool, but still a tool.

  zh: 我知道有人对他面对的律师的道德空虚感到懊悔，一个朋友告诉他不要责怪律师，他们只是在做他们的工作，而且是正当的，因为每一方都需要辩护人。他觉得这很荒谬。当然，每个立场都有其论点，但有些立场仍然是，最终，无法辩护的。能有效地辩护任何立场只是成为他人的工具。一个有力的工具，但仍然是工具。
