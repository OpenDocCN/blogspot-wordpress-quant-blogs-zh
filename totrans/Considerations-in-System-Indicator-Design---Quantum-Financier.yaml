    is partly why we use indicators. They summarize information in a concise way that
    is easier to interpret that the raw market data. A lot of them are actually transforms
    borrowed from other fields adapted to financial markets. Engineering is an obvious
    one, considering the ever-growing number of engineers hired by hedge funds and
    trading firms. They are also quite appealing to the system designer also as they
    give a systematic way to code trading rules. I also found that designing indicator
    is one of the best exercises to further understanding of a certain market phenomena.
    Trying to find a way to process the financial data to expose a certain type of
    information in a novel way forces us to stop and think about the underlying mechanics
    of the market which can only be beneficial for a serious investor. It is this
    process we will look at in the remainder of the post.

    applied to the data to put into evidence selected aspects of it. Take the relative
    strength index (RSI) for example. It does nothing more than isolates and normalize
    the magnitude and the velocity of the recent price movements. Also note that there
    is many ways to extract the same type of information, think DVO.

    is to consider the statistical attributes of the process we want to model, in
    this case the market. Here are a few commonly accepted ones to get you started
    (by no mean an exhaustive list):'

    to 1 when the market goes south.

    to be considered when developing indicators or system (see [Michael Stokes’ TAA
    series](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/10/20/roundup-tactical-asset-allocation/)
    for a good example). Doing this kind of analysis of the underlying process we
    want to model/evaluate, we get valuable insight and we are better prepared to
    tackle the creative thinking process by knowing more about what we are after.
    It also offers a framework to work with when thinking of the market in general,
    which in turn can only spark more ideas and keep the creative juices flowing!
