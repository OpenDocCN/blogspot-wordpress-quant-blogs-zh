    was some buzz that it would lessen the probability that the Federal Reserve would
    undertake QE3\. I don't think so.

- en: The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy,
    and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.
    ***The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by
    the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is
    most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.***
    Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term
    inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and
    moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote
    maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.

    that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may
    change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, ***it would
    not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment***; rather, the Committee's
    policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment,
    recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.
    The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.
    Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates
    of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's
    Summary of Economic Projections.

- en: The Fed also announced an explicit 2% inflation target for the first time in
    its history. This explicit inflation target also helps reduce uncertainty about
    policy long-term. The Fed will use the 2% annual target, based on changes in personal
    consumption expenditures (PCE) as their measure. The current year-over-year increase
    in PCE is 1.8% in the latest numbers. So they're still a touch below those targets.
    Bernanke was asked in the press conference following the meetings, "why PCE and
    not the consumer price index?" ***One reason is that in CPI, housing has a far
    greater weight. It appears to have understated inflation during the housing bubble
    and may overstate it now that renting is more popular than buying. The PCE is
    also adjusted more flexibly to changing consumption patterns.*** Fed critics might
    also argue that annual increases in PCE also tend to be lower than changes in
    the CPI.

    the more volatile components of the inflation rate.

- en: Any way you look at it, core PCE and trimmed mean PCE remains stubbornly low
    and below the 2% target. This suggests to me that the Fed believes it has more
    room to stimulate without igniting an inflationary spiral. Watch this series for
    hints that QE3 might be moving off the table and don't fret about signs of a cyclical
    rebound from economic releases like NFP.
