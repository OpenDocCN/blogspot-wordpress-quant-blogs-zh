    It points to data such as the ISM Manufacturing PMI, which rose from 43.1 in May
    to 52.6 in June, indicating expansion. The employment index improved from 32.1
    to 42.1, and the new orders index increased from 31.8 to 56.4..

    rebound. PMIs are designed to measure month-to-month changes. The economy is still
