    There is no question that countries cannot run these kinds of enormous deficits
    without getting into trouble. Deficit hawks point to the Britain under Margaret
    Thatcher and the benefits of that painful restructuring.

    then and now. Thatcher’s Britain was the only country in the region to take the
    deficit reduction path at the time. It worked because of my favorite economist
    phrase "everything else being equal". What happens everything else wasn't equal
    and if everyone tries austerity at the same time?

    Of these countries, only Germany and Japan have current account surpluses. The
    rest are capital importers. These countries will duly run fiscal deficits that
    are bigger than their private surpluses. We have, as the hysterics note, a tide
    of fiscal red ink. Which came first – private retrenchment or fiscal deficits?
    The answer is: the former. In the case of the US, the huge shift in the private
    balance between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, from
    a deficit of 2.2 per cent of GDP to a surplus of 6.6 per cent, coincided with
    the financial crisis. The fact that aggregate demand and long-term interest rates
    tumbled at the same time shows that the collapse in private spending “crowded
    in” the fiscal deficits. Wild private behaviour drove the wild public behaviour.'

    European economy and so force beggar-my-neighbour outcomes on the hapless US.
    As Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington
    noted in the FT last week, such policies could be very dangerous. ***Thus, far
    from being stabilising, premature fiscal retrenchment threatens destabilisation
    of the world economy. In this case, a decision to turn the eurozone into a huge
    Germany would – and should – be seen as an act of mercantilist warfare upon the
    US. How long would the latter put up with the hypocrisy of surplus countries that
    blame borrowers for the deficits their own surpluses make inevitable?*** Not much
    longer, would be my guess, at least now that the US government has become the
    world’s borrower of last resort.to be a balance.
