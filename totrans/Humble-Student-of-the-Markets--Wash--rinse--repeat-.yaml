- en: Not just yet. When I reviewed some of my secondary indicators on the weekend,
    they hadn't quite confirmed the bullish breakout staged by the SPX. Consider,
    for example, the relative returns of SPY vs. TLT (US long Treasury ETF) as an
    indicator of the risk-on vs. risk-off trade. As of Friday's close, this relative
    return ratio remains in a trading range and has not confirmed the bullish equity
    breakout.

  zh: 还没有。当我在周末审查了一些次要指标时，它们尚未完全确认了SPX的牛市突破。例如，考虑SPY与TLT（美国长期国债ETF）的相对回报，作为风险偏好与风险偏好之间交易的指标。截至上周五收盘，这个相对回报比仍处于交易区间，尚未确认股票的牛市突破。
- en: The same non-confirmation can be found in the relative performance of defensive
    sectors, such as Consumer Staples against the market. As of Friday's close, Consumer
    Staples remain above a relative support level and has not broken down, which would
    indicate that the bulls had taken control of the stock market. Similarly, the
    relative performance of Utilities (not shown) also shows a similar pattern of
    holding up above relative support.
