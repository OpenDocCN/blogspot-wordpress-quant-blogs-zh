    of the moves are getting more compressed. When I wrote last Monday that the markets
    looked a little overbought and that it was maybe time for a little pullback (see

    was imminent. Nor did I expect that we would move from a short-term oversold condition
    Wednesday on one of my trading models to a near-overbought reading by the close
    Friday.

    a key level of technical resistance on decent volume. Does this mean that the
    bull and bear tug of war is over and the bulls have won?

- en: Not just yet. When I reviewed some of my secondary indicators on the weekend,
    they hadn't quite confirmed the bullish breakout staged by the SPX. Consider,
    for example, the relative returns of SPY vs. TLT (US long Treasury ETF) as an
    indicator of the risk-on vs. risk-off trade. As of Friday's close, this relative
    return ratio remains in a trading range and has not confirmed the bullish equity
    breakout.

- en: The same non-confirmation can be found in the relative performance of defensive
    sectors, such as Consumer Staples against the market. As of Friday's close, Consumer
    Staples remain above a relative support level and has not broken down, which would
    indicate that the bulls had taken control of the stock market. Similarly, the
    relative performance of Utilities (not shown) also shows a similar pattern of
    holding up above relative support.

    rally, the chart of the Euro STOXX 50 is still struggling to rise above resistance.
    In addition, while the yields on Spanish and Italian bonds have fallen, they have
    not fallen sufficiently for me to wave the all-clear signal.

    victory yet. To be sure, there are good reasons to be relatively sanguine about
    the outlook. China seems to be turning around, as evidenced by the better than
    expected HSBC flash PMI last week; Mario Draghi has taken the risk of Eurogeddon
    off the table, as least for now; and the American economy appears to be stabilizing,
    or at least it's not going over a cliff.

    through and take control, my base case remains that of a market dancing the step-forward
    and step-back shuffle, though I may be tactically inclined to either increase
    or reduce my portfolio beta. Wash, rinse and repeat.
