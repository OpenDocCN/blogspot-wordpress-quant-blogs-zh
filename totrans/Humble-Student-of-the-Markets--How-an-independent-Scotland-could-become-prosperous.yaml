    we expect it to extract a high fiscal and regulatory price (probably insisting
    on a primary budget surplus). The re-domiciling of the financial sector and UK
    public service jobs, as well as a legal dispute over North Sea oil, would further
    accelerate any downturn. In our opinion, as North Sea oil production slows, we
    estimate that the non-oil economy would need a 10% to 20% devaluation to restore
    competitiveness. This would wages, driven by a steep rise in unemployment.'

    uncertainty. Among the biggest doubts are those hanging over the currency. Financial
    businesses that must be regulated and supported by the UK will flee. Scottish
    deposit insurance would be as worthless as the Reykjavik-run scheme that failed
    to cover Icelandic banks in 2008\. Cautious Scots must already recognise that
    the pounds in their bank accounts may end up as something else. Far safer to move
    the money south.

    within Scotland. This will surely force them to shrink the supply of credit to
    the Scottish economy. The UK government could try to prevent money from leaving
    Scotland, but this would require draconian controls, which it will not impose.
    Either Westminster or the Scottish government could offer to indemnify lenders
    against currency risks. The UK government will not do that. It will let the credit
    squeeze happen, blaming it on the Scottish decision. It will be Scotland’s choice,
    if it can meet the cost.

    when this process is over, the English will resent the people who repudiated them
    and the Scots will resent the people who did not give them independence on the
    terms to which they believed they were entitled. A United Kingdom will give way

    taxes than the residual UK; that would drive economic activity away. It will pay
    a higher interest rate on public debt because its government will be unfamiliar
    and dependent on unstable oil revenues (almost certainly smaller than Mr Salmond
    imagines). Fiscal fibs will be exposed.

    Billions of pounds have been wasted to date on weapons that must never be used
