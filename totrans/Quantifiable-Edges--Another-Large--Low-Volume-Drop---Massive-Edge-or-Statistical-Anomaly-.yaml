    since the initial bounce off the July lows topped out. In the last six days the
    S&P 500 has closed either up at least 1.25% or down at least 1.25% five times.

    is certainly eye-popping. An average return of over 5% in the next 7 sessions.
    That’s a substantial pop to say the least. For those who would like to review
    the dates, they are all listed below. Notice how 2002 dominated the study.

    So to the header question: Are we looking at a massive edge or a statistical anomaly?'
