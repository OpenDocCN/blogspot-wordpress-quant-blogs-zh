    intermediate-term (10-30 days or so). Today the S&P 500 dropped 2.4% and the Nasdaq
    2.6%.

- en: The Explosive Moves off Bottoms study last night identified 10 instances where
    new lows were followed by 3.5% up days. The 5/27/70 instance continued higher
    without a short-term pullback. The 7/5/02 instance dropped lower and didn’t bounce
    for a long time. The other 8 instances all experienced a pullback within a few
    days before heading higher. The average pullback of those 8 instances was 2.6%.
    So the size of the pullback today isn’t alarming. I just wasn’t expecting it to
    happen all in one day.

- en: It’s difficult to extrapolate much from just two instances, but I found it interesting
    none the less that the only other times this has occurred was near major market
    bottoms. One caveat is that today’s decline came on higher volume while in 1987
    and 2002 it came on lower volume. Hopefully today will keep enough people on the
    bearish side that the rally can take hold. Investors Intelligence saw a slight
    drop in bulls to 30.9% and a slight rise in bears to 44.7% making that index even
    more extreme. Put/call ratios remain high and the VIX headed back up close to
    30\. My intermediate-term bullish bias has not changed.
