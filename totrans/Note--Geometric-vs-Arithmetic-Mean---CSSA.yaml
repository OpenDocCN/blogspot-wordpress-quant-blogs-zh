    cumulative return versus the arithmetic mean of short term returns. The derivation
    of the geometric mean would be to take the power of of the geometric cumulative

    is never larger than the arithmetic mean which is true, however I was referring
    to the geometric cumulative return series which does in fact fluctuate between
    being higher or lower than the arithmetic mean of returns. My own terminology
    was the source  of confusion, nonetheless the results are accurate . Here is a
