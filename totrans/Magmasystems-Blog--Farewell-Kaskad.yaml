- en: A player in the CEP space, Kaskad, is no more. Colin Clark writes in to say
    that, since the Boston Stock Exchange (BSX) has ceased to function, Colin had
    to disband Kaskad. I assume that since Kaskad did the work for the BSX as consultants,
    the BSX maintained all or most of the IP rights. Or, perhaps, Kaskad felt that
    since their only client was no longer funding their development, they could not
    gain further VC money in this financial environment.

- en: According to the Aite report on CEP vendors, Kaskad had 16 employees. Since
    they are based up in Boston, I wonder if Streambase is looking at adding some
    additional talent.

    have anything that might interest him. Colin was involved in the old NEON (New
    Era for Networks) back in the dotcom boom, so he has the entrepreneural streak
    running through him.
