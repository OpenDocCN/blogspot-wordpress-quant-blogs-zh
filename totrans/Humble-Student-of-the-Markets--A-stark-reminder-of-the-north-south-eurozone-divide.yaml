    compared to 10.1% a year ago, there are vast gaps in unemployment rates between
    member states. Most notable are Germany at 5.5% (vs. 6.8% a year ago), the Netherlands
    at 4.8% (vs. 4.4%) and Austria at 4.1% (vs. 4.2%). The underperforming PIIGS are
    suffering vastly higher unemployment, with Greece at 18.3% (vs. 13.9%), Ireland
    at 14.3% (vs. 14.2%), Portugal 12.9% (vs. 12.3%), Spain at an astounding 22.8%
    (vs. 20.5%) and Italy an outperformer at 8.5% (vs. 8.4%). As a point of reference,
    the unemployment in France, which is the other major partner in the eurozone leadership,
    stands at 9.8% (vs. 9.7%).

    of these cutbacks start to wind their way through these economies, will unemployment
    go up or down?
