    have reprised the [VIX and More Fear Poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll)

    voters, covering 40 countries over the past two days.  The question:  “Which of
    the following makes you most fearful anxious or uncertain about the stock market?”

    trading, flash crashes, exchange stability, etc.)” as the #1 concern, but a late
    flurry of votes today for “[China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)
    – weak economic growth” put China concerns over the top. Combining Chinese growth
    concerns with concerns about a bubble in Chinese stocks and/or housing makes it
    a landslide in favor of all things China. Without too much of a stretch, one could
    also lump in the likes of [currency](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies)
    problems, deflation, low [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil)
    prices and falling [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities)
    prices in general into a broader China-related bucket and suddenly the China +
    ripple effect accounts for about 50% of the votes.'

    those non-U.S. respondents. This time around, the area most overemphasized by
    Americans relative to the rest of the world is, in classic Americentric myopia
    fashion…”U.S. – weak economic growth,” which 8.7% more Americans label as their
    #1 concern than their non-U.S. counterparts. Conversely, the biggest blind spot
    for Americans – at least relative to the concerns of the rest of the world – is
    commodities prices, which Americans underweight by 5.1%. A close second in the
    American myopia sweepstakes is Chinese bubbles in stocks and/or housing. I do
    not find the commodities oversight to be surprising, but certainly the relatively
    low concern about Chinese bubbles is unexpected.'

    dataeback to 2012 and chronicle a U.S. public that was so obsessed with the [fiscal
    cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff) that they did
    not fully appreciate the gravity of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis).
