    on the X-axis.  I also included a half dozen VIX strategy ETPs that have no easily
    discernable point on the leverage-maturity grid.  Depending on how finely you
    wish to split hairs, these twenty-four ETPs cover approximately seventeen unique
    ways to trade volatility long and short, across various maturities and according
    to a wide variety of strategic approaches.

    fact, the mean VIX ETP lost over 21% for the year.  This means that in those instances

    performance of these products for 2015.  Given the chaos created by regular, special
    and corrective distributions, in addition to reverse splits and stock dividends,
    calculating performance for these two ETPs is not a project I have the inclination
    to tackle right now.  That being said, until I see the calculations, I cannot
    be 100% sure that VXUP had a losing year in 2015.  Consequently, in the event
    that VXUP did post a gain, this would be a good time for AccuShares to post some
    performance data and claim at least one public relations victory in this space.

    volatility-based ETP that would have been a winner in 2015, this is an interesting
    time to consider moving forward with that idea.
