    multi-national margins are much higher than companies focused on the domestic
    economy. This effect is likely due to the tax avoidance schemes of multi-nationals
    whereby they shelter much of their income in offshore subsidiaries.

    macro analysis (they are elevated and therefore should mean revert) vs. a bottom-up
    micro analysis (it`s a regime change because interest rates are low and companies
    have learned to lower their effective tax rates). A better way of phrasing the
    real top-down economic puzzle was raised by Ben Inker of GMO, namely that

    but since then investment has been somewhere between a little bit anemic and,
    today, downright depressing.*** That doesn''t do anything for expectations of
    future growth, because productivity growth really does require investment and
    we''re not getting much investment. So, it''s hard to see how we''re going to
    get productivity growth, but profits for companies are really less about productivity
    growth and more about the return on capital. And if you are not getting a lot
    of investment, then you don''t get one of the avenues towards pushing profit margins
    back down. Normally, higher investment would happen and that would lead to higher
    competition and the erosion of profit margins. So, if we''re looking for reversion
    in profit margins, which we are, it''s sort of the longer-term more subtle issues
    about what does it mean to have high profits in the corporate sector that is not
    accompanied by high investment.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The analysis from Dan Suzuki of BoAML indicating that net margins are elevated
    screams "low cost of capital" to me. In past instances where we have see low costs
    of capital (Japan in the 1980's and China today), we have seen an investment bubble
    form. When companies enjoy low cost of capital, the proper response is to raise
    as much money as you can and buy something, anything, to raise your returns. So
    if the cost of capital is so low, why haven't we seen a surge in corporate investments
    in the developed markets?
