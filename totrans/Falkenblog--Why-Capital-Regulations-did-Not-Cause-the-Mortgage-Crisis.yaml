    capital regulations. Mortgages were historically the lowest loss rates of any
    asset class, for the entire dataset anyone looked at. Think of a capital regulation
    as a rule enforced by government. If the rule is binding, this merely makes the
    activity more expensive, as when you amortize the cost of getting caught smoking
    pot (including potential career repercussions, which vary considerably by profession).
    Many rules we think are unnecessary are worked around, as for instance,

    if done directly (it violates Reg-T for retail brokerage accounts). There are
    shares that allow you to be short, which for 401ks is otherwise illegal, but now
    legal.

    shouldn't. Moderation in all things is a good rule, and what prevents most people
    from excess is discipline. People generally don't do things to excess because
    it causes various hangovers, real and metaphorical. So, if the government assigned
    a low capital ratio to mortgages, this did not cause banks to invest in mortgages
    in excess unless they also believed these were of low risk. It was a common mistake.
    So common, in fact, I think it strains credulity to think the regulation was extremely
    important. There were enough investors and companies not bound by US banking regulations
    involved to note this was bigger than them.
