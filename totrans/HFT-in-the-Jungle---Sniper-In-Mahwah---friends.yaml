    to relax. The first episode of *The Walking Dead*, season 6, did not disappoint
    (for those who do not know *The Walking Dead*, this is the story of human survivors
    who try to stay alive in a world full of *walkers* who look like zombies). In
    this episode the human “refugees” found out about a camp of zombies locked in an

    between two points (here, around my backyard, the two points are three: Frankfurt,

    (the public website of the French radio regulator), but most of the data are irrelevant
    now (and not available on Cartoradio anymore), as the high-frequency traders have
    better paths, as we will see. I’m pretty sure the McKay bros would have accepted
    to share a space, but they are not in Calais anymore. The only HFT microwave provider who
    may be in Calais is perhaps New Line Networks (that’s what I understand by comparing
    Cartoradio data and Ofcom [data](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/licences?googloc=(50.95743491028871%2c+1.873244047164917)&code=301010&se=(50.95705978275052%2c+1.8736651539802551)&googoffset=0.0&nw=(50.957810034798605%2c+1.8728229403495789)&unit=GHz&ne=(50.957810034798605%2c+1.8736651539802551)&service=Fixed+Links&sw=(50.95705978275052%2c+1.8728229403495789)&submit=Submit+search&groupKey=2)),

    jungle in Grande-Scynthe? Because it was located near a gas station where trucks
    stop. But it’s not over. Since some migrants from the Grande-Scynthe jungle fail to
    break into the trucks, they are trying to reach other areas, not in France anymore
    but in Belgium (obviously, the Belgian Prime Minister [wrote](http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-belgium-france-idUKKCN0V51DJ)
    to the French Prime Minister and complained that France was not able to manage
    “their” refugees – poor Europe). Various newspaper articles testified that some
    refugees take the Belgian tram going from the France-Belgium border to Ostende,
    meaning that they are passing by the Oostduinkerke building where HFT firm Vigilant
    Global and microwave provider New Line Networks want to install dishes. But other
    migrants seem to walk through the country side to reach Veurne (also known as
    Furnes in Dutch), where there is an [industrial park](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-31871532)
    with a lot of trucks going to England:'

    is a small village named Houtem (part of the Veurne city), and Houtem is now famous
    because of the 243-meter tower Jump Trading purchased in 2013 for $5,000,000 to
    cross the Channel (the tower is very close to the France-Belgium border):'

    France-Begium border, this is the perfect and discrete way to do it. You just
    have to walk in the silent fields, there is no fence there, no police – only this
    giant tower the Belgian State sold to Jump in 2013:'

- en: That’s how the migrants meet the high-frequency trading world – again. It’s quite probable some
    refugees crossed the border around the tower, and it’s obvious they never imagined
    that the eyes of the towers, the dishes pointing to England, allow a high-frequency
    trading firm to cross the Channel *in 25 microseconds*. The big difference, here,
    is that by going North the migrants move away from the shortest path between the continent
    and the kingdom (the Calais-Dover route), whereas Jump is in Belgium because the
    firm could achieve the best possible path. The refugees and the HFT dishes are
    lurking in the same area – same purpose, but different temporalities; two extreme
    worlds in my backyard. We live in fascinating times.
