    is helpful, but what is missing is more detail on understanding the output from
    the algorithms. ¬†As an example, take the sample code for¬†prostate.csv. ¬†Once the¬†Generalized
    linear model is applied to the dataset, more information on the output, and also
    the summary() output would aid beginners. ¬†I suspect this is some book or other
    reading material that solve this knowledge gap.
