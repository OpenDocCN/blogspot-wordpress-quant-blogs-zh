# Humble Student of the Markets: Another sign of a short-term bottom

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/05/another-sign-of-short-term-bottom.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/05/another-sign-of-short-term-bottom.html#0001-01-01)

I recently wrote that gold and gold stocks could be setting up for a short-term trading bottom (see

[A bottom for gold and gold stocks?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.ca/2012/05/bottom-for-gold-and-gold-stocks.html)

) and followed up with a post that the market may be seeing a short-term reversal at these levels (see

[The "Merde" rally?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.ca/2012/05/merde-rally.html)

). Now comes another sign that a trade-able bottom in risky assets may be near.

The chart of the gold stock ETF GDX below shows that it experienced

[an outside day](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outside-days.asp#axzz1uQKgdbu7)

yesterday on high volume, which is an indication that we could be seeing signs of a trend reversal.

While there is still a high degree of headline risk, consensus sentiment is becoming overly bearish, which is contrarian bullish (see Mark Hulbert's article

[Major correction unlikely](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/major-correction-unlikely-2012-05-09)

), and the stock market is now overpricing tail-risk in Europe. Notwithstanding the problems posed by Greece, the message from the bond markets of

[France](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GFRN10:IND/chart)

,

[Italy](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GBTPGR10:IND/chart)

and

[Spain](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GSPG10:IND/chart)

is one of relative calm.

Who would you rather believe, the stock market or bond market?
