    know at least one trader is sure to be taking today: a VIX pre-expiration [butterfly](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/butterfly).'

- en: The butterfly trade highlighted below is for illustrative purposes only, but
    should explain the approach. The idea is simple. This butterfly trade will make
    a profit if the special opening quotation ([SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ))
    for the VIX is between 46.80 and 53.20 – about 6.4% in either direction from the
    current VIX level of about 50\. In other words, if the VIX falls in a 12.8% band
    around the current price, the trade makes money.

- en: Of course a lot can happen with the VIX in less than a day, but in terms of
    trading, there are about 3 ½ hours left in today’s session. Before tomorrow’s
    open, there are several important economic reports, including January building
    permits and housing starts, as well as January industrial production and capacity
    utilization. If those reports don’t bring the end of the world any nearer than
    it is now – or indicate that all the economic problems are suddenly solved – then
    the VIX butterfly trade should be in good shape.

    will happen if the VIX SOQ is ‘pinned’ at 50 tomorrow morning.
