    of the call volume and [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    for the VIX, I am going to try to whelm you a little more by switching over to
    weekly charts of [SPY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPY) (the ETF
    for the S&P 500 index) puts.

    long positions) with the additional leverage of [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls)
    may prefer the [increased liquidity](http://biz.yahoo.com/opt/stat1.html), dollar
    strike price increments, and [penny pricing](http://www.888options.com/help/faq/general.jsp?prt=nyse#26)
    benefits of SPY puts.

- en: Looking at the chart below, the SPY put volume correlates nicely with intermediate
    bottoms in the SPX/SPY.  Note the current spike in put volume. It is something
    to think about, anyway, as you contemplate what the Fed could possibly say that
    might put a stop to the slide in the equities market.
