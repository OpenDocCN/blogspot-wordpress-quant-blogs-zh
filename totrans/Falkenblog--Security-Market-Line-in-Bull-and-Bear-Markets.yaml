    I would agree that if you know you are in a bull market--that is, you know the
    stock market will be up at the end of this month--then it is preferable to be
    in high beta stocks. Yet, implementing this timing rule is not straightforward
    because even abstracting from the variance drag of high volatility stocks, the
    dominance of low vs. high beta changes whether you are using contemporaneous or
    ex ante indicators. That is, it makes a big difference if you use data from today
    to determine tomorrow's portfolio, or data from tomorrow night.

    to predict. Low beta stocks move lesss than high beta stocks. In up markets, low
    beta stocks go up less than the average, and much less than the high beta stocks.
    In down markets, low beta stocks go down less than high beta stocks.  Here''s
    my data on beta portfolios since 1962 using monthly data, using the separation
    of whether the contemporaneous S&P return that month was up or down. Bottom line:
    if you know markets are going up, go into high beta stocks.'

    is highly correlated, and so, perhaps, low volatility periods are better for high
    volatility stocks?! Alas, no. Looking forward, it goes the other way. That is,
    using last month's volatily, lower-than-average vol means it's better to be in
    low volatility, and the opposite in high volatility regimes.
