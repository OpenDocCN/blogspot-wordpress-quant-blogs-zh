    of major players, who all seemed to either grow up ''on the wrong side of the
    tracks'' or went to Groton. Am I the only person who had middle class parents,
    average in most ways? Perhaps that''s my exceptionalism--extreme conventionality!'

    your book, because I think it was uniformly rated well in praise surrounding extended
    quotes (see Tabarrok

    but you might receive a nice note from the publisher, or some nice links from
    the popular author if you have nice things to say. Book reviews are like stock
    analyst recommendations pre Sarbanes-Oxley.

    that happened over the course of the last 20 years is the core idea that you could
    model away risk. One of the things that was striking in [Greenspan''s] apology
    was when he said: Several people have won Nobel Prizes for the work that has turned
    out to be flawed.'

    much in models. This is not insightful, because it leads to infinite regress.
    If you believe models are imprecise, and so add some uncertainty around them,
    this too is a model. Sure, you can keep compounding your uncertainty, but eventually
    this leads to avoid lending altogether, which is clearly suboptimal. But then
    Nocera mentions this pertaining to MBIA:'

    said: Actually, our models were pretty accurate. If we plugged in a 20% decline
    in housing prices, they showed the world blowing up. But we just assumed that
    that could never possibly happen! Famous paper by the Orszag brothers and Joseph
    Stiglitz, who was a Nobel Laureate, showing how remote it is that Fannie or Freddie
    would ever go bankrupt. Absolutely true.'

    rather this singular assumption: that housing prices, nationally, would not fall
    significantly year-over-year. It is much more parsimonious explanation; it explains
    more with less.'
