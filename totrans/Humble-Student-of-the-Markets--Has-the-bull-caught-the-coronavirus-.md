# Humble Student of the Markets: Has the bull caught the coronavirus?

Is the bull on his last legs? It is starting to look that way. I alerted readers to an unconfirmed bullish monthly MACD buy signal in late July (see

[A (deceptive) long term buy signal](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/07/31/a-deceptive-long-term-buy-signal/)

). The buy signal was confirmed in late October by both the Wilshire 5000 and non-US markets (see

[Buy the breakout, recession risk limited](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/11/03/buy-the-breakout-recession-risk-limited/)

). In the past, monthly MACD buy signals have usually been very effective and long lasting. The recent market downdraft has brought the indicator to the verge of a sell signal, indicating dying price momentum and the possible end of the bull phase. If the market were to end the month at these levels, the sell signal would be confirmed.

A similar bearish condition can be found in the MSCI World xUS Index.
