    she wanted her daughter to feel bad. That is, though she loves her daughter, she
    wants her snowflake to feel bad sometimes, as it's a healthy corrective when one
    inevitably does bad things. The question is,

- en: Guilt and shame are emotions not present at birth because they require a sense
    of self and standards; babies don't feel them. She defines shame as feeling bad
    about oneself, guilt feeling bad about behavior. Shame is feeling 'I am bad',
    guilt is feeling 'I did a bad thing.'  Both are painful, but guilt is not nearly
    as overwhelming.

    focused on how others think about us. Shame attempts to hide and deny to escape
    the situation, even anger.  Guilt involves regret and remorse, and leads to a
    focus on reparation and redress. Guilt and other-oriented empathy go hand in hand,
    while shame interferes with empathy.

    are not as mentally healthy as people prone to guilt. Further, people prone to
    shame blamed others more for their misfortune, classic defensive Freudian projection.
    Shame-proneness is more related to depression, anxiety disorders, low self-esteem,
    drug use, destructive behaviors, etc. Guilt proneness, in contrast, is associated
    with lower recidivism by convicts.  It doesn't seem to be inherited, as the correlation between
    parent and child in shame-proneness was a measly 0.1\.

    shame and humiliation, but rather to call children's attention to the harm that
    they've done, make redresses, and empathize with those they have hurt.  Guilt
    is much more constructive and proactive, and changing behavior is the key to improving
    one's situation.
