    at the margin for lower taxes and regulation. Even in the latter case, which I
    think best reflect most market economies, the mandarins at the top and the patronage
    workers at the bottom need the entrepreneurs to generate enough taxes to subsidize
    them. Everyone would agree that some level of taxation less than 100% is optimal
    due to the incentive effects (for example, France’s 2014 75% top rate tax was
    quickly rescinded back to 45% because of weak revenue). The question is merely
    what that number is. Politics would be a boring battle between those who want
    taxes to be 40% and those who want them to be 50%—the libertarians vs. the egalitarians,
    each acknowledging that their difference of opinion is merely a matter of degree.

    focused on life, liberty, and property, a free economy with minimal government
    interference (zero government is a straw man caricature). To the extent that people
    are poor, unconditional charity makes them worse, as poverty is primarily the
    outcome of a lack of purpose and discipline rather than food and shelter. Thus,
    workhouses for the poor had codes of conduct and required hard work. Regardless
    of circumstances, the poor can achieve better lives. The formula is neither complex
    nor mysterious. The key choices are to work steadily and stay on the right side
    of the law. For example, if one follows 3 simple rules—finish high school, get
    a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children—only 2
    percent of such people are in poverty today.

    Second was the death of God, as intellectuals believed organized religion was
    simply a relic of the past, like our belief in the divine right of Kings. No longer
    was it sufficient to merely be right with God, but rather, to do good on earth

    appeal to people who desire primarily to become part of something larger than

    A tribe not only helps us materially but also addresses the universal craving

    they are proud of, that values them. To merely make more money but still be relatively
    poor, is not an attractive objective because it implies they are not valued. There
    are many such groups to join, as people are interested principally in doing well

    state-sanctioned monopolies. For example, when a city sets a cap on the number

    taxicab drivers and their customers. Thus, auto and steel union were very strong
    in the 1950s, and those 1950s members did quite well, but the cost was fewer such
    jobs in the future decades; teachers do not have to worry about losing their jobs
    for poor performance, but then education is the one area of the economy where
    real costs of educating students keeps going up, while the real cost of making
    most things (corn, cars, computers) tends to fall. Some think everyone should
    be able to work in a field that has monopoly benefits like tenure, so people do
    not have to deal with the anxiety and costs that come with losing a job. Yet,
    the collective costs of this would be to eliminate productivity growth, as then
    labor would not reallocate to where it is best needed. The essence of the market’s
    superiority to socialism is that in market economies capital and labor is allocated
    away from where it destroys value and towards where it creates the most value.

    they tried to increase elk by eradicating wolves, but then the elk ate all the
    grasses and trees the beavers used, so the beavers vanished, causing the meadows
    to dry up, and the trout and otter to disappear.

    things worse. The inherent weakness of a democracy that elects a powerful government
    is that the intelligence of half the voters is one standard deviation below that
    of the average college graduate. To the extent these people are unable to manage
    their self-interests, they are even less competent to judge who has the best plan
    to manage the self-interests of others.

    angels modeled by academics, but rather, just as selfish as any businessman; they
    simply want government-sanctioned monopolies that restrict competition under the
    pretext of protecting consumers or ensuring quality. In this environment, a top-bottom
    coalition built on political patronage has an obvious advantage and inevitably
    creates a bureaucracy that measures productivity by inputs instead of output.

    has been a major influence because it presumes that if you add up the various
    components of GDP—consumption, investment, state spending—you can fiddle with
    the money supply or fiscal policy and get on a “turnpike” to optimal growth. That
    has never worked. In contrast, Aristotle taught that the primary task of the state
    was to encourage virtue, as a society of virtuous citizens who interacted freely
    would create a flourishing society, bottom up, without direction. The focus, again,
    should be on individual virtue and responsibility, rather than top-down solutions
    that treat individuals as agentless ciphers.

    regulations, Clinton’s bias the opposite. As a libertarian, that’s key. Unfortunately,
    Trump’s cross-over appeal was that he wasn't a prudish Christian like Mitt Romney
    yet anti-PC enough to imply he'd stop persecuting Christians, which correlated
    with the remarks that probably doomed his candidacy.

- en: Trump dominated Republicans because he combined the libertarian goals of lower
    taxes and regulation that all other Republicans were for with non-libertarian
    immigration and foreign trade restrictions. This appeals to the many low-capital
    wage earners who are worried that cheaper foreigners are usurping their jobs.
    An immigration policy like those of Australia, Canada, Singapore, or New Zealand

    their values despicable and increasingly illegal. The key is not to agree on ends,
    as hard-core libertarians and Christians will always disagree on matters relating
    to swearing, sex, drugs, and God. The focus should be on what politics should

  zh: 我们需要摆脱那些仍然相信关键问题是金本位和合法大麻的古典自由主义者，而转向那些愿意支持基督徒和美国工人而非非技术移民的人。基督徒需要拥抱古典自由主义原则，因为只有这些原则可以保护他们免受一个发现他们的价值观令人厌恶并逐渐非法化的国家的伤害。关键不在于就目标达成一致，因为古典自由主义者和基督徒在关于咒骂、性、毒品和上帝等事项上总是不一致的。重点应该放在政治的目的上：建立一个让具有不同目标的人们可以相处和繁荣的体系。
