    title for this post, but something like “*Strange and Unusual Charts You are Guaranteed
    Not to Find Anywhere Else*” and their ilk seemed like too much work.

    all the momentum and support/resistance charts say that a bear curtain has descended
    upon the markets.  On the other hand, [Panglossian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangloss)
    types are still able to find solace in the fact that some oscillators suggest
    that the recent moves down have been excessive.  Additionally, they can always
    change the moving averages on their charts from days and weeks to months in order
    to support their contention that the markets are in the midst of pulling back
    to support.  At this stage, deciding which camp has the most like-minded souls
    has as much to do with one’s philosophy and outlook as it does the result of rigorous
    analysis.

    from yesterday suggested, perhaps the only things that do matter are what the
    bearded man sings and how mellifluously it falls on our ears (that and perhaps
    whether he is a baritone or a castrato.)  Hint: if it’s [Das Lied von der Erde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Lied_von_der_Erde),
    I’m buying gold.'

    the chart below not so much because the conclusions are fresh (“things are bad”
    or “things are about to turn,” depending upon your perspective), but because I’m
    fairly sure you cannot find this chart anywhere else.  The chart tracks the ratio
    of up volume to down volume for the NYSE and uses a 21 day EMA to smooth the data.  The
    NASDAQ version of the data looks similar, but this NYSE chart shows the potential
    for volume data to help call both tops and bottoms in advance.  So dial up some
    [Mahler](http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/mahler.html) and watch the volume.
