# Humble Student of the Markets: The things you don`t see at market bottoms, bullish bandwagon edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-things-you-dont-see-at-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-things-you-dont-see-at-market.html#0001-01-01)

It is said that while bottoms are events, but tops are processes. Translated, markets bottom out when panic sets in, and therefore they can be more easily identifiable. By contrast, market tops form when a series of conditions come together, but not necessarily all at the same time.

I have stated that while I don't believe that the stock market has made its final cyclical top, we are in the late stages of a bull market (see 

[Risks are rising, but THE TOP is still ahead](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/06/18/risks-are-rising-but-the-top-is-still-ahead/)

 and

[Nearing the terminal phase of this equity bull](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/07/02/nearing-the-terminal-phase-of-this-equity-bull/)

). Nevertheless, psychology is getting a little frothy, which represent the pre-condition for a major top.

As a result, this is another post in an occasional series of lists of "things you don't see at market bottoms". This week, I focus on the theme of further signs of the bullish bandwagon.

To summarize, 

[Callum Thomas](https://twitter.com/topdowncharts/status/882709183380017153)

of Topdown Charts constructed a Euphoriameter, consisting of forward P/E, VIX (inverted), and bullish sentiment. Readings are highly elevated, though they have not reached the highs seen at the last cycle top.
