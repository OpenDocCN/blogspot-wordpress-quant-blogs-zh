- en: As I type at 8am EST the SPY is up about 1.7% pre-market. Going back to 2003
    there have been 9 times the SPY has gapped up at least 1.5% after closing at a
    10-day low. Every time it has risen more between the open and the close. Below
    I’ve listed all the instances.

- en: Should this morning's gap hold until the open we could see a short-covering
    rally ensue. You should note, though that drawdowns have been sizable in several
    instances (last column).
