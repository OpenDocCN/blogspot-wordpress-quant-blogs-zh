    low volatility and a general downward trend.

    whether the rate is as benign as we initially surmised. Although this might seem
    like an acceptable intended consequence of the aggressive monetary easing by the
    US Fed, I fear that we will face the historically normal unintended consequences.

    US bond market [Approaching the Zero Bound - Bonds](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/01/approaching-zero-bound-bonds.html),

    \ lately in the press. We can add US yields to my favorite chart from [Japan -\
    \ JGB Yields\x96More Lattice Charts](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/05/japan-jgb-yieldsmore-lattice-charts.html).\
    \ Most of the difference is in the short end of the curve where the US is still\
    \ near the minimum since 2012 while Japan is near the max out to 7 years."
