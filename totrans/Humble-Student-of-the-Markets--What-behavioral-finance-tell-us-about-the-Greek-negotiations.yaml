    is not what they reveal about the effects of scarcity. It’s their assertion that
    scarcity affects anyone in its grip. Their argument: qualities often considered
    part of someone’s basic character—impulsive behavior, poor performance in school,
    poor financial decisions—may in fact be the products of a pervasive feeling of
    scarcity. And when that feeling is constant, as it is for people mired in poverty,

    United States— more than all the McDonald’s (12,000) and Starbucks (nearly 9,000)
    locations combined. It’s a popular way to get money today, particularly for those
    without bank accounts. But for people without reliable incomes, debts must often
    roll over into the following month, incurring exorbitant fees. “This type of high-risk

    games that have right and wrong answers, there are no right responses in Family
    Feud, just popular ones (the list of answers is gathered from a survey of 100
    people prior to the show). Because contestants must think through an array of
    options before answering, time pressure limits the number of paths they can explore
    before hazarding a guess, so scarcity’s effects are in full bloom.

    At first, the poor performed better than the rich did; scarcity made them focus
    more intently on the task. But when, in the next round, the subjects were allowed
    to roll over their loans and “repay” in subsequent rounds (thus making future
    rounds shorter), things quickly fell apart for the poor contestants. Early borrowing
    created a vicious circle for the poor; pressed for time, they needed to borrow
    more seconds, and borrowing more made them more pressed for time. By the final
    rounds, most of their time went to paying back loans, and the poor lost rounds
    that the rich won handily.
