    United States— more than all the McDonald’s (12,000) and Starbucks (nearly 9,000)
    locations combined. It’s a popular way to get money today, particularly for those
    without bank accounts. But for people without reliable incomes, debts must often
    roll over into the following month, incurring exorbitant fees. “This type of high-risk
    borrowing seems ridiculous,” Mullainathan says, but “we wanted to prove that thinking

    comes from putting out fires.”'

    lender分支机构——比所有麦当劳（12,000家）和星巴克（近9,000家）的门店加起来还多。这是当今获取资金的一种流行方式，特别是对于没有银行账户的人来说。但是对于没有可靠收入的人来说，债务经常要滚动到下个月，产生高昂的费用。“这种高风险借款看起来很荒谬，”Mullainathan说，“但我们想证明，这种思维方式并不是由于缺乏金融理解或愚蠢——而是因为扑灭火灾。”

    to roll over their loans and “repay” in subsequent rounds (thus making future
    rounds shorter), things quickly fell apart for the poor contestants. Early borrowing
    created a vicious circle for the poor; pressed for time, they needed to borrow

- en: Syriza’s supporters were accused of being irrational, were threatened and cajoled
    not to destroy the country in advertising campaigns of breathtaking negativity.
    This confirmed in my mind that conventional politics supported the very system
    that collapsed globally and spectacularly only a few years ago; a system that
    eschews taxation, but required unprecedented bailouts from taxation; a system
    that, somehow, has now gone back to being considered infallible, supreme and self-correcting.

  zh: Syriza的支持者被指责为不理性，在令人惊叹的负面广告活动中受到威胁和诱导，不要摧毁国家。这证实了我的想法，传统政治支持的是一个全球范围内几年前崩溃的、令人瞩目的系统；一个逃避税收，却需要前所未有的税收救助的系统；一个现在不知怎的，又回到了被认为是不可动摇、至高无上、自我纠正的系统。

    different with Syriza, however risky, made better sense. Dignity might be an abstract
    concept, but its absence is a very real and practical thing. Stand outside a central
    Athens supermarket at closing time, to see elderly women, dressed in black, rummaging
    through bins for food and you will see it. Spend a day with my mother, who worked
    two jobs for 45 years, paid every cent of tax and now finds herself diagnosed
    with Alzheimer’s, with no decent health or social provision and a monthly pension
    of €400 (£300), and she will explain it to you.

  zh: 我得出结论，投票支持那是理性的，尝试与Syriza不同的东西，无论如何都是更有意义的。尊严可能是一个抽象的概念，但失去尊严是非常真实和实际的事情。在雅典市中心的超市
    closing time 外面，你会看到穿黑衣的老年妇女翻找垃圾桶找食物，你就会明白。和我母亲一起度过一天，她工作了45年，支付了每一分钱的税，现在发现自己被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默病，没有像样的医疗或社会福利，每月养老金为400欧元（300英镑），她会向你解释的。

    aiming to dismantle it. To ask for radical change without victimising migrants.
    As a migrant myself, this was very important to me. It was possible to be pro-EU
    and still want to punch its current monetarist policies in the face. The EU as
    a project is very worthwhile. We need to fight for the Europe we want. The idea
    that what stands between each of us and a life of prosperity is a hypothetical
    Romanian cleaner is the most ludicrous one we have ever been sold.

  zh: 此外，Syriza给了我一个表达对欧盟不满的方式，而不会试图肢解它。要求根本性的变革，而不损害移民。作为一名移民，这对我是非常重要的。可以支持欧盟，但仍希望其目前的货币主义政策受到打击。欧盟作为一个项目是非常有价值的。我们需要为想要的欧洲而奋斗。什么东西站在我们每个人和假设的罗马尼亚清洁工之间，让我们过上繁荣的生活，这是我们被推销的最荒谬的观念。

- en: The only promise Tsipras made that truly mattered to me was to “give dignity
    back to the people”. Of course, he cannot deliver that. Only people can deliver
    that for themselves. But even mention of that word, “dignity”, in a political
    context, struck an important chord. It was hugely refreshing to have someone speaking
    that sort of language, instead of tired neoliberal dogma of privatisation equalling
    efficiency. To start from priorities and then define the method.

  zh: 对我来说， Tsipras 唯一重要的承诺是“归还人们的尊严”。当然，他做不到。只有人们才能为自己争取尊严。但在政治环境中提及这个词“尊严”，引起了重要的共鸣。在这种环境中，有人说出这样的话，而不是陈旧的自由主义教条，将私有化等同于效率，这是非常清新的。从优先事项出发，然后定义方法。

    of Greeks would vote for SYRIZA and 21.4 percent for ND. Such a result would allow
    SYRIZA, which co-governs with the right-wing Independent Greeks, to rule autonomously.
    Potami garnered 6.1 percent, followed by Golden Dawn on 4.4 percent, the Communist
    Party with 4.3 percent, ANEL with 3.2 percent and PASOK falling below the 3 percent
    threshold to enter Parliament with 2.9 percent. The survey found that 79 percent
