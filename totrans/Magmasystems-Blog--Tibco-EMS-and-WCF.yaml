- en: Our framework has an entire hand-written communications layer that allows us
    to communicate over TCP/IP, EMS, various market data systems, MSMQ, etc. We would
    like nothing more that to gut this layer and replace it with WCF. The missing
    ingredient has always been EMS support. Now, hopefully, this will be rectified,
    and hopefully Tibco will offer it to existing EMS customers at no charge.
