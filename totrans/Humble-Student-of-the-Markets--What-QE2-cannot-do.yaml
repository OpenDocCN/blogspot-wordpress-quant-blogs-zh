    then someone, somewhere, is going to take a big haircut. Most likely, the haircut
    is going to show up somewhere in the financial system.

    on the magnitude of the problem. I do have a foggy memory that back in 2008, it
    was the combination of bad paper and excessive leverage caused a financial panic.

    fighters. During these episodes, the central banker can inject liquidity into
    the financial system. However, if a bank is sunk by bad loans (or bad mortgage
    paper that it's holding), then its assets are less than its liabilities, or deposits,
    and it is deemed to be insolvent. Insolvent banks can't be saved by additional
    liquidity, they need equity injections.

    no amount of Fed Treasury purchase can save the system. Something else would have

    A look at the relative performance chart of the Financials against the market
    shows that, despite the stock market rally, Financials remain in a relative downtrend
    and continue to underperform the market. In fact, the sector is now testing a
    relative support zone, with little downside protection should relative support
    fail.

    bears watching as a barometer of the robustness of continued strength of the market
    rally.
