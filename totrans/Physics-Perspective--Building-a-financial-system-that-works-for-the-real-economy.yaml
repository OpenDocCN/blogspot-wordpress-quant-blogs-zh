- en: of a talk given recently by Sony Kapoor at the Global Systems Dynamics Workshop
    in Berlin. As it happens, I was there and got to see the talk in person; it's
    funny and very insightful. Kapoor used to work at Lehman Bros (well before it's
    collapse), and eventually quit investment banking to do more useful things --
    he now works at Re-define, a think tank on public policy.
