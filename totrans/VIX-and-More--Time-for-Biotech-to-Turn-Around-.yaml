    that I may start talking about in more detail in this space in the coming weeks.

- en: I mention this because the system generated a buy signal in [BBH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bbh),
    the [HOLDRS](http://www.holdrs.com/holdrs/main/index.asp?Action=Definition) biotechnology
    ETF.  While the system does not require a confirmation signal from today’s trading,
    BBH is trading up with the broader markets today, albeit with a smaller percentage
    rise.  The chart below shows that biotech actually bottomed in January and has
    not participated in the rally off of the March lows.  Generally a healthy biotech
    sector is an indication of bullish speculative activity.  As such, this is one
    of my ‘[indicator species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_species)’ charts
    to watch.
