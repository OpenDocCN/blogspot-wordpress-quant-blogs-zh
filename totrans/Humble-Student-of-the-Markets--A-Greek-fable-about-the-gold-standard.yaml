    insolvencies, bank runs, forced seizure of deposits, unemployment and underemployment
    exceeding 40%, blood in the streets, a fall of the government, a complete reneging
    of the terms of the "rescue packages," an abandonment of the hard currency monetary
    regime, a mega-devaluation, and a massive default of foreign debt obligations.

    – it forces them to adjust to excessively high domestic prices, large trade deficits,
    and/or large fiscal deficits in the same way they would have had to adjust under
    the gold standard, and I don’t think that is politically likely to be acceptable.
    The countries that need depreciation to regain competitiveness or monetization
    of the debt to regain control of the deficit will have to choose between adjusting
    via deflation and high unemployment or exiting the euro. Politics makes the latter
    more likely.

    a gold standard virtually impossible. The kinds of solutions envisaged are akin
    to the medieval practice of throwing someone into the water to see if the subject
    is a witch. If she floats, she is a witch and should be burned at the stake. If
    she drowns, oh well…
