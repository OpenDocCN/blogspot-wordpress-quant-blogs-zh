    she is the only one who knows how to play it. Bob says the flute should be handed
    to him as he is so poor he has no toys to play with. Carla says the flute is hers
    because she made it.

    the poorest, will have the support of the economic egalitarian. The libertarian
    would opt for Carla. The utilitarian will argue for Anne because she will get
    the maximum pleasure, as she can actually play the instrument. Sen states there
    are no institutional arrangements that can help us resolve this dispute in a universally
    accepted just manner.

    should look at enhancing the redistribution of life-saving goods and removing
    'injustice'.

    to allocate the flute between the three children, why not ask first under which
    rules would the flute have come into existence? If Carla knew she would not get
    the flute, she would not have made it. Therefore, just add a time dimension to
    the puzzle, and there''s no puzzle at all: only a libertarian form of justice
    is consistent with the flute existing.'

    exist independent of our allocation rules, which we then choose between. It's

    social welfare theorist like Sen to make such an error highlights that experts
    are working within a paradigm, and a flawed assumption (ie, wealth is given) makes
    all the resulting argument lame.
