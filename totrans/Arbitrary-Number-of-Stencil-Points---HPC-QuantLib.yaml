- en: The standard finite difference implementations of derivative pricing algorithms
    based on partial differential equations have a spatial order of convergence of
    two. Reason is that these implementations are using a three point central stencil
    for the first and second order derivatives. The three point stencil leads to a
    tridiagonal matrix. Such linear systems can be solved efficiently with help of
    the Thomas algorithm.

- en: Higher order of spatial accuracy relies on stencils with more points. The corresponding
    linear systems can no longer be solved by the Thomas algorithm but by the BiCGStab
    iterative solver with the classical three point stencil as a very efficient preconditioner.
    The calculation algorithm for the coefficients of larger stencils on arbitrary
    grids is outlined in [1].

    standard error reduction techniques are in place, namely adaptive grid refinement
    around important points [2] and cell averaging around special points of the payoff
    at maturity or – equally effective for vanilla options – put the strike in the
    middle between two grid points. Let’s focus on the Black-Scholes-Merton PDE

    from second order to fourth order when moving from the standard three point to
    the five point stencil. On the other hand solving the resulting linear systems
    takes longer now. All in all only if the target RMSE is below ![10^{-5}](img/7ead4319aa38e361a41a8f81f542388d.png),
    the five point stencil will be faster than the standard three point discretization.
