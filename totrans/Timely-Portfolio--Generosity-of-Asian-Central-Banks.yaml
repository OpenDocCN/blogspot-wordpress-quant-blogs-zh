    PIIGS is the generosity of Asian Central Banks who have been consistently quantitatively
    easing since 1998 ([Join the Reserves](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/07/join-reserves.html)).

    death spiral (see [Death Spiral of a Country](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/03/death-spiral-of-country.html)
    and [Death Spiral Warning Graph](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/03/death-spiral-warning-graph.html))
    in 2008 and still might fall into this disastrous trap.

    action has found support with our fine politicians [Washington Post "Senate approves
    China currency bill"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/senate-approves-china-currency-bill/2011/10/11/gIQAhvaUdL_blog.html). 
    The US needs to recruit some US $ buyers, but unfortunately there are none to
    fill the multi-trillion dollar gap.

    problem.  The focus on China does not make sense when you look at the appreciation
    of the Chinese Yuan.  I see a lot more Korean cars on the road and TVs and appliances
    in the stores, but I do not hear any mention of the extreme undervaluation of
    the Korean Won to the US$ but especially the Japanese Yen, so it appears the Koreans
    Won.

    induce a positive feedback death spiral.
