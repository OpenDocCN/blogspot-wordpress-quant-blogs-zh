    that had extreme [short interest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20interest)
    positions. I posted about this portfolio the next morning in [Short-Covering Driving
    Today’s Gains](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/short-covering-driving-todays-gains.html).

- en: I thought this would be a good time to share the performance of these heavily
    shorted stocks and ETFs during the course of the past 7 ½ weeks. I have the graphics
    below from [Finviz.com](http://finviz.com/) to show how the portfolio has performed.
    As a bond ETF, [TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT) probably
    should not be in the group, but since I included it in the original portfolio,
    I’m leaving it in here for now. For what it’s worth, removing TLT from the portfolio
    pushes the total return up to 116.60%. Clearly, a large part of the recent gains
    have come from short covering the likes of Deutsche Bank ([DB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DB)),
    MGM Mirage ([MGM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MGM)), and shopping
    center REITs Macerich ([MAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MAC))
    and CBL & Associates ([CBL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CBL)).
