    50-day high in the SPX.  This is something I have looked at in the past, and the
    intermediate-term implications suggest possible difficulty.  I’ve shown this study
    a few times on the blog, most recently last October 31st.  The last time it triggered
    was March 13th.  I have updated the results below.

    investment. This may have lead people to forsake stocks in favor of lower risk
    returns with improved yield.  Of course the “high” yield we are now seeing certainly
    does not seem high.  Still, this study has triggered a number of times over the
    last several years and it continues to suggest struggles for the SPX.  So it seems
    worth being aware of.
