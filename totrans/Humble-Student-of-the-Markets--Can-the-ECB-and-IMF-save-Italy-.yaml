    Monetary Fund may deliver as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion) to fight
    the debt crisis, two people familiar with the negotiations said.

    potentially to underwrite precautionary lending programs for Italy or Spain, the
    two countries judged to be the most vulnerable now, the people said.

- en: The IMF normally operates by a tranche-and-reform model. The bailout money is
    provided in chunks, and each chunk is given only after specific defined and monitored
    reforms are implemented. This grants the IMF leverage over the state in question
    to ensure that the agreed-upon reforms are not only crafted, but implemented and
    stuck with for the duration. Otherwise the ward is cut off, as Belarus has recently
    been.

    an immediate funding crunch like most IMF wards. It has a preexisting debt stock
    that’s about 120 percent of GDP — it’s unserviceable, and Italy faces billions
    in maturing debt that must be refinanced on a monthly, and sometimes even a weekly,
    basis — 300 billion in refinancing needs in the first half of 2012 alone.

    not within the existing skill sets of IMF staff, it would deny the Fund the leverage

- en: In the real world of global finance the reality is that any country that is
    forced to accept an IMF bailout is also blocked from issuing debt in the public
    markets. IMF (or other supranational debt) is ALWAYS senior to other indebtedness
    of the country. ***That’s just the way it works. When Italy borrows money from
    the IMF it automatically subordinates the existing creditors. Lenders hate this.***
    They will vote with their feet and take a pass at Italian new debt issuance for
    a long time to come. Once the process starts, it will not end. There will be a
    snow ball of other creditors. That's exactly what happened in the 80's when Mexico
    failed; within a year two dozen other countries were forced to their debt knees.
