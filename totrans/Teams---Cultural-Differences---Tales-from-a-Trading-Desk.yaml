- en: As previously blogged, [Getting More](http://www.gettingmore.com/) by Stuart
    Diamond, provide some valuable [commentary](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iti_XnB2ockC&lpg=PT245&ots=cwI4zl1-L2&dq=getting%20more%20stuart%20diamond%20cultural&pg=PT239#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    on cultural differences, and the implication of getting it wrong.  Anyway dealing
    with multi-region teams, interactions or negotiations should seriously consider
    reading Stuart’s book, and getting to know the culture, rather than making “assumptions”. 
    Video of Stuart Diamond’s Google talk (2011) is available on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOZo6Lx70ok&feature=youtu.be)
    for those interested.
