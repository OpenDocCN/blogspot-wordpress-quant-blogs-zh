    like derivatives, such as credit default swaps and mortgage backed securities.
    But, compare these assets to the assets and liabilities within a company: goodwill,
    deferred tax expense, intangibles, patents. Who can value these from first principles?
    Further, the company has the ability to change its business mix at any time, creating
    new products. We happily trade equities of these companies, and these are residual
    claims on this pyramid of assets and liabilities. Thus, the complexity of a mortgage-backed
    security of any sort is actually quite modest in that context. The complexity
    is not the key problem, in his view.'

    that is in this kind of distress. So, take a bond trader used to managing his
    risk via hedging with Treasuries. The interest rate risk is paramount, and exposure
    to the stock market infinitesimal. After this major credit event, the sensitivities
    of his portfolio with equities is greater than his sensitivity to interest rate
    risk. This change is new to him, and he is confused. Looking at this like a put
    option that goes from out of the money to in the money, highlights how this regime
    change can happen, how a sensitivity to equity and volatility change goes from
    zero to material.

    Swan' by name. I agree that the concept of Black Swans is unhelpful, but I think
    the existing paradigm needs something new to explain this, in terms of the transmission
    mechanism.
