# VIX and More: VWSI at Zero After VIX Hits 5 ½ Year High

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/vwsi-at-zero-after-vix-hits-5-year-high.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/vwsi-at-zero-after-vix-hits-5-year-high.html#0001-01-01)

You know it’s an interesting market when the VIX hits a 5 ½ year high (37.57) on Tuesday, while the VWSI actually manages to end the week down a point at zero.

Part of the reason for these statistical oddities is that the VIX fell 23% from Tuesday’s high to Friday’s close, resulting in a weekly gain of ‘only’ 1.9 (7%.)  The 29.08 close is the second highest end of week close since March 2003, behind only the 29.99 close in the middle of August 2007.

With a 23% move already accounted for, the VWSI has a neutral volatility outlook going into the week, apparently viewing last week’s volatility snap back move as already having fully discounted future mean reversion opportunities.

As is my weekly custom, for a survey of the best in current thinking about the markets, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/) sums up the crazy week that was and the week that lies ahead in his [End of January Linkfest](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/01/end-of-january.html).

As we wait for the Fed to announce their next move(s), this might be a good time to cut back on trading an brush up on some reading.  In case you missed it, I would start with Roger Lowenstein’s [author of When [Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management](http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259)] [The Education of Ben Bernanke](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20Ben-Bernanke-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin) from last Sunday’s New York Times.  Three books I have recently enjoyed that are particularly pertinent to current markets are:

Also, for links to Fed speeches, charts of market action on Fed Days, etc., don’t forget my collection of [Fed Links](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-links.html).

*(Note that in the above temperature gauge, the "bullish" and "bearish" labels apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated with the VIX.)*

***Wine pairing:***  For a VWSI of zero, I began 2007 by recommending some [Rhone blends](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Rhone%20blend) and later expanded the category to include any [expensive blend](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/inexpensive%20blend). Over the course of the year, my two favorite inexpensive blends turned out to be the $8 Oakley Five Reds (the 2003 vintage is a blend of 41% syrah, 27% zinfandel, 22% petite sirah, 10% [alicante bouschet](http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/alicante.htm), and 1% mourvedre from [Cline Cellars](http://www.clinecellars.com/)); and the 2005 vintage of The Hermit Crab from [D’Arenberg](http://www.blogger.com/70%25%20viognier%20and%2030%25%20marsanne), a delicious $13 blend of 70% viognier and 30% marsanne.
