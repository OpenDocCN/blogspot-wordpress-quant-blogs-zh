    [team](http://www.geekosystem.com/ibm-black-team/) in some book a long time ago. 
    My view is that engineers should fear the [testing](http://blog.goyello.com/2010/03/12/a-legend-of-the-notorious-black-team/)
    team, and thus provide further emphasis on the important to BDD/TDD and such in
    the development cycle.  All too often the QA/[Testing](http://www.lookscloudy.com/2011/04/unintended-consequences-ibms-black-team/)
    team in an organisation is disconnected from the engineering team, with the net
    effect that engineering becomes sloppy about what they throw over the “wall”.
