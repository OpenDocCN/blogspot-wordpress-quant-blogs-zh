- en: We all spend most of our time creating strategies with the promise of “alpha”—excess
    returns adjusted for risk to some benchmark. The most desirable strategies for
    many traders/investors are tactical asset allocation models because they are easy
    to implement and tend to be more reliable than capitalizing on short-term effects
    that are constantly in flux. One of the “founding fathers” of tactical asset allocation
    was Mebane Faber [http://www.mebanefaber.com/2009/02/19/a-quantitative-approach-to-tactical-asset-allocation-updated/](http://www.mebanefaber.com/2009/02/19/a-quantitative-approach-to-tactical-asset-allocation-updated/).
    He showed the utility of using long-term moving averages to trade various asset
    classes. This simple approach worked very well both in and out of sample, and
    also managed to preserve capital. Some of his other papers validated other academic
    work showing the utility of momentum/relative strength to choose between asset
    classes as well. Jeff Pietsch of ETF Prophet [http://etfprophet.com/](http://etfprophet.com/) has
    written about several different types of relative strength models for broad asset
    classes—many of them worth reading. There are also some basic models offered to
    follow on the site.  Michael Stokes at MarketSci [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/) also
    has published  research and has a monthly model for investors to follow. All of
    the models above use return or price inputs in order to predict 1) whether an
    asset is likely to have a positive or negative return and 2) which assets will
    perform the best in the future.  In a sense, both models are dependent on forecasting
    either absolute or relative  returns and/or prices. If the past doesn’t predict
    the future, then such models fail to produce alpha.

- en: But what should be the benchmark for such strategies? I would argue that a fair
    benchmark would be a model that is “forecast-free”– in the sense that it does
    not extrapolate returns or prices. Such a model would be also risk neutral and
    seek to maximize diversification. In the absence of opinions about relative returns,
    we would seek to treat each asset class equally and reduce the dependency or correlation
    between them. This portfolio would be agnostic to relative returns, and theoretically
    should be optimal if the market was truly efficient. As it turns out, such a portfolio
    does a lot better than you might expect—-implying that 1) assets are much more
    efficiently priced than we think 2) tactical asset allocation models offer varying
    “beta” payoffs– a) they either reduce downside risk (unfavorable beta) while preserving
    the upside (favorable beta) similar to trend-following models using moving averages
    and cash holdings –for a good overview of the literature read Automated Trading
    Systems [http://www.automated-trading-system.com/](http://www.automated-trading-system.com/) ,
    or  b) they create beta through relative asset selection— dynamically increasing
    leverage in up markets by selecting the most volatile assets, and subsequently
    reduce leverage by selecting the least volatile assets in down markets.

    variants that I like to term the “Minimum Correlation Algorithm.” It is perhaps
    the most robust model or “system” that I have ever tested– in the sense that it
    is largely invariant to the selection of assets or parameter values and furthermore
    it performs very well on a risk-adjusted basis. Below is a simple test using 8
    major asset classes/indices including: 1) S&P500 2) Nasdaq 100 3) Russell 2000
    4) MSCI EAFE (Europe, Asia and Far-East) 5) Long-term Treasury Bonds 6) Real Estate
    and 7) Gold.  Note that rebalancing was done on a weekly basis and quarterly data
    was used within the algorithm to estimate correlations.'

    pretty good doesn’t it? Notice that this method often performs very well in difficult
    times (like this month!). It is hard to believe that this strategy is always invested
    in the market and does not care whether assets are going up or down. Considering
    this is not a “system” of any sort, nor does it rely on parameters or multiple
    assumptions about market inefficiencies, it is truly an impressive result. It
    turns out that Markowitz was right– diversification is where it is at. Consider
    these results all the more impressive as correlations between assets have been
    increasing since 2000\.  To me this is the true benchmark for a tactical asset
    allocation strategy– the sharpe ratio of such a strategy should exceed that of
    the “forecast-free” approach in order to justify the risk, not to mention the
    fact that such strategies rely substantially on specific parameters that are constantly
    in flux (ie 10-month sma or 12 month roc).'

- en: I am not advocating against active management or tactical asset allocation.
    In fact I believe there are ways to dramatically improve upon such models using
    heuristic portfolio algorithms. This is a topic I will cover at some point in
    the future- perhaps in a white paper.  I am merely suggesting that the backtests
    of tactical models are not quite as impressive in light of the fact that you can
    probably do better looking both at in-sample and out-of-sample by sticking with
    a more robust approach of just diversifying intelligently. There are many further
    applications of this approach– one of the most obvious is to diversify among different
    trading systems or investment managers. A less obvious application would be to
    use the algorithm to create  “learning ensembles” that blend different system
    signals into one composite voting mechanism or trading signal.
