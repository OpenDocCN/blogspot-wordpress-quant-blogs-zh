- en: These are often semantic debates. I don't think the CRA caused the crisis, as
    in if the CRA legislation had not existed the crisis would not have happened.
    Yet it was symptomatic of the mindset that led to the crisis. The zeitgeist suggested
    that lowering underwriting criteria for homeowners was costless, turn renters
    with their various social and economic deficiencies into homeowners with their
    various social and economic proficiency, and be morally just. The mindset that
    underlay the CRA, not the CRA itself, caused the housing crisis. The CRA was joined
    by the Fair Housing Act and other explicit legislation. The regulators from the
    OFHEO, OCC, FDIC, SEC, and Federal Reserve were all on board with the tactics
    consistent with the strategy, meaning that bankers weren't criticized for lowering
    their standards in regards to home lending, but rather congratulated. The US Department
    of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Justice had similar objectives
    and initiatives to those in the CRA. The CRA, in this context, was unnecessary.

    And there are few, if any, permanent victories. Progress has been made in fair
    lending and community reinvestment, but that progress is threatened, as the rise
    of predatory lending in recent years demonstrates. Homeownership may be at record
    levels today, but low-income and minority neighborhoods remain underserved. Future
    goals for community reinvestment and fair lending seem reasonably clear, as do
    the tactics and strategies for achieving them. Sustaining the type of efforts
    responsible for past victories and required for future ones remains the challenge
    of the day.
