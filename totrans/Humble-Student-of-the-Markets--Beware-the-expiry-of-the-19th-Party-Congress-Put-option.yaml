    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    take a genius to understand that any bureaucrat who creates conditions that causes
    either a growth slowdown or financial instability during this critical period
    will have made his own life very difficult. In effect, Beijing has given a 19th
    Party Congress put option to the market, where nothing bad would be permitted
    to happen to the economy ahead of the meeting.
