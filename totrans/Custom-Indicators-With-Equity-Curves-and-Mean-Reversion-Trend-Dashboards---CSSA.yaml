- en: As a side note,  due to many private requests CSS Analytics is now offering
    customized indicators and dashboards for both Amibroker and Tradestation. Typically
    this is an institutional solution, but it is now available also to individuals.
    This involves creating indicators with equity curve monitors and regime filters
    fully built in, or creating custom indicators or dashboards based on the specs
    provided. The end result is that you have an easy to use and complete platform
    to monitor and adjust your trading. Complete support on product use and development
    is also provided. Please direct any inquiries to me personally at [dmvaradi@gmail.com](mailto:dmvaradi@gmail.com)
