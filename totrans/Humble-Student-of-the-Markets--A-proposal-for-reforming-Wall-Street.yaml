    not reward what most people consider "intelligence" -- advanced mathematics ability,
    or knowing or caring about the difference between Shia and Sunni.

    fund, are asymmetric. If things go right, the investment banker, broker or hedge
    fund manager gets a disproportionate part of the upside and the investor gets
    a limited part. If things go wrong, the investor bears virtually all of the downside.

    bank. Let Goldman Sachs and all the i-banks be partnerships again. That way, it’s
    the partners’ money again. If the partners want to lever the balance sheet up
    to 30-1 or 40-1, let them. If it doesn’t work, the partners get personally wiped
    out and some may have to declare personal bankruptcy. In the end, the return function
    becomes symmetric and the net aggregate effects will be positive. I don’t believe
    that partners of i-banks would collectively be willing to take those kinds of
    risks again, nor would they be willing to sacrifice long-term liability for short-term
    profits.
