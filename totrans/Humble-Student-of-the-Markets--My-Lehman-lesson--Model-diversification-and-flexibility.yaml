    Other major industrialized countries (and the eurozone in particular) experienced
    their own financial crisis and global central bankers went into crisis mode. The
    balance sheets of the ECB, BoE, BoJ and other central banks expanded to stratospheric
    levels in response. In that case, shouldn't the effects show up in inflation rather
    than then the exchange rate? Inflation, as measured by the CPI, has been extremely
    tame. What about commodity inflation? Shouldn't it show up as commodity inflation?
    Well, sort of. As the chart below shows, commodity prices (in black) did rise
    in the wake of the global financial crisis, but so did stock prices (in red).
    Commodity prices peaked out in early 2011, but stock prices have continued to

    The deep capital stock of the economy — including fixed capital, organizational
    capital, and what Arnold Kling describes as “patterns of sustainable specialization
    and trade” — was simply unprepared for the firehose of new workers. The nation
    faced a simple choice: employ them, and accept a lower rate of production per
    worker, or insist on continued productivity growth and tolerate high unemployment.
    Wisely, I think, we prioritized employment. But there was a bottleneck on the
    supply-side of the economy. Employed people expect to enjoy increased consumption
    for their labors, and so put pressure on demand in real terms. The result was
    high inflation, and would have been under any scenario that absorbed the men,
    and the women, of the baby boom in so short a period of time. Ultimately, the
    1970s were a success story, albeit an uncomfortable success story. Going Volcker
    in 1973 would not have worked, except with intolerable rates of unemployment and
    undesirable discouragement of labor force entry. By the early 1980s, the goat
    was mostly through the snake, so a quick reset of expectations was effective.'
