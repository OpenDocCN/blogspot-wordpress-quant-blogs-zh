- en: In the Dr. Seuss children's story, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", the Grinch
    is a grouchy character who conspired to steal all the Christmas presents from
    the nearby village. He later has a change of heart and returns all the gifts and
    participates in the villagers' Christmas celebrations.

    last week in the form of a market pullback accompanied by weak breadth and negative
    momentum, capped by Omicron shutdown fears and disappointment over delays of Biden's
    Build Back Better fiscal stimulus program.
