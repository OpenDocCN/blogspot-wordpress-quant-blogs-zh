    efforts to put a massive [short squeeze](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20squeeze)
    on the likes of [GME](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GME), [AMC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AMC),
    [BBY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BBY), [EXPR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EXPR),
    [KOSS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KOSS), [BB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BB),
    etc., it was just a matter of time before this same short squeeze template was
    applied to ETPs.  On January 28^(th), silver became a short squeeze target and
    the primary silver ETP, [SLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SLV),
    was suddenly in the crosshairs and trading volume spiked about 10x.

    of Bloomberg summarized the developments in the TVIXF short squeeze attempt in
    the aptly titled, [A Onetime Giant of Volatility Has Gone Haywire in OTC Trading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-one-time-giant-of-volatility-has-gone-haywire-in-otc-trading?sref=f1XuD40B). 
    Peterseil noted that only 7% of TVIXF’s outstanding shares have been sold short,
    which dramatically limits the potential success for a short squeeze.  In the article,
    I am quoted as not being surprised that an attempt was made to squeeze the TVIXF
    shorts given the success of previous short squeeze efforts, but I also note that
    an effort to squeeze the shorts is very risky for longs in that the last time
    there was a similar undertaking, Credit Suisse declared an acceleration event
    and crushed the longs.  It is the risk of an acceleration event that forces the
    price to the [indicative value](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)
    (IV) – a feature that is unique to ETPs and does not apply to single stocks –
    that makes shorting ETPs much riskier.

- en: The historical reference above is to [DGAZF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DGAZF),
    which went from about 400 to about 25,000 in one week during a short squeeze in
    August 2020 when the indicative value was near 200.  The decoupling of the market
    price on the OTC from indicative value was in large part due to the cessation
    of the ability to generate new creation units and thus the ability to use shorts
    to arbitrage any difference between the market price and indicative value.  With
    large losses incurred by investors and the associated bad publicity, Credit Suisse
    elected to accelerate DGAZF.   As noted above, the acceleration of the note was
    executed at the indicative value price, *not* the market price:  “As described
    in the Pricing Supplement, investors will receive a cash payment per ETN equal
    to the arithmetic average of the closing indicative values of the ETNs during
    the accelerated valuation period.”  As a result of the acceleration to the indicative
    value, investors who saw DGAZF trade at 125x its indicative value were exposed
    to a 99.2% loss.

    the same language regarding acceleration at indicative value as DGAZ, with the
    pricing supplement noting no less than a dozen times that in an acceleration event,
    the redemption price reverts to indicative value rather than the market price.

    of creation units sounds familiar, this is not the first time it has happened
    to TVIX.  I covered the initial instance of the suspension of creation units in
    TVIX at length back in 2012, when most investors were still not familiar with
    the intricacies of indicative value, creation units, the potential for short squeezes
    and the potential for market prices to decouple dramatically from indicative value.

- en: In the graphic below, I show the recent uncoupling of TVIXF from TVIX.IV (TVIX’s
    indicative value) and the premium that has developed as a result of the short
    squeeze peaking at 44% on Monday and falling back to 29% as of today.  The key
    takeaway for longs is that at any point in time, Credit Suisse can do as they
    did with DGAZF and declare an accelerating event, forcing the distorted OTC market
    price back down to indicative value in a hurry.
