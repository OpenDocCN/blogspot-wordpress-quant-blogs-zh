- en: some work (in progress) by Stefan Thurner and colleagues exploring how leverage
    influences stability (price volatility) in a competitive, speculative market.
    Thurner spoke about this at a meeting on Tipping Points in Durham, UK. What I
    find most appealing about this work is that is explores this question with a model
    that is rich enough to exhibit many of the basic features we see in speculative
    markets -- competition between hedge funds and other investment firms to attract
    investors' funds, the use of leverage to amplify potential gains, the monitoring
    of leverage by banks who lend to the investment firms, occasional abrupt crashes
    and bankruptcies, etc.

    for thinking. But it is arguably better than anything else we currently have for
    running "policy experiments" to test what might happen in such a market if regulators
    take this or that step -- establishing tight limits to allowed leverage, for example.

- en: Stefan kindly sent me the slides from his talk, a few of which I'd like to mention
    here. As I said, this is work in progress, so these are preliminary results. They're
    interesting because they suggest that avoiding dangerous market instability through
    leverage limits comes with costs, and that our intuition isn't at all a reliable
    guide -- we need these kinds of models in which we can discover surprising outcomes
    (before we discover them in reality).

    years, and it now reproduces a number of realistic market behaviors quite naturally.
    Thurner summarized these as follows:'

- en: In other words, the hedge funds act to eliminate mis-pricings (taking volatility
    out of the market), and profit by doing so. Funds have to be aggressive to survive
    in the face of stuff competition, but suffer if they get too large. Risks shorten
    the lifetime of a fund. Overall, the models also reproduces the right statistical
    fluctuations in the market.

- en: ', competition between hedge funds leads naturally to increasing leverage and
    drives the market to have a fat-tailed distribution of returns; it becomes subject
    (like real market) to large price fluctuations as a matter of course driven by
    its own internal dynamics (no external impacts required). In this condition, the
    market is highly prone to catastrophic crashes triggered by nothing by small price
    fluctuations linked to noise traders (unsophisticated investors buying and selling
    more or less at random). The figure below shows a typical example, plotting the
    wealth of various funds versus time, with a dramatic crash that affects all funds
    at once (different colors for different funds):'

- en: Now, a natural question is -- could these kinds of events be avoided with proper
    regulations? One idea would be to restrict the amount of leverage allowed with
    the aim of keeping the market returns in a mode Gaussian regime, i.e. eliminating
    fat tails. People could probably argue for decades about whether this would work
    or not without coming to an answer; this model makes it possible to do an experiment
    to find out, which is what Thurner and colleagues have done.

    The different colors correspond to different possible regulatory regimes, and
    show how behavior changes with maximum allowed hedge fund leverage : BLUE (no
    other regulations), PALE GREEN (regulations akin to Basel I and II, in which banks
    loaning to hedge funds are restricted by capital requirements) and RED (a situation
    in which banks monitor hedge funds and reduce a hedge fund''s allowed leverage
    below the maximum when the volatility in its assets grows; a kind of adaptive
    leverage control).'

    use of volatility, actually benefits the market -- making it more efficient (in
    one sense).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The figure shows the mean square price volatility versus allowed leverage. Increasing
    leverage lets the hedge funds pounce on opportunities more aggressively and wipe
    out mis-pricings more effectively. Die hard free market people should love this
    as it shows that the effect is strongest in the absence of any regulation. The
    regulated markets require higher leverage to get the same reduction in volatility.

    (per unit time) of a failure of one of the hedge funds:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here the pure free market solution isn't so good, as this probability rises
    rapidly with increasing leverage. There is a relatively low value of leverage
    (around 5 in the model's units) where the market benefits of leverage have already
    been realized, and more leverage only leads to more failures (because it takes
    the market into the regime of fat-tailed returns; this can happen even if the
    mean square volatility remains small).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The regulated markets in this case perform marginally better -- the regulations
    reduce the number of failures, and the cost for this is marginally increased volatility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A surprising outcome is that these same regulations, in the regime of very high
    leverage, actually do worse than no regulations at all -- they lead to higher
    market volatility AND more failures as well, a truly perverse regime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All in all, then, this model offers a sobering perspective on how regulators
    might go about trying to avoid crashes linked to fat tails by limiting leverage.
    Some limitation clearly seems to be good. But too much can be bad, especially
    when coupled with other market regulations. You can't test out one idea in isolation,
    because they interact in surprising ways.

    work in progress, as is my understanding of it -- and of what it means for the
    bigger picture.
