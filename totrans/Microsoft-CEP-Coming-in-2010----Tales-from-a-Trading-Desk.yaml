    applications have become increasingly important. Event-driven applications are
    characterized by high event data rates, standing queries, and millisecond latency
    requirements that make it impractical to persist the data in a database before
    it is processed. These requirements are shared by various scenarios across verticals
    such as manufacturing, oil and gas, power utilities, financial services as well
    as IT and data center monitoring. In this session we explore technology from the
    Microsoft SQL Server flight of products that covers these scenarios and addresses
    those requirements. The session discusses use cases in depth and explains how
    key components of the Microsoft All Data Platform can be used to build domain-specific
    solutions. As part of the session, we also go over various deployment alternatives
    and key dates of the product roadmap.
