    Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory)” is the perfect
    accompaniment to my nearly finished post on ever shrinking VIX numbers and the
    warping of our collective sense of time decay…when I decide to visit one of my
    [favorite options blogs](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/).  I pause for a second,
    then do a double take.  Oops, that must be my draft post I pulled up by mistake.  No,
    it turns out I am having a surrealist moment of my own.  Dali’s melting clocks
    appeared on the other blog just minutes before they were scheduled to appear on
    mine.

    the Deutsche Börse has a new [VDAX](http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/trading_members/45_Indices/36_volatility_indices/80_VDAX?module=InOverview_Index&wp=DE000A0DMX99&foldertype=_Index&wplist=DE000A0DMX99&active=overview&timespan=1d)
    (aka VDAX-NEW) and an old [VDAX](http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/trading_members/45_Indices/36_volatility_indices/80_VDAX?active=overview&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;module=InOverview_Index&wp=DE0008467408&wplist=DE0008467408&foldertype=_Index&wpbpl=ETR).  The
    biggest distinction between the two is that VDAX-NEW is calculated from the implied
    volatility in the [DAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX) (German counterpart
    to the DJIA) options looking out 30 days while the original VDAX looks ahead 45
    days.

    the second chart, the red dotted line and solid ‘best fit’ line for that data
    series represent the difference between the VDAX and the VIX as a percentage of
    the VDAX.  This difference between the VDAX and the VIX shows that at least over
    the past year or so, volatility has been dissipating in US markets faster than
    in the German markets.

    and international markets, it should come as no surprise that the <country-region

    with foreign markets usually reacting to changes in the <country-region st="on"><place
    st="on">US</place></country-region>.  Writing in 2003, [Sofiane Aboura](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=101097)
    concludes in *[International Transmission of Volatility: A Study on the Volatility
    Indexes VX1, VDAX and VIX](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=514282)*that
    “the information flow contained in the VIX is globally transferred the same day
    to the VX1 *[derived from the [CAC 40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_40)]*
    while it is diffused the two first days to the German market through the VDAX.
    We note again the contemporaneous relationships between the <place st="on"><country-region
    st="on">US</country-region></place> and the French implied volatility indexes.”'
