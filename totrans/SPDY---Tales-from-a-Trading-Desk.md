## SPDY

If you don’t know what SPDY is, then have a read [here](http://www.chromium.org/spdy). mod_spdy deails [here](https://code.google.com/p/mod-spdy/), coupled with a view on potential speedup.  Facebook has [recently](http://zoompf.com/2013/03/facebook-adds-spdy-support) turned on support for SPDY.  Looks like IE 11 will provide SPDY [support](http://withinwindows.com/within-windows/2013/4/1/blues-clues-internet-explorer-11-getting-spdy-support).
