    recently on [broker APIs](http://www.maxdama.com/2009/11/thoughts-on-apis-ib-lime-wex.html).
    In his most recent post he drops an intriguing aside when commenting on IB, Wex
    and Lime: “I haven’t used each of the three’s FIX APIs”'

    this stuff yourself.'

    than the buy side. It seems from Max’s posts that he’s doing connectivity work
    for hedge funds building automated trading systems using the broker APIs he mentions.
    I’d be interested to know more about why those firms choose to use the proprietary
    APIs…
