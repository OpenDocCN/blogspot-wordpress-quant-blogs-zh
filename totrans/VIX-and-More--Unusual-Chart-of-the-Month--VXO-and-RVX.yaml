    for the fun of it.  I will gladly enter a guilty plea on that one. In fact, I
    enjoy cajoling the Department of Strange and Unusual Charts to come up with something
    that readers have never encountered before.

    disorder I have already confessed to.  Before trying to interpret whether the
    chart has any possible validity, it is important to take a step back.  Consider
    that each chart contains at least one hypothesis about a relationship between
    various data points and/or data sets.  At first glance that hypothesis might seem
    outrageous or merely coincidental.  The point of the strange and unusual charts
    is that it is more important to drag those hypotheses out into the open and give
    readers an opportunity to pause and reflect on them than it is to present each
    hypothesis as unassailable .

    sees, but which persist over time, that provide a meaningful trading edge.  So
    keep an open mind and keep looking.

- en: Turning to the ratio of the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)
    to the [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX), recall that the
    VXO is the ‘[original VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html)’
    and reflects the volatility associated with the large cap S&P 100 index (OEX).  The
    RVX, on the other hand, is the volatility index for the Russell 2000 small cap
    index (RUT).  Small caps have been outperforming large caps lately, so it is not
    surprising to see recent volatility trending higher with the large caps.  What
    did surprise me, however, was to see that a spike in the VXO relative to the RVX
    has been an excellent indicator of market bottoms over the past two years.  If
    we extrapolate from the past, the current levels of the VXO versus the RVX also
    suggest a likely intermediate market bottom, at least in the SPX, which is represented
    by a gray area chart in the graph.  Unassailable?  No.  Worth watching going forward?  Absolutely.
