- en: GE is one of America's most successful companies, and has a large finance division
    that relies crucially on its AAA rating to get business, and cheap funding. The
    AAA rating is a competitive advantage that is hard to duplicate. It has paid an
    annual dividend since 1899, and has not had a year where they lost money in decades.

- en: 'But the worldwide recession, and potential write-downs in its finance unit,
    put this at risk. Its implied volatility is around 80 as its price fell over 50%
    in the past year and realized volatility often hit the 100% annualized level.
    Its spread to Treasuries out 5 years is about 326 basis points, which is really
    bizarre, a spread that most junk bonds had in 2006\. The biggest risk factor for
    a AAA company, is showing that it isn''t a sure thing on the profit front. This
    is much more material that the leverage. Indeed, I know many people in financial
    restructuring, and their pitch is pretty simple: you have 100% equity, why not
    swap 50% of that with debt, and get the same profits at half the capital! You
    can buy a big house with the proceeds and still have control, and get about the
    same dividend. Sure, the interest expense goes up, but not much. I imagine Microsoft
    will adopt this strategy at some point in the next 10 years (it has zero debt),
    and anticipating this currently buffets the stock.'

  zh: 但全球性衰退，加上其金融部门潜在的减值，使其处于风险之中。其隐含波动率约为 80，因其股价在过去一年大幅下跌，实现波动率通常会达到 100% 的年化水​平。其
    5 年期国债利差约为 326 基点，这真是奇怪，大多数垃圾债券在 2006 年的时候才有这样的利差。AAA 公司最大的风险因素，是表明在盈利方面并非十拿九稳。在这方面，这比杠杆更为关键。实际上，我认识很多金融重组的人，他们的说法很简单：你有
    100% 的权益，为什么不用其中的 50% 换取债务，然后用一半的资本获得相同的利润！你还可以用收益买一栋大房子，并且仍然拥有控制权，和获得大致相同的股息。当然，利息支出会增加，但并不多。我想微软在未来
    10 年内会采用这一策略（它没有任何债务），而当前对此的预期会影响股价。

- en: calculations show that an exogenous increase in debt from 0 to 50% is pretty
    immaterial on the probability of default for a profit making company, so debt
    buyers are willing to facilitate such a deal. But it is the income that is key
    to GE's plumb financial status, and I don't think there is much they can do here.
    I would hate to see GE issue shares, because I think that would have a second
    order effect on its debt rating, because it won't help if GE actually posts an
    income loss next year. It's all income, not leverage, for GE, at this point, and
    I doubt there is much Immelt can do, top down, to affect this strategically.

  zh: 计算表明，对于盈利的公司来说，从 0% 的债务到 50% 的外生债务增加对违约概率并不会产生太大影响，因此债务买家愿意促成这样的交易。但对于 GE 而言，收入才是其良好财务状况的关键，而我认为他们在这方面无太多可以做的。我不愿意看到
    GE 发行股票，因为我认为这会对其债务评级产生第二阶效应，因为如果 GE 实际在明年出现亏损，发行股票也不会有帮助。目前，对 GE 而言，关键是收入，而不是杠杆，我怀疑
    Immelt 在战略上几乎无能为力。
