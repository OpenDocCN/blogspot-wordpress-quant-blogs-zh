- en: The idea that the debate is between no regulation vs. good ones is a caricature,
    but it's the conviction of many. These people have no understanding of how many
    different rules exist, and that there's a difference between less regulation and
    zero.  As regulations proliferate it's impossible to enforce them all fairly,
    and so enforcement becomes selective and capricious. Legislative micromanagement
    is the road to crony capitalism, why so many senior risk managers at large private
    institutions are ex- government officials with some connections with the regulators.
