    that helping someone else although incurring some cost for this act, could have
    evolved since it increases the chance that such niceness might be returned some
    day. This really expanded the conception of self-interest to be semantically indistinguishable
    from altruism in many cases. Biologists have observed this

    than they really are, using data on what 'good looking faces' look like. Looking
    at fMRI data, we actually recognize ourselves in pictures faster when we are about
    20% better looking than we really are (they had models that generated statistically
    validated better and worse refinements to pictures). In other words, we really
    think we look better than we actually do.

    toys while a researcher left them alone. Most of the children did look, of course,
    and most lied about it. Interestingly, the higher the IQ of the child, the more
    often they lied.

    world so that we might more easily get our way with others. This involves constantly
    inflating our acheivements and abilities, and playing down our failings and rationalizing
    our mistakes. You are a better liar to others if you first lie to yourself. Lying
    to others and ourselves is evolutionarily selected for the same way that pale
    skin is selected for in northern latitudes. [The video is better than the book.

    for highly volatile stocks. We know people are overconfident, where most of us
    think we are better drivers, leaders, etc., and one prominent mechanism is that
    the higher the volatility of the stocks, the greater the disagreement, the more
    these miscalibrated optimists overbuy, which pushes down stock returns. Thus,
    understanding why people are overconfident is important.

    Intellectually, it lacks the knowledge and honesty that comes with wisdom, where
    one recognizes we are neither as good as our mothers think, nor as bad as our
    enemies think. Thus, I've always been a little perplexed by the idea that

    need several beers to initiate various courting rituals. While I understood that
    confidence was sexy, something I wanted to be, I couldn't fake it because I couldn't
    understand why something was both ignorant and desirable.

    like Woody Allen and Allen Brooks too. Girls don't like overconfident boys merely
    because they miscalibrated. The key is the nature of one's overconfidence. People
    who are confident about the future continue trying, even when it's hard. They
    assume the good faith of others, which makes for good first impressions. People
    like optimists because they tend to be less defensive, less easy to offend, and
    so easier to be around. Optimism is related to positive reframing and a tendency
    to accept the situation's reality, because optimists see the silver lining to
    problems. Optimists are copers, and pessimists defeatists. It is not confidence
    in specifics, but in the future, their future, that makes people attractive, and
    this is a rational disposition. A confident person need not be miscalibrated,
    though they often are, but rather, their confidence is really simple optimistism
    about their life in general.

    We should see the future brightly because if we simply do the best we can things
    will work out as well as they can. To the extent things are out of our control
    and work against us, it doesn't help us to worry about such matters. Insecurity
    on the other hand leads to pettiness, which is why we find such characteristics
    so unappealing (eg, insecurity led Anakin Skywalker to The Dark Side, and presumably
