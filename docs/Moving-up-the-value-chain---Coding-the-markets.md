## 上升价值链

### June 25, 2009

[Tales](http://mdavey.wordpress.com) [makes an interesting point](http://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/trading-sales-people-and-scalability/) on the problem of scaling up a people intensive dealer/broker activity: sales coverage of clients. He considers the problem from the perspective of scaling up the number of clients an individual sales person can cover. In my experience there’s another angle – moving up the value chain. I see dealers attempting to strip out cost by putting more of their vanilla flow business on electronic channels: [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com), [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com), [Caplin](http://www.caplin.com) based single dealer platforms. In my world that flow is European Govt Bonds, US Treasuries, vanilla swaps. Autoquoting, autonegotiation and STP mean that trades are priced, executed and settled with no manual intervention. A big advance on the voice trading of 10 years ago. A few years back I was toubleshooting on the desk when I heard one of our market making traders refuse to take a client voice inquiry for a small ticket, he just said “do it on Bloomberg !”

使用标准流程在电子通道上，销售和交易可以专注于更高利润的结构化交易，从而提高盈利能力。当然，不断竞争的压力在退缩。那些曾经是定制语音交易的商品现在变成了电子交易：例如飞蝇、定制掉期、定制结构。
