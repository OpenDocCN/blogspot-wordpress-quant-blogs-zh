# Humble Student of the Markets: Is this how a currency war begins?

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/is-this-how-currency-war-begins.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/is-this-how-currency-war-begins.html#0001-01-01)

**前言：解释我们的市场时机模型**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**终极市场时机模型**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[构建终极市场时机模型](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**趋势模型**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**交易模型**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa).

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

**是在不知不觉中走向货币战争吗？**

As we look ahead to the FOMC meeting next week, it may be the start of a synchronized global easing cycle. The ECB signaled a dovish tone last week at its meeting. The EURUSD exchange rate weakened, and the USD Index strengthened. From a technical perspective, the USD is exhibiting bullish patterns on multiple time frames. The index staged an upside breakout on an inverse head and shoulders formation on the daily chart, with an upside measured upside target of about 99.10\. Conversely, EURUSD has broken down in a head and shoulders, with a downside target of about 110.

在周线图上，它也形成了可能的看涨双底和头肩底形态，如果突破，上方目标为 107.70 至 108.00。

此外，贸易加权美元也形成了可能的双底和头肩底形态，追溯到 2002 年，具有看涨的含义。

全球范围内看似协调的中央银行宽松政策引发了这样一个问题：货币政策是否无意中开始了一轮竞争性贬值周期。货币战争就是这样开始的吗？

我们从三个主要货币和贸易集团的视角来探讨这一论点，分别是欧洲、中国和美国。
