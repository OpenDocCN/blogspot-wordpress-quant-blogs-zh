# VIX and More: Post-Election Risk Trending Up in Treasuries and the Euro, Down in U.S. Stocks

> 来源：[`vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/11/post-election-risk-trending-up-in.html#0001-01-01`](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/11/post-election-risk-trending-up-in.html#0001-01-01)

You can always tell when the crowd gets long the VIX and ends up on the wrong side of the trade.  “The VIX is broken!” becomes an oft-repeated refrain, as does “The markets are rigged!” and the usual list of exhortations from those who are in denial.  The current line of thinking is that the world must be much more dangerous, risky and uncertain as a result of a Trump victory, yet the VIX is actually down 31.4% since the election – ipso facto the VIX is broken.

While I have more than a small soft spot in my heart for the VIX, I will be the first to point that taking an Americentric, equity-centric view of the investment landscape is dangerous and naïve.  More often than not, the issues that end up having a strong influence on the VIX are born on foreign soil and/or in other asset classes.  Just look at the recent history in

When it comes to looking at implied volatility indices as a

In the graphic below, I have isolated a handful of volatility indices that cut across asset classes and geographies to show how these have moved in the eight days following the election.  Note that Treasuries (

) have been trending steadily higher since the election as uncertainty related to the future of inflation and interest rates in the U.S. has risen, while the relationship that the Trump Administration will have with our NATO allies and the European Union is also somewhat murkier.

总体来看，在隐含波动性、风险和不确定性方面，情况是喜忧参半的。像往常一样，风险在某些资产类别中升高，比如国债和欧元。在其他领域，比如美国股市——及其 VIX 指数计——有赢家和输家，结果是净看涨预期使股指隐含波动性降低。这并不是说特朗普政府——其内阁成员和政策优先顺序在此时 largely unknown——不会在某些领域增加风险。更多的风险确实在酝酿之中，如果历史能提供任何指导，那么以美国为中心、以股市为中心的投资世界可能很难及时识别这些风险。
