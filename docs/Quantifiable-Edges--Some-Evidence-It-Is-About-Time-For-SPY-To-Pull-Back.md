# Quantifiable Edges: Some Evidence It Is About Time For SPY To Pull Back

> 来源：[`quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2014/01/some-evidence-it-is-about-time-for-spy.html#0001-01-01`](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2014/01/some-evidence-it-is-about-time-for-spy.html#0001-01-01)

SPY 目前已经连续 11 天收盘价未低于其 5 日均线，并在周二收盘时再创历史新高。下面研究的案例是我在过去几年中展示过几次的内容，最近一次是在 10 月。它研究了 SPY 至少交易于 5 日均线之上两周以上，并现在收盘于 10 日新高的情况。所有结果都已更新。

In the past this setup has commonly been followed by a short-term pullback. The downside edge doesn't last long, though. It seems to pretty much play itself out over the first 2 days.  It is not an overwhelming edge, but it is still worth noting that SPY has been short-term extended for a while and the normal course of action at this point is a little pullback.
