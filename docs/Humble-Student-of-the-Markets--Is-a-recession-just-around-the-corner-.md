# Humble Student of the Markets: Is a recession just around the corner?

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/09/is-recession-just-around-corner.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/09/is-recession-just-around-corner.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

+   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*

+   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*

+   Trading model: Bullish*

on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**My answer to Northy**

Recently, a lot of US macro economic releases has been coming in a bit on the soft side. As the chart below shows, stock prices have a high degree of correlation with the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether economic data is beating or missing expectations.

As a result, I am sensing a heightened level of anxiety among some of my readers. I have received several requests for comments to the macro post written by Sven Henrich, otherwise known as Northman Trader (Northy). In his post,

[Time to get real, Part II](https://northmantrader.com/2016/09/10/time-to-get-real-part-ii/)

北西为即将到来的经济衰退描绘了宏观视角。他正确地指出，经济衰退往往是牛市杀手，经常出现在总统任期的第一年。所以，随着宏观数据减弱，经济衰退是不是就在眼前？

与我回应北西关于经济衰退的帖子相结合，我认为适时回顾我的

指标的信息也是合适的。
