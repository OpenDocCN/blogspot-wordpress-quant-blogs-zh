# Magmasystems Blog: Get Rich Quick with KDB+

> 来源：[`magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/12/get-rich-quick-with-kdb.html#0001-01-01`](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/12/get-rich-quick-with-kdb.html#0001-01-01)

I am convinced that the world needs more

KDB

+ consultants. The supply of these creatures is so small, that if you end up needing one in a hurry, you probably have to go through

[First Derivatives](http://www.firstderivatives.com/)

.

KDB

+ is used by most of the Wall Street companies --- I can name

Citigroup

,

Barclays

, Bank of America, and Lehman as big

KDB+

users --- to store tick and order data.

KDB

+ 's biggest competitor is probably

Vhayu

.

The main blockade to learning

KDB

+ is their programming languages - K and Q - which can make

APL

look verbose!

If you are affected by the

upcoming

layoffs on Wall Street, and if you are looking for a new, exciting career change, and you don't relish the idea of selling steak knives door-to-door, then there is room in this world to be a

KDB

+ consultant.
