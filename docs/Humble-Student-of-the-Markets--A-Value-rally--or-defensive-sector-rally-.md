# Humble Student of the Markets: A Value rally, or defensive sector rally?

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-value-rally-or-defensive-sector-rally.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-value-rally-or-defensive-sector-rally.html#0001-01-01)

尽管上周五的失望的非农就业数据发布，但我对股市前景仍持相对乐观的态度。首先，市场一开盘就卖出了，但在收盘时反弹——这是一个积极的迹象。

Second, higher beta parts of the market have been outperforming in spite of the negative news. Consider this chart of the relative performance of small caps against the large caps indicating that the risk-on trade may not be done yet.

The risk-on rebound isn't just confined to the United States. Here is the performance of Greece compared to Europe, which is a key measure of risk aversion:

Here is the relative performance of Italy:

You get the idea.

**What about the defensive stock leadership?**

我在上周提到的一个警示信号是防御性部门取得的领导地位（请参见上周五收盘时）

[Something's not right about this rally](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/somethings-not-right-about-this-rally.html)

). I was not the only one to notice this effect. David Rosenberg mentioned it last Thursday and the

featured a comment from UBS on the curious leadership behavior:

> 正如 UBS 策略师乔纳森戈尔布（Jonathan Golub）所示，经典的防御部门，如医疗保健和消费品牌，率先在本年度的前三个月领跑，而一些更周期性的行业，如能源和技术，落后于榜单底部。

**Defensive leadership or Value leadership?**

There may be a more benign explanation for the leadership of defensive sectors. Value stocks have been outperforming Growth stocks since last June. The chart below of the relative performance of the Russell 1000 Value Index against the Russell 1000 Growth Index tells the story.

It just so happens that the Russell 1000 Value Index is overweight the kinds of sectors that have been outperforming, such as Financials and Utilities and the Russell 1000 Growth Index is overweight the sectors that have been lagging, such as the cyclically sensitive Industrials and Technology.

What's more, leadership in Value isn't just a sector effect. A contact of mine at MSCI Barra indicated to me that their factor analysis shows the performance of Value factors like Book to Price and Dividend yield to be outperforming as well. That outperformance was net of industry effects.

Bottom line: The upcoming Earnings Season will give us the best answer to the question of whether the real leadership is defensive stocks, which suggests caution, or Value stocks, which could be neutral to bullish.
