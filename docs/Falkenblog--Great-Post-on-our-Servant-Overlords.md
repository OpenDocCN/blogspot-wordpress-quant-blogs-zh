我常听到这样的论点：像爱德华·肯尼迪（周三去世，约翰·F·肯尼迪的兄弟）这样生于富贵与特权之中的人，因致力于为穷人服务、成为“公仆”（见下文 Blogging Heads）而应受到赞扬。但理想中的公仆，从统计学角度讲，不会整天试图对我发号施令。

While Kennedy didn’t choose a life of ease, he did something much worse: he chose a life of power. That choice satisfied an appetite that is far grosser, baser, and more anti-social than are any of the more private appetites that many rich people often choose to satisfy.
