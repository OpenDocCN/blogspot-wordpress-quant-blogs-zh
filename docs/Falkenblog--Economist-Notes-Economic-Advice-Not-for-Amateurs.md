writes that the

[masses should only trust PhD economists for their economic advice](http://alephblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Economics%20is%20Hard%20-%20Dont%20Let%20Bloggers%20Tell%20You%20Otherwise.pdf)

. As mathematics is the language of economics, and economists use a specific set of mathematical tools such as real analysis, method of moment estimators, and dynamic programming, these essential tools are clearly not understood by your average commentator, justifying this belief. Why listen to someone's opinion on the

if they don't know how to apply

? Insanity!

I agree these tools are essential, but I would add that they are not sufficient. So, readers should only trust PhD economists who understand these tools, and also the context in which they are applied. Having a couple business cycles worth of experience actually presenting micro and macro forecasts to CEOs and other key decision-makers, or running a portfolio that is marked to market, as also essential. As economists are primarily experts in models, applied to cherry-picked datasets that present cute results that showcase some novel cleverness, they are ignorant of the their ignorance. Their models are like the electric car, always just around the corner to viability. With hindsight, predicting business cycles--anything really--is very simple. You need someone who has been doing it in real time, with real feedback, giving you advice.

I therefore feel obligated to suggest that Obama

appoint me--and Falkenblog readers--gatekeeper of all economic opinion. Arguments my Star Chamber find invalid will be degoogled via an innovative JavaScript that will be mandated on all websites. Any page containing the keyword "cost" must have they keyword "benefit" on the same page, and vice versa. Any mention of effects must have heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors, even if the said effect is qualitative (further, one must spell that with a

). Presuming market oriented solutions assume perfect competition or perfect foresight, is no longer

但这只是针对非博士学位的人。至于普通的博士经济学家，提到乘数效应、规模递增，或者 IRA 代扣的默认选择也是不存在的。他们还必须提醒人们，“首席经济学家”是一个在自己组织内部没有影响力的公关职位，并且他们的母亲承认他们是医生，但“不是那种对你有用的医生”。宏观经济学家必须使用术语
