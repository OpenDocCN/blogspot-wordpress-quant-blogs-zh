# Humble Student of the Markets: Stocks want to go to the party, but bonds won't go in the car

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/stocks-want-to-go-party-but-bonds.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/stocks-want-to-go-party-but-bonds.html#0001-01-01)

**前言：解释我们的市场时机模型**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[构建终极市场时机模型](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

.

My inner trader uses a

**交易模型**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

Each model's latest signals are as follows:

+   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*

+   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*

+   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 11-Oct-2023)*

**趋势资产配置模型** last Thursday aptly characterized this market as “Stocks want to go to the party. But the bonds won’t get in the car.” I agree.

股市似乎正在享受基本面和技术面的顺风，但上升的国债收益率正在挤压股票和债券价格。实际上，标普 500 指数的前瞻性收益率与 10 年期国债收益率之间的差距自 2002 年以来从未如此之低。

这些估值压力会让股价下跌吗？债券市场又会怎样？
