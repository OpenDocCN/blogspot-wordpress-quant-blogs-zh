# Quantifiable Edges: Follow Through Days pt. 3 - Do They Miss Too Much of the Move?

由于美联储明天将召开会议，另一个波动的日子（下午 2:15 之后）似乎是确定的。CANSLIM 交易者将密切关注美联储是否能够帮助产生一个跟随日。标普 500 指数已经从上周的低点上涨了超过 7%。因此，我认为今晚是发布我关于 IBD 跟随日系列的第三部分的好时机：跟随日是否经常错过大部分行情或它们是否足够早地发出信号以捕捉行情的大部分？

Should you have missed the first few parts in the study on follow through days you may find them below:

[Intro](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/01/do-ibd-follow-through-days-provide.html) [Part 1 - Are They Predictive?](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/01/ibd-follow-through-days-pt-1-are-they.html)[Part 2 – Does Every Rally Have One?](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/01/follow-through-days-pt-2-does-every.html)

To determine whether they do a good job of catching a large portion of the rally, I first split all the 1% Follow Through Days into two groups – winners and losers. The test I used was the exact test described in part 1 using 1% Follow Through Days after an 8% market decline. I then measured how far from the bottom the market closed at on the follow through day. I am using the 1% Follow Through Day in this test rather than the 1.7% that IBD currently recommends due to the fact that

[the 1.7% requirement has had about a 20% chance of missing nearly the entire rally](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/01/follow-through-days-pt-2-does-every.html)

.

Interestingly, when I measured the distance from the low that the Follow Through Day closed, it seemed to have no affect on success or failure. For both winners and losers the average Follow Through Day closed about 5.2% higher than the recent low.

I then decided to examine just the Follow Through Days that worked to see how much the market typically gained on a bull move between December 1971 and now. The average bull move over the period was about 28.8%. This includes some fantastic moves such as the 64% market rise from 10/1990 to 2/1994\. Of the 35 “successful” Follow Through Days, 25 (71%) of them saw the market gain at least another 10% before correcting again.

Of course there is no chance of actually selling at the top and capturing the entire remaining portion of the move. If you assume the Follow Through Day gets you into a move 5.2% from the bottom and you will end up or missing out on the top third of the move, then on average each successful Follow Through Day would lead to a gain of nearly 14%.

使用第一部分描述的退出标准，失败的跟势交易日的平均损失将约为 5.6%。

由于有 55%的跟势交易日是“成功的”，按照上述假设，在跟势交易日收盘时购买标普 500 的预期收益是(0.55 * 14%) – (0.45 * 5.6%) = 5.18%。这个正面的预期值表明，跟势交易日能够抓住足够的行情变动，使其值得一试。

我在计算这些数字时忽略了一个重要的点，那就是大多数使用跟势交易日的交易者并不仅仅交易指数。股票选择和时机是 CANSLIM 的重要组成部分。如果他们的股票选择和时机比市场平均水平要好，那么他们可能会看到比预期 5.2%还要高的许多倍的收益。

所以总结一下——这是好消息。如果这是一个真正的牛市反弹，即使很快就会出现一个大的跟势交易日，也还有足够的空间赚钱。坏消息是，这并不是对跟势交易日的背书。这更多的是一个风险/收益分析的练习。虽然市场上平均放弃的 5.2%与潜在收益相比显得微不足道，但 5.2%仍然超过了标普在过去三年中的总回报中的两年。这不是一个小数目。幸运的是，如我在过去几周所展示的，替代方法可以帮助捕捉到那 5.2%的大部分。然而，对于没有更好方法识别市场底部交易者来说，IBD 跟势交易日似乎提供了一个不错的机会，以捕捉反弹的大部分。

我将继续我的系列文章《跟势交易日》，下一部分：小跌或大跌之后它们的效果更好吗？
