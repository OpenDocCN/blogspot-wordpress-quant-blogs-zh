# Quantitative Trading: Cointegration between oil and bond yield? Not!

An

in the Feb 1 issue of the Economist magazine suggested that there may be a link between crude oil price and long-dated US treasuries. Their reasoning is that if oil price is high, OPEC will need to re-invest the pile of cash that they generate, and eventually a lot of this ended up invested in US 10-year bond. Therefore, when crude prices go up, 10-year yield should go down. As I

before, the fact that these 2 numbers are anti-correlated do not prevent them from being

cointegrated

. And in fact, the Economist article plotted the crude oil prices together with bond yield over the last year together, and they seem tantalizingly close to being

cointegrated

.

My curiosity piqued, I proceeded to get a longer history of these data to examine.

In the graph above, I plotted the (normalized) difference between the 10-year treasury yield and oil price. One can see that over the last year and a half, they are indeed

cointegrated

to a good degree. (To see that, notice the spread is range-bound, or mean-reverting, from mid-2005 to the present.) But this relationship breaks down completely over the longer history.

Though I think that the Economist magazine is doing a disservice to its readers for plotting this graph over just one year and making

innuendos

of linkage, it is a nice illustration of the danger of studying

cointegration

over a short window.
