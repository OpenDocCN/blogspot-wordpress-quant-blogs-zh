# VIX and More: Divergence, History and Tells

> 来源：[`vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/divergence-history-and-tells.html#0001-01-01`](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/divergence-history-and-tells.html#0001-01-01)

![](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/strikeout-glanville.jpg)Some interesting things have been happening in the VIX this week.  Yesterday, I [recounted how the VIX jumped 8%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/unusual-vix-activity-of-april-23rd.html) on Monday while the SPX was almost flat.  By the end of the day yesterday, the SPX was up 1% and the VIX, which has generally been strongly negatively correlated with the SPX, was up .6%.

In the upside down world of the VIX, any time the SPX and the VIX are positively correlated, we have a divergence.  In this case I think it may be a significant divergence.

First, some quick history: from 1990 through 12/18/03, the SPX gained 1% or more on 480 occasions.  Of those 480 occasions, about 12% of the time the VIX was up on that day instead of down.  If you have just recently started paying attention to the VIX, as I have, that 12% number may sound high.  In fact, since 12/18/03, we have had 57 additional instances of a 1% SPX jump and *not one* of those rises in the SPX was accompanied by rising VIX – until yesterday.

-   现在一个数据点并不一定标志着一个转折点，但它确实为持续了 41 个月的模式画上了句号。事实上，如果你计算一个.120 击球手连续 56 次击球不中的概率，你会发现这种情况发生的频率不到 0.08%。
