# Magmasystems Blog: The Streambase Amnesty Program

> 来源：[`magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/03/streambase-amnesty-program.html#0001-01-01`](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/03/streambase-amnesty-program.html#0001-01-01)

Every since this morning, I have received a number of emails telling me of a new Streambase press release and asking me what I thought of it. It seems that Streambase

is trying to take advantage of the

Coraleri

merger in their

["Streambase Amnesty Program"](http://www.streambase.com/dda77f81-8491-4ed7-a4f8-ca26ce0574af/press-release-detail.htm)

.

And

Coraleri

may be making a mistake by

[公布](http://blog.aleri.com/an-open-letter-to-customers-and-the-event-processing-community/2009/03/11/) Streambase's

program.

When I first was alerted to

Streambase's

program by various people, I thought that it was yet one more instance of

Streambase's

questionable marketing practices.

But then I thought more and more about it, and now, I am not entirely sure if I would categorize it as something totally sleazy.

When Don and Terry told me of their plans to have two engines, the first thing that I told them was that it would result in confusion, and that in order to avoid confusion, NEW customers and prospects might shy away from

Coraleri

and go to another vendor like

Streambase

or

Apama

. They might even want to avoid smaller companies totally, and go with something safe like IBM or Oracle. And, I even stated this fact in my earlier blog posting on the

Coraleri

merger.

I know that

Streambase

are big readers of my blog, and they certainly picked up on this fact right away. And, they are using this to take advantage of the period of haziness that surrounds any merger.

I question the use of the word

"Amnesty"

. Amnesty usually implies forgiveness for someone who has committed a transgression. What transgression has a Coral8 or

Aleri

customer committed except not use

Streambase

? I'm sorry

Streambase

, but I don't think anyone needs your forgiveness. But it is very gracious of you to offer your beneficence to the Coraleri customers.

Streambase

has detected a weakness here in the marketplace, and is positioning itself to exploit it. Is this sleazy or is this simply an aggressive but honest business practice? Competitive upgrades happen all of the time in the business world. Companies are constantly trying to poach customers from each other by offering various kinds of incentives.

Let's examine the

Streambase

press release.

(Bile On)

The

Streambase

press release says:

“StreamBase received several enquiries on Monday from concerned customers."

Really? The combined

Coraleri

only has about 80 customers. There were actually customers who called you on Monday, the day of the merger? Everyone was that disturbed by the merger?

"StreamBase has designed a Best Practices Workshop for those investigating the migration process.

"

哇！自合并宣布以来仅用了两天时间就设计并完成了整个研讨会。工作效率真高！

《迁移最佳实践：从 Aleri SPLASH 或 Coral8 CCL 迁移到 StreamBase StreamSQL》是一个由 Richard Tibbetts 设计，由 StreamBase 的高级现场建筑师领导的研讨会。

你们的所有高级现场建筑师都成为了

CCL

在两天内将 Splash 迁移到 Streambase？相当令人印象深刻！

(Bile Off)

我确信

Streambase

已经对两者

Aleri

和 Coral8 多年来一直如此。大多数供应商都知道他们的竞争对手有什么能力。所以，我确信，在某种程度上，

Streambase

那些知道

CCL

和 Splash。我确信有些客户会评估

Streambase

，

Aleri

和 Coral8 并排放置，就像我们做的那样。像 Streambase 的 Steve Barber 这样的优秀现场工程师可能收到了来自

潜在客户

所有的像“我在 Coral8 中做了这个。我如何在

Streambase

？”我会质疑

Streambase

能够处理甚至 10 倍的工作量。

珊瑚 eri。

客户要求一次性进行转换。一次迁移可能需要 Steve Barber 几周的时间来完成。

尽管我不喜欢

Streambase 的

销售和营销组织，尽管我个人认为他们有时会轻率地处理事实，但我认为

Streambase

正在对他们

VC's

通过利用围绕互补产品合并的一些不确定性来获益。我相信大多数大公司都会这么做。

我希望 Don 和 Terry 以及 John 和 Jeff 已经完全考虑过了这个问题，但除非我看到一个完整的

路线图

来自

Coraleri

我将继续认为，由于整合，会有一定程度的风险出现。而且，我不能责怪马克·帕尔默在考虑这种情况时，认为可以从这里赚钱。我可能也会这么做....
