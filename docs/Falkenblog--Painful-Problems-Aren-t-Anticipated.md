# Falkenblog: Painful Problems Aren't Anticipated

> 来源：[`falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/painful-problems-arent-anticipated.html#0001-01-01`](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/painful-problems-arent-anticipated.html#0001-01-01)

2010 年 12 月大雪暴来临之前准备不充分，市长布隆伯格对 2008 年抵抗飓风艾琳准备充分过度消极，这导致纽约市只受到了较小的损失。这种情况相当典型，因为高估灾难在低估之后的成本／收益比是明显偏向于过度反应。只有当我们完全没有察觉时，不良事件通常才会真正造成严重破坏。

1999 年时，每个风险管理部门都为 Y2K 问题分配了大量资源：老式软件的双位日期将在年底崩溃。许多危言耸听者捏造了可信的假设性的、概括性的恐吓，并使所有人胆战心惊。结果证明这是一场无事的事件，即使没有准备也可能不会成为问题。

In 2009, with financial crisis fresh in people's minds, everyone was worried about immanent

，通过必要的再融资，建议几笔大额违约情况。逻辑看起来无可挑剔，但这些情况并未发生，因为有许多方法可以修改合同以消除真正危机的死亡权成本，我预测这个部门将解决这些问题，而没有任何严重的危机。

相比之下，请考虑 2008-9 年的房地产危机。我在 2008 年 5 月 NBER 会议上，就在一切陷入困境之前，记得当时有一次非常成功的

by Markus Brunnermeier that the market had, at that time, overreacted. Virtually all the esteemed audience found the presentation convincing (including me!). The logic was as follows. Global stock markets had fallend by $8Trillion, though it appeared housing seemed to have only extinguished $500B in value. Brad DeLong, with hindsight, even makes a

for a different narrative, but the logic is the same: no one understood the extent of the mortgage problem even after it was identified. The extent of the decline in underwriting, the legislative and regulatory reaction that lowered borrower's willingness to pay, was totally unappreciated. The base idea is that most experts didn't understand the crisis as it was happening, which is why things were as bad as they were. The things that hurt us are those things expert conventional wisdom does not see coming.

I would put default by the

，美国双重衰退和市政债违约等可能让很多人感到恐慌的情况。而通货膨胀大幅上升或美国利率的大幅提升，则是我认为大多数人会感到相当惊讶的事情，可能会造成更严重的损害。
