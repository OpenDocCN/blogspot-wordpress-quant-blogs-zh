# Quantifiable Edges: 6 Days Down & CBI Still 0

-   他注意到了 VIX 在这六天的抛售中表现出的温和反应。他注意到这是一个奇怪的情况，但并不是一个可以明确预测的情况。

-   我在此使用的恐惧度量标准是

[Quantifiable Edges Capitulative Breadth Indicator (CBI).](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/CBI)

The CBI looks for capitulative selling among S&P 100 stocks. During market pullbacks it is common to see the CBI rise. Very strong pullbacks will see higher readings, and as I have discussed many time before, readings of 10 or higher generally suggest a bounce is very near. But with the market down 6 days in a row the CBI is still at 0.

I looked back at other times the SPX closed down 6 days in a row. There have only been 3 of them, which is just another example of how odd recent market action has been. The other occurrences took place on 3/2/99, 8/1/11, and 11/23/11. With only 3 instances it would be dangerous to try and draw a conclusion about the meaning, but the instances couldn't be much different anyway. The '99 instance was quickly followed by solid gains. The 8/11 instance was followed by a massive selloff that only ended after the CBI did spike, and the 11/11 instance was immediately followed by a very sharp rally.

-   并非我所关注的一切都能预测，但这并不意味着它是无用的信息。虽然我所看到的大部分情况都预示着反弹，但了解这个设置有多么不寻常会警告你市场几乎可以做任何事情，CBI 的例子就证明了这一点。
