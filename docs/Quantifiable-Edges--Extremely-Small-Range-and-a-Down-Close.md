# Quantifiable Edges: Extremely Small Range and a Down Close

> 来源：[`quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/extremely-small-range-and-down-close.html#0001-01-01`](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/extremely-small-range-and-down-close.html#0001-01-01)

所以这里有一个东西是基于昨天的动作从时光机器里昨晚拿出来的：

This test suggests the setup has somewhat bearish implications. There are a few things to note here that aren’t evident in the above table. First, 24 of 29 instances (86%) saw the SPY close below its trigger day close at some point in the next 4 days. This is quite a high number. Interestingly, the last 2 times it has occurred, 4/7/09 and 5/5/09, it has led to swift rises and there was no lower close. That speaks to the power of the recent up move from the March lows.

下面是来自 Tradestaion 的股票图表，显示了使用简单 5 天持仓周期的结果。你可以看到在最后两次实例中发生的剧烈波动。
