# VIX and More: Is the Fear Bubble Bursting?

> 来源：[`vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/is-fear-bubble-bursting.html#0001-01-01`](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/is-fear-bubble-bursting.html#0001-01-01)

过去一年多的时间里，已经有很多泡沫和小型泡沫破灭了。一个简短的列表可能包括[中国](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China); 房地产; 石油; 化肥; [太阳能](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/solar%20stocks); 干散货运输船等。

What about a [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) bubble?

We have overshot on just about everything else, so maybe it’s time we overshot the whole business of overshooting. Fear and volatility have become so much a part of the everyday existence for those who work in the investment world that it is all too easy to take them for granted.

When I see a contract on [Intrade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade) that allows people to bet on the end of western civilization, then I’ll know things have gone too far. I haven’t seen such a contract yet, but I feel obliged to note that there is a contract for [The U.S. Economy to go into a Depression in 2009](http://www.intrade.com/jsp/intrade/common/c_cd.jsp?conDetailID=647817&z=1225236922807), with a depression defined as “a cumulative decline in [GDP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDP) of more than 10.0% over four consecutive quarters.”

观察过去的泡沫，我 wonder if the fear bubble is analogous to an oil bubble. You see macroeconomic events moving inexorably in the same direction day after day and you begin to assume the future is a predestined march down what looks like an unavoidable path.

在周一的[Fear Is on the Decline](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/fear-is-on-decline.html)一文中，我讨论了我所看到的迹象，表明恐惧已经开始“离开市场”。VIX 已经从周一下跌了超过 15%，而且有很大的机会，它将在至少另一个十年后再次看到 80 年代。

Roger Ehrenberg is out with another thoughtful piece, [Is Volatility Embedded in the System for a Generation?](http://www.informationarbitrage.com/2008/10/is-volatility-embedded-in-the-system-for-a-generation.html) In it, Roger paints a picture of a financial crisis receding only to the point that it exposes gaping fundamental holes in the economy, the substantial risk of a Japan-style deflation, and a Fed so determined to prevent deflation that their easy money policy leads to runaway inflation and ultimately some sort of cruel game of low growth inflation-deflation ping pong.

In such an environment, which I would not consider to be too far-fetched, Roger describes a VIX of 40 as the new 20 and predicts a much higher floor for volatility in the future.

另一方面，我想起了一篇我曾在 5 月 22 日发布的文章，标题为[VIX 的大问题](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/big-question-for-vix.html)，当时 VIX 收盘价为 18.05。在金融危机肆虐、油价接近 150 美元、投资者焦虑不断增加的情况下，当时的大问题是为什么 VIX 还在 20 以下。

就在五个月前，哪个场景更不可能发生：原油价格达到 60 美元还是波动率指数(VIX)达到 90？很难说，但足以说明在当时很难找到合适的期权行权价格来进行这样的投注。

在过去五个月里，因果关系已经颠倒。不久之前，是油价在推动未来经济活动和波动的预测，现在，经济是原因，而石油、波动性等成为了结果。

道琼斯工业平均指数一天上涨 900 点，并不能解决所有即将到来的经济问题。然而，这或许预示着恐慌市场的失控牛市即将结束。
