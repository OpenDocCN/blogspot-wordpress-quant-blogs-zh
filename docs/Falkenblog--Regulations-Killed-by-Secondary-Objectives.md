# Falkenblog: Regs Killed by Secondary Objectives

> 来源：[`falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/regulations-killed-by-secondary.html#0001-01-01`](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/regulations-killed-by-secondary.html#0001-01-01)

Avinash Persaud's mention that a bank tax related to the price of the 'price of risk', or Tyler Cowen's mention of better regulation of derivatives, or Joe Stiglitz's idea that the UN take over financial regulation, I think misses a very practical problem. That even when regulation has a good objective, it gets overloaded with other objectives. For example, we want to lower our energy dependence and lower carbon emmissions, and help US farmers! So we are building massive infrastructure for ethanol. When everyone figures out what a nightmare it is in terms of total costs, environmental costs, and the impracticality of this lousy alternative (low octane, not storable, corrosive), it will have to be written off on the taxpayer's dime.

I went to a baseball game Saturday night. Minneapolis's public transportation has several objectives, one of which is obviously to save on traffic and fuel. But there's also the hope that people will work, live, and spend more money in cities, which social planners think is great. So, they have 13 stops prior to getting downtown, hoping you stop along the way and spend money at the quaint, uh, strip malls, in the city. Further, you don't want to disrespect the vibrant city dwellers with express routes. So guess what: no one uses the train, because it stops every mile, and takes twice as long as driving. It's basically free ($1 for a round-trip downtown), and people only use it on big games. I could be very valuable, but given every major public action has multiple objectives, they take something that could be good, and make it worthless.

任何提出的规定都应该被期望成为一个负担，帮助解决贫困等不公平现象的根本原因，创造出比不做任何事情还糟糕的解决方案。就像乙醇作为我们能源问题的解决方案。
