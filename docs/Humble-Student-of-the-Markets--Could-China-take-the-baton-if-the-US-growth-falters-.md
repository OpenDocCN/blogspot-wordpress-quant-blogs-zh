# Humble Student of the Markets: Could China take the baton if the US growth falters?

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/08/could-china-take-baton-if-us-growth.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/08/could-china-take-baton-if-us-growth.html#0001-01-01)

**前言：解释我们的市场时机模型**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[构建终极市场时机模型](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading component of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

+   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*

+   Trend Model signal: Neutral*

+   Trading model: Bullish*

**如果我错了呢？**

Good investors always examine their assumptions. What if I am wrong? What are  the risks to my forecasts?

I had lunch with a friend where he pushed back on my bear case for a major market top (see

[重大市场顶部即将到来：我的内在投资者变得谨慎](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

以及

[在熊市中，股价能跌多远？](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/13/how-far-can-stock-prices-fall-in-a-bear-market/)

）。宏观经济情景大致如下：美联储正按计划每三个月稳步提高利率四分之一点。如果年底前没有其他情况，货币供应增长和收益率曲线等货币指标将显示出衰退信号。美国经济轻微衰退，中国因为过度杠杆而遭遇重创，从感冒演变成硬着陆。全球传染导致全球同步衰退，其规模可能与上次金融危机一样严重。

目前，全球经济前景已经岌岌可危。随着所有人纷纷涌入，美国股票似乎成了镇上唯一的游戏。

当然，美国是最后剩下的增长源泉。LPL Financial 发现，尽管美国盈利预期仍在上升，但非美国发达市场（EAFE）的预期是持平的，新兴市场的预期则在下降。的确，美国正在引领世界，但如果美国经济增长放缓，那会发生什么呢？

我午餐伙伴对看跌情景的主要反对意见是中国联系。目前尚不清楚，美国消费者的减缓是否会触发中国显著的经济放缓。即使中国经济增长放缓，北京仍有大量政策杠杆来缓冲经济下行。这是一个重要问题。中国仍然是全球增长的大摇摆因素。如果中国没有崩溃呢？与我的看跌情景相比，下行风险将会非常轻微。

如果美国经济增长乏力，中国能接过接力棒吗？
