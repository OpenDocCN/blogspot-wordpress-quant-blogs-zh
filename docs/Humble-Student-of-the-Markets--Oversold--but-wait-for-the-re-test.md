# Humble Student of the Markets: Oversold, but wait for the re-test

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/02/oversold-but-wait-for-re-test.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/02/oversold-but-wait-for-re-test.html#0001-01-01)

**中期市场更新**：兹威格 Breadth Thrust 买入信号是一种罕见的股价动量信号，自兹威格在其概述该信号的书中撰写以来，仅触发过六次。在买入信号之后的 12 个月内，股市每次都上涨。它需要兹威格 Breadth Thrust 指标（ZBT）在 10 个交易日内从超卖恢复到超买状态，这确实是一种罕见的情况。

While the ZBT buy signal is extremely rare, the ZBT Indicator can serve as a useful short-term trading indicator when it is oversold. In the past, this has served to indicate favorable risk-reward long entry points, which seems to be the situation today.
