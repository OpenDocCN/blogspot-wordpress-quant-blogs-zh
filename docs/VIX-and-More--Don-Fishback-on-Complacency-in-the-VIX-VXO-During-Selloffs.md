# VIX 和更多：Don Fishback 在市场下跌期间关于 VIX/VXO 的 complacency

> 来源：[`vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/don-fishback-on-complacency-in-vixvxo.html#0001-01-01`](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/don-fishback-on-complacency-in-vixvxo.html#0001-01-01)

When someone follows the

[VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)

more closely than the VIX, it is usually because they have been doing it for a decade or more and found no reason to switch when the

2003 年。从实际意义上讲，VIX 和 VXO 之间的差异对于大多数投资者来说并不足够重要，不值得同时监测这两个波动指数。

With that preamble out of the way, I am pleased to report on some interesting research on the VXO by

[Don Fishback](https://www.donfishback.com/)

, who is indeed an experienced hand when it comes to options and volatility. Looking at instances going back to 1986 in which the OEX (the S&P 100 index, which is the underlying for the VXO) declined 10% and the VXO remained under 30, Fishback concludes:

*“Bottom line is that when the market falls 10% off of a recent high, and VXO stays below 30%, what was bad gets worse. In every prior instance where VXO failed to climb to above 30%, the market continued lower. The MINIMUM additional downside is another 10%.”*

Granted, these conclusions cover only six data points that fit the statistical profile noted above, but the correlation between the level of the VXO when the 10% OEX decline is met and the extent of the subsequent decline over all 14 data points in the study is also worth pondering.

When it comes to

a signs of a market bottom, my thinking is remains that while we don’t need a

to signal capitulation, the higher the VIX spike, the higher the odds that a bottom will hold. See January’s
