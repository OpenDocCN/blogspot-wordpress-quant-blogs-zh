# VIX and More: The VIX, Rule of 16 and Realized Volatility

> 来源：[`vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/vix-rule-of-16-and-realized-volatility.html#0001-01-01`](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/vix-rule-of-16-and-realized-volatility.html#0001-01-01)

两天前，在[16 规则与 40 的 VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/rule-of-16-and-vix-of-40.html)中，我讨论了[16 规则](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rule%20of%2016)如何把（年化的）VIX 数字转化为对未来 S&P 500 指数每日[实际波动性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)的预期。

那篇帖子引起了几条有趣的评论，不幸的是，它们现在不知怎的寄存在[Disqus](http://disqus.com/)的某种中间状态中。在评论中，rafaminos 提出了以下的观点：

> *It seems that VIX is on average higher that realized volatility (based on daily returns over 30 days). I also tried to shift VIX 30 days in advance and the conclusion is the same. Since the historical ratio of the two is 1.45 (VIX/realized volatility), should not we infer from this past relationship that the implied realized volatility is more like 30 (45/1.45), meaning a 2% change 1/3 of the time?*

我的回复似乎也在评论的炼狱中，但我的回应的核心如下：

> *Over that last 20 years, I get a VIX that is about 1.40 times the SPX 20-day realized volatility. I attribute some of the discrepancy to the high demand for SPX puts as hedges, which tends to inflate the VIX relative to realized volatility (and immediately suggests some strategic implications vis-a-vis short SPX puts strategies.)

> 所以……鉴于 VIX 为 32 大约是 SPX 实际波动性的 1.4 倍，以及 32/1.4=22.9 和 32*1.4=44.8，根据历史证据，我会得出以下结论：
> 
> **1) VIX of 32** – 1/3 of the time the SPX is expected to have a daily change of at least 2%, but...*

> ***2a) VIX of 32** – 1/3 of the time the SPX will (based on historical data) have a daily change of at least 1.4%
> 
> **2b) VIX of 45** – 1/3 of the time the SPX will (based on historical data) have a daily change of at least 2%*
