# Falkenblog: Moody's Glitch Transposes A2 to Aaa

> 来源：[`falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moodys-glitch-transposes-a2-to-aaa.html#0001-01-01`](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moodys-glitch-transposes-a2-to-aaa.html#0001-01-01)

Well, one response by Moody's could be, how many of you guys know what A2 means anyway? Is it better, or worse, than A1? Aaa? When John Moody left S&P to start his own firm, he had to create a new scale, so S&P kept the more intuitive AAA, AA+ scale while Moody came up with his wicked nomenclature.

Anyway, the stock

today because Moody's

[admitted](http://dailybriefing.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/05/21/computer-bug-bites-moodys/)

that a AAA security should have been 'several notches' lower but for a problem in their computer code. 'Several' means 'more than 3, but not many'. Let's say 5\. So five notches lower is A2\. Nice, as Borat would say.

The problem was with

, instruments so complex Fitch wouldn't even rate them. An analyst at CreditSights in April 2006 noted that "though we cannot pinpoint exactly where the flaw in the ratings methodology is, there are a number of things to give us unease". [I should note that these things are infinitely less complicated than

].

As mentioned in my post on

[why bank examiners should have access to pnl](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/bank-examiners-need-to-see-detailed-pnl.html)

by line of business, a simple sniff test should have exposed this instantly. Even in 2005, these things had AAA ratings but 200 basis point spreads to Treasuries, while regular AAA debt had only a 20 basis point spread. Great opportunity, you might ask? Well, no. Moody's rates things based on an expected loss methodology. It puts collateral through scenarios, and notes the various trigger points that cause structures to collapse, in calculating the expected loss of various senior notes from these pools of collateral. That is, the expected loss on a AAA rated note on a pool of B rated credit is highly nonlinear, accounting for the fact that AAA pieces often have zero losses until several barriers are breached.

But Moody's is consistent, and so, the expected loss on these AAA rated senior pieces should be the same as the expected losses on all AAA rated debt, if they ran their models correctly. Now, one can imagine the market, due to illiquidity, might give these things a 20 or 40 basis point premium, but 200? That's the market saying 'your models are wrong', which was, in effect, the absence of S&P and Fitch also said.

Agency ratings are best thought of in natural log scale, so that the natural log of the average default rates is

about

1.5 个单位与 AAA 到 B 的 'grade' 相差（0.01%，0.04%，0.13%，0.36%，1.1%，4.9%）。所以差几个刻度是很重要的，因为它从'刻度'变成了'等级'，这在直觉上是可以辨别的。

关键是，你怎么能相信你不理解的东西呢？一个简单的方法就是不去相信。但这会让人相当呆滞。我们每天都依赖一些我们不理解的东西，比如飞机是怎么飞的，我的处方药是怎么起作用的，甚至我的脑袋是怎么告诉我做某件事的。所以，我们很依赖品牌名称和它们代表的诚实和彻底的声誉。因此，像这样的一个打击对穆迪来说应该是非常昂贵的，但这表明解决方案是内生的，因为穆迪有自我纠正这个错误的利益。

与此同时，在评估风险时也要看看回报。如果它们似乎与其他看似类似风险的回报不成比例，
