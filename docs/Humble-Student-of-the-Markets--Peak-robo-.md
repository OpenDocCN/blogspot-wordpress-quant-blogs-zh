# Humble Student of the Markets: Peak robo?

> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/10/peak-robo.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/10/peak-robo.html#0001-01-01)

We all know about how the business model of robo-advisor works. First, determine the appropriate asset mix based on the risk, return, tax regime and other specific needs of the client. Then, build the portfolio and rebalance it on a periodic basis. The typical investment process can be summarized by the following steps:

1.  Determine the target asset mix, which could change depending on market conditions.

1.  Re-balance if:

+   资产配置权重变化超过一定百分比，例如 10%，从目标权重变化；或者

+   Periodically, such on an annual basis These are all sensible rules that have long been practiced in the investment industry. In essence, the strategy involves taking profits on winning asset classes and averaging down on losers as a form of risk-control discipline

By following these simple rules, a portfolio will get investing decisions similar to what is depicted in the chart below. The top panel shows the price chart of the Dow Jones Global Index and the bottom panel shows the relative price performance of DJ Global against US Treasuries. Depending on the exact rebalancing rules, a fixed-weight portfolio that re-balances periodically will buy stocks near the bottom of the market and sell them near the top.

虽然机器人顾问的基本商业模式没有改变，但我可以看到对于独立的机器人模型的几个竞争威胁。事实上，这些威胁可能预示着独立机器人顾问的顶峰。
