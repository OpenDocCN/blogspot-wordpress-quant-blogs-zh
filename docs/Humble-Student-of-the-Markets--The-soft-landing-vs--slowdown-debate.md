> 来源：[`humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-soft-landing-vs-slowdown-debate.html#0001-01-01`](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-soft-landing-vs-slowdown-debate.html#0001-01-01)

**前言：解释我们的市场时机模型**

我们维护着几个市场时机模型，每个模型都有不同的时间范围。"

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[构建终极市场时机模型](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**趋势资产配置模型**

is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

My inner trader uses a

**交易模型**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

+   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities (Last changed from “buy” on 26-Mar-2023)*

+   Trend Model signal: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 17-Mar-2023)*

+   交易模型：中性（最后从“看跌”变为于 2023 年 6 月 15 日）*

#### A fragile consensus

共识故事的转变速度之快令人瞩目。两周前，当 ADP 非农就业报告以惊人的 497K 发布时，两年期国债收益率一度超过 5%，远超预期的 228K。这一消息促使人们猜测，美联储将不得不比预期更多地收紧政策，并将经济推入衰退。

上周，比预期更为温和的 CPI 报告突然改变了市场的共识，转为软着陆，并引发了风险资产的上涨和收益率的下降。这很重要，因为两年期国债收益率是市场对联邦基金利率预期的代理。两年期利率过去的峰值要么是巧合，要么导致了联邦基金利率的峰值。

当前环境展示了市场共识的脆弱性质。如果叙事可以从熊市转为牛市只需一周，那么它可能很容易再次反转。市场正处于一个关键的转折点。软着陆团队正在与放缓团队进行一场激烈的较量。谁会赢？
