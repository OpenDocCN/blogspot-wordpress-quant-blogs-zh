# Quick Take: 市场（RSM）长期历史相对强度概述 | CSSA

*Note: Quick Takes will be short articles introducing new ideas or concepts that haven’t been tested. It is designed to help inspire your own personal systems. If you wish to demonstrate the results of Quick Takes ideas, your results will be published on this site subject to verification.*

The first priority in system design is to find a strategy that works consistently over time. The second and often overlooked priority in my opinion should be in market selection. Now this is a topic that is very broad and covers such factors as liquidity and contract sizes as well as how well the personality of the specific market matches your own personality. While these subjects are certainly very important, what i am referring to for the purposes of this article is to select the market(s) that is(are) likely to be the most profitable for your system. For example, using the Donchian Channel strategy mentioned in the previous post, after analyzing the profitability by market I noticed that some markets are consistently more profitable than others. Notable examples are currencies and petro-commodities (oil, heating oil and gas). For mean-reversion based strategies using indicators like the DV2, the best markets include the  S&P500 and the real estate sector index (IYR).

The million dollar question is: ” how do we identify these markets beforehand?” Well the answer is to simply create a rolling historical analysis of the profitability across different market and incorporate that into your strategy. What I am talking about is essentially taking a look at the relative strength of the equity curves for various markets and adjusting with proper frequency. How do we do this? Here are two initial rules:

1) If you are using a short-term strategy such as the DV2, RSI2, or a short-term moving average, than you should take a look at a 1-3 year  historical relative strength by market using a risk-adjusted measure such as the DVR or the Sharpe Ratio. Every 2-3 months you should re-evaluate the historical relative strength by market. Select the top 2 or 3 markets based on their performance using the strategy.

-   如果你使用的是像唐奇安通道、RSI 14 或者长期移动平均线这样的长期策略，那么你应该查看一个使用风险调整指标（如 DVR 或夏普比率）的 10-15 年的市场历史相对强度。你每年都应该重新评估一次市场的历史相对强度。基于策略表现，选择表现最好的 2 或 3 个市场。

根据我的观察，某些市场似乎总是表现出趋势性或均值回归的行为。举个例子，在 10 多年前，当我首次研究趋势追踪策略时，当时表现最好的（涵盖各种策略）市场几乎与最近 10 年的市场完全相同。在我们对股市更详细的研究中，某些股票和板块使用基于动量的策略表现出了显著的持续性。几乎 35 年来，科技板块对这些类型的策略做出了惊人的反应。快进到 2009 年，科技板块是最近市场反弹中表现最好的主要指数。当然，市场是会变化的，但这与使用历史相对强度策略无关。设计系统时的首要任务是创建一个稳健且能适应当前环境中有效方法的模型。例如， knowing that the current environment favors mean reversion strategies 我们会选择 DV2 作为我们最喜欢的指标。既然你已经做到了这一点，现在你会看看它在哪些市场上表现最好，然后自然而然地选择标普 500、日本指数（EWJ）或房地产板块（IYR）。如果你想要交易中短期内移动平均线（这仍然有效），你肯定会选择纳斯达克、罗素 2000 和商品指数（GSG 或 DBC）。

对于那些勤奋的读者，如果你希望以一种结构化的方式测试这一点，我将很乐意呈现你的结果。
