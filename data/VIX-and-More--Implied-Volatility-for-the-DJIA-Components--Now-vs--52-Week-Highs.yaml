    I can imagine there will be very few celebratory parties.

- en: I certainly have no desire to celebrate what turned out to be my second experience
    jumping out of an airplane, but I do want to make sure that some of the volatility
    data from that period are captured here for posterity. At some point in the future,
    some of us will want to look back and see just how crazy things got in during
    the historic volatility of October and November.

  zh: 我当然没有庆祝我第二次跳伞的经验，但我确实想确保在那段时间的一些波动数据在这里为后世保存。在未来的某个时刻，我们中的某些人将想要回顾并看看在10月和11月的历史波动期间事情变得多么疯狂。
- en: With this idea in mind, I have chosen to make this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    a reflection on the current [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    vs. the 52 week high IV of the 30 companies which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
    Average. Of course the DJIA consists of some of the most financially sound companies
    in the world, so this exercise should highlight companies experienced a less severe
    impact due to the financial crisis than some of their more speculative peers.
    In fact, the numbers show that peak implied volatility for these blue chips was,
    on average, about 3.2 times higher than it is now. Even now, some of these numbers
    boggle the mind and make a VIX of 89.53 look almost pedestrian in comparison.

  zh: 带着这样的想法，我选择让这周的[图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)反映出当前[隐含波动率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)与道琼斯工业平均指数30家成分公司的52周高点隐含波动率的对比。当然，道琼斯工业平均指数由世界上一些最稳健的公司组成，因此这个练习应该突出一些公司因金融危机的影响比他们的某些投机性同行更为轻微。事实上，这些蓝筹股的峰值隐含波动率平均比现在高出约3.2倍。即使现在，其中的一些数字也令人震惊，使得89.53的VIX看起来几乎平淡无奇。
- en: Note that Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)) and
    [AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG) were part of the DJIA when
    Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and subsequently had their membership from that
    select club revoked. For comparison purposes, consider that Citigroup’s implied
    volatility peaked at over 328 and currently sits at 66\. AIG, on the other hand,
    saw its implied volatility spike all the way up to 540\. It has since fallen to
    a more benign, but considerably elevated 135\. Progress? Perhaps…

  zh: 请注意，当雷曼兄弟破产时，花旗集团（[C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)）和[AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG)是道琼斯工业平均指数的组成部分，随后它们从这个精选俱乐部的会员资格被取消。为了进行比较，考虑花旗集团的隐含波动率最高达到328以上，目前为66。另一方面，AIG的隐含波动率一度激增至540。自那时以来，它已经下降到更加温和但相当
    elevated 135。进步？也许…
