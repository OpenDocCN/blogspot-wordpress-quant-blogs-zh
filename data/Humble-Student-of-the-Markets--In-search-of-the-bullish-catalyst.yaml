- en: I have pointed out before that the last time the 10-year Treasury yield was
    at these levels, the S&P 500 was trading at a forward P/E of 14-16\. The current
    forward P/E is 16.8, which is slightly above that range. In order for stock prices
    to rise, at least one of two things has to happen. Either the discount rate has
    to fall, which expands P/E ratios, or earnings have to rise.

  zh: 我之前已经指出，上次10年期国债收益率达到这些水平时，标普500的预期市盈率（P/E）在14-16之间。目前的预期市盈率是16.8，略高于这个范围。为了股价上涨，至少要发生两件事之一。要么折现率下降，从而扩大市盈率，要么盈利上升。

    of falling rates is off the table. In that case, what's the outlook for earnings?
