- en: If the standard asset pricing model is correct, we estimate expected returns
    from risk premiums and their factor loadings (eg, beta*equity return premium),
    and we can infer the risk loadings and risk premiums from an expected return.
    Given we don't observe expected returns, but assume that with large samples, average
    returns estimate expected returns, this is why the small cap risk factor is supposed
    to exist, because it tautologically explains the higher return to small cap stocks
    over large cap stocks. In this way there should be a risk-return duality from
    expected return to risk.

  zh: 如果标准资产定价模型是正确的，我们从风险溢价和它们的因子载荷（例如，beta*股票回报溢价）估计预期回报，并且我们可以从预期回报推断风险载荷和风险溢价。假设我们不观察预期回报，但假定大样本时，平均回报可以估计预期回报，这就是小市值风险因子被认为存在的原因，因为它从逻辑上解释了小市值股票相比大市值股票的更高回报。这样，从预期回报到风险应该存在风险-回报二重性。

    without assuming a large amount of risk, merely because it necessarily follows

    The conditional volatility on an asset where a relatively large return is significantly
    probable must be larger than for an asset where a relatively large return is less

    invest based on the delusion that their expected returns are single outcomes,
    they are constantly evaluating value. Many investors are making this work, investing
    by applying some discounted cash flow logic. They are sufficiently right that
    a stock price is a decent estimate of its future profitability, but sufficiently
    wrong so that the stocks with the greatest expected variances, which necessarily
    include those stocks with the greatest expected returns among its investors, tend
    to be most 'over-bought', and thus have the lowest returns. Expected returns,
    derived from a model that empirically estimates expected returns from historical
    returns, as opposed to canvassing investor opinion, are negatively related to
    risk. Low volatility investing is truly outside-the-box, an expectation that comes
    from noting the emergent pattern caused by investor beliefs, which contain a systematic
