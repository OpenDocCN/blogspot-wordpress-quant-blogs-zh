    on Lehman's books, it is too early to say anything really smart about the Lehman
    meltdown. Hopefully, they will have something like UBS's report to shareholders,
    that went over very precisely what went wrong. That is, what kinds of Asset Backed
    Securities, or credit default swaps, were on their books? One needs to know not
    just the 30,000 feet level, but the actual type, their subordination. I haven't
    seen any of that. I suspect they had assets that, marked to comparable securities,
    made them insolvent. But back in 1980, most of the financial system was insolvent,
    but back then very little of their balance sheet was marked to market, so they
    lived through the high interest rates. I imagine back in 1970, it was similar,
    but with the 'banking book' not being marked to market, only insiders from back
    then know.

  zh: 我认为在获得了雷曼兄弟账面上有什么资产的全面披露之前，要说有关雷曼破产的任何聪明话还为时过早。希望他们会像瑞银那样向股东发布报告，非常精确地总结出错在哪里。也就是说，什么样的资产支持证券，或信贷违约掉期，存在他们的账面上？人们需要知道的不仅是整体情况，还有实际类型，它们的优先级。我什么都没看到。我怀疑他们的资产，按照可比证券的估值，使他们资不抵债。但早在1980年，大部分金融体系就已资不抵债，但当时很少有他们的资产负债表按市场价值计算，所以他们挨过了高利率时期。我想1970年前后也是类似情况，但是，他们的“银行账簿”没有按市场价值计算，只有当时的内部人员才知道。
- en: It's an interesting issue, because as we see with closed end funds, the market
    value can diverge from net asset value. I'm not clear that this Lehman bankruptcy
    was necessary or appropriate, but I don't have much information. I'm doing some
    bottom up work on mortgages now, and can tell you that figuring out their valuation
    is very difficult.

  zh: 这是一个有意思的问题，因为我们可以从封闭式基金中发现，市场价值可能会偏离净资产价值。我不清楚雷曼兄弟的破产是否是必要的或适当的，但我没有太多信息。我现在正在做一些关于抵押贷款的底部工作，可以告诉你找出它们的估值是非常困难的。

    that more regulation would have mitigated this. The government, and the regulators,
    were behind this ''ownership society'' push. I think its implausible to think
    that more resources would have changed that focus. They might have made it worse.'

  zh: ，他自信地断言更多监管就是答案，但没有任何证据显示更多监管会缓解这一情况。政府和监管者是在推动这种“所有权社会”。我认为认为增加资源将改变这一焦点是不切实际的。他们可能会使情况更糟糕。
