    captured many of the high points on the blog during the past year, I also believe
    it might be interesting for readers to hear about which posts were some of my
    favorites.

  zh: 虽然我认为[2009 年度热门帖子](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/top-posts-of-2009.html)捕捉了博客在过去一年中的许多亮点，但我也相信对读者来说了解哪些帖子是我最喜欢的可能会很有趣。
- en: Looking back at everything I wrote in 2009, I suspect that my most important
    work was probably with [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN. I believe I was the first to analyze
    VXX in any detail, discuss some of the shortcomings and ultimately tie it all
    together in [Why the VXX Is Not a Good Short-Term or Long-Term Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-vxx-is-not-good-short-term-or-long.html).
    Along the way, I think [VXX Calculations, VIX Futures and Time Decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/vxx-calculations-vix-futures-and-time.html)
    was the piece that shaped the thinking of many investors. In terms of timeliness,
    [VXX Juice Factor and Portfolio Insurance Implications](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-juice-factor-and-portfolio.html)
    was a warning shot I fired in the first month after VXX was launched.

  zh: 回顾我在 2009 年写的一切，我怀疑我的最重要的工作可能是与[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)有关，即
    iPath 标普 500 VIX 短期期货交易所交易基金。我相信我是第一个对 VXX 进行详细分析，并讨论一些缺点，并最终在[为什么 VXX 不是一个好的短期或长期投资](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-vxx-is-not-good-short-term-or-long.html)中把一切都联系在一起的人。在这个过程中，我认为[VXX
    计算、VIX 期货和时间衰减](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/vxx-calculations-vix-futures-and-time.html)是塑造了许多投资者思维的重要文章。在及时性方面，[VXX
    的收益率因子和投资组合保险影响](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-juice-factor-and-portfolio.html)是我在
    VXX 推出后的第一个月发出的一次警告。
- en: While volatility declined almost in a straight line for the entire year, stocks
    did not. In retrospect, [The Possibility of a ‘Stealth Bottom’](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/possibility-of-stealth-bottom.html)
    was one of my best predictions and my March 5^(th) [SPX at 687; Intermediate Bottom
    Potential Is High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)

  zh: 尽管波动性在整个年份几乎是一条直线下降的，但股票并非如此。回顾过去，[“潜在底部”的可能性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/possibility-of-stealth-bottom.html)是我最好的预测之一，而我在
    3 月 5 日的[SPX at 687; Intermediate Bottom Potential Is High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)只早了一天。
- en: Some of my favorite posts of the year were related to how to think about trading.
    The [Trader Development Stage Model – Version 2.0](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/trader-stage-development-model-version.html)
    was a way for me to articulate some of my thinking on the subject of how traders
    evolve. In [The Trader Development Stage Model and the Jump from Stocks to Options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/trader-stage-development-model-and-jump.html)
    I liked how the model explained how and why new options traders get into trouble.
    A precursor to the model was a pair of posts [Kafka, Surrealism and Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/kafka-surrealism-and-trading.html)
    and [Comfort Zones, Focus and Thinking Like a Biotech Firm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/comfort-zones-focus-and-thinking-like.html)
    which address trading strategy development. Earlier in the year, [Can Options
    Selling Make You a Better Trader?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html)
    probably got the wheels turning about some of the elements of superior trading
    performance.

  zh: 本年度我最喜欢的一些帖子与交易思维有关。[交易员发展阶段模型-2.0版](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/trader-stage-development-model-version.html)是我阐述一些关于交易员成长的思考的方式。在[交易员发展阶段模型和从股票跳到期权的过渡](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/trader-stage-development-model-and-jump.html)中，我喜欢这个模型解释了新期权交易员如何以及为什么陷入麻烦的原因。该模型的前身是一对帖子[卡夫卡、超现实主义和交易](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/kafka-surrealism-and-trading.html)和[舒适区、专注力和像生物技术公司一样思考](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/comfort-zones-focus-and-thinking-like.html)，这两篇文章涉及交易策略的发展。今年早些时候，[卖出期权能让你成为更好的交易员吗？](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html)也许引发了对优秀交易表现的一些元素的思考。
- en: In another impromptu series of posts, I dipped my toe into behavioral finance
    in [Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html).
    The ideas from that post became much more compelling when I tied them back to
    the VIX in [The VIX:VXV Ratio, Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vixvxv-ratio-availability-bias-and.html)
    and later in [VIX Data to Support Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting Hypothesis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-data-to-support-availability-bias.html).

  zh: 在另一系列即兴帖子中，我初次涉足行为金融领域，在[可获得性偏见和灾难印记](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html)中提出的观点，当我把它们与VIX联系起来时变得更加引人注目，在[VIX：VXV比率、可获得性偏见和灾难印记](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vixvxv-ratio-availability-bias-and.html)以及稍后的[VIX数据支持可获得性偏见和灾难印记假设](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-data-to-support-availability-bias.html)。
- en: 'It turns out that the behavioral finance posts and several posts on realized
    volatility shared some analytical ideas. In [The Gap Between the VIX and Realized
    Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)
    I posted my what I believe is my first graphical representation of the difference
    between the VIX and realized volatility. When that extended gap finally came to
    an end, I posted about it in [Chart of the Week: No More Free Lunch for Volatility
    Sellers?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-no-more-free-lunch-for.html)'

  zh: 结果发现，行为金融帖子和关于实现波动性的几篇帖子分享了一些分析思路。在[波动率指数（VIX）与实现波动性之间的差距](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)中，我发布了我认为是我第一个图形表示VIX和实现波动性之间差异的图表。当那个扩大的差距最终结束时，我在[本周图表：对波动性卖家来说没有免费午餐？](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-no-more-free-lunch-for.html)中发表了关于它的文章。
- en: With other voices now regularly discussing the VIX, I don’t feel the need to
    post on that subject as much as I once did, but my incredulity recently boiled
    over in [The VIX Spike Conundrum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html)
    after I saw many pundits essentially suggesting that investors panic along with
    the crowd.

  zh: 现在有其他声音定期讨论VIX，我不再像以前那样觉得有必要经常发布关于这个主题的帖子了，但是最近我对[VIX尖峰难题](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html)感到难以置信，因为我看到很多专家基本上建议投资者跟随人群恐慌。
- en: Last but not least, two of my favorite humorous interludes were [Roubini and
    the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/roubini-and-vix.html) and [Blogging

- en: On a personal note, I am delighted to say than in many instances it was reader
    comments and private emails which provided the inspiration and kicked started
    a dialogue of ideas that eventually resulted in some of these posts. I continue
    to be surprised by the extent to which blogging is a collaborative process and
    am thankful to all who have made my life richer in 2009 by sharing their questions
    and insights.

  zh: 在个人层面上，我非常高兴地说，在许多情况下，正是读者的评论和私人邮件提供了灵感，启动了一场关于想法的对话，最终导致了这些帖子中的一些内容。我对博客是一个协作过程的程度感到惊讶，并且感谢所有在2009年通过分享问题和见解使我的生活更加丰富的人。
