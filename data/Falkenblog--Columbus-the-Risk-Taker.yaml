- en: Columbus know that the world was round, but he...thought that the diameter of
    the world was only three quarters as big as it really is. He also overestimated
    the eastward and distance to Asia and therefore by subtraction grossly underestimated
    the westward water distance to Asia...Given the amount of water put on board,
    without the Americas Columbus and all his men would have died of thirst and been
    unknown in our history books. Columbus goes down in history as the world's greatest
    explorer...because he found the completely unexpected, the Americas, and they
    happened to be full of gold. One moral of the story is that it is important to
    be smart, but that it is even more important to be lucky. But ultimately Columbus
    did not succeed because he was lucky. He succeeded because he made the effort
    to set sail in a direction never before taken despite a lot of resistance from
    those around him. Without that enormous effort he could not have been in the position
    to have a colossal piece of good luck.

  zh: 哥伦布知道世界是圆的，但他...认为世界的直径只有实际大小的四分之三。他还高估了通往亚洲的东方距离，因此通过减法严重低估了通往亚洲的西方水路距离...考虑到船上的水量，没有美洲大陆，哥伦布和他所有的人都会因口渴而死，并且在我们的历史书中无名。哥伦布被载入史册成为世界上最伟大的探险家...因为他发现了完全意想不到的美洲，而且它们碰巧充满了黄金。这个故事的一个道德是聪明很重要，但更重要的是幸运。但最终，哥伦布之所以成功并不是因为他幸运。他成功是因为他努力朝着前所未有的方向航行，尽管周围的人反对他很多。如果没有那巨大的努力，他就不可能处于有巨大好运的位置。
- en: As Orson Wells noted, "What is confidence? Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance
    – you know there’s no confidence to equal it. It’s only when you know something
    about a profession, I think, that you’re timid or careful."

  zh: 正如奥森·威尔斯所说：“信心是什么？无知，无知，纯粹的无知——你知道没有什么信心能比得上。只有当你对某个职业有所了解时，我想，你才会胆怯或谨慎。”
- en: A little delusional overconfidence is surely a good thing, but this is rather
    paradoxical because most rational people like Robin Hanson preach that knowing
    The Truth is most important, and one should always be adjusting one's opinions
    in light of our known propensity to be overconfident (eg, most of us think we
    are better than average in wit, common sense, our wisdom in politics, etc.). Too
    much rationality can make one not take chances, because while any business plan
    is often predicated on a false assumption, they often put one in a situation to
    succeed. I think the take away is to remember that getting into something plausible
    that are very good at, will present a lots of unknown option value, so don't be
    too demanding.

  zh: 一点点妄自尊大的自信无疑是一件好事，但这是相当矛盾的，因为大多数理性的人，比如罗宾·汉森，宣扬了知道真相最重要，一个人应该根据我们已知的自大倾向调整自己的观点（例如，我们大多数人认为自己在智慧、常识、政治智慧等方面都比平均水平更好）。过多的理性可能会让人不敢冒险，因为尽管任何商业计划通常都是基于错误的假设，但它们通常会让人处于成功的境地。我认为要记住的是，参与某些我们擅长的东西很有可能会带来许多未知的选择价值，所以不要太苛求。
- en: 'Columbus also had a lot of relevant experience as an alpha producer negotiating
    with his capital provider. Note that portfolio managers can receive anything from
    a flat salary, to 50% cut of the profit, to equity ownership. It all depends on
    one''s negotiating power, because if your story is credible, and there is alpha
    there, this is a free lunch and so investors should be happy to get only 50%.
    But of course this is all speculative, and often the man with the plan has few
    rich relatives. Columbus boldly asked for the following conditional upon being
    successful: he was to be knighted, appointed Grand Admiral and Viceroy (king''s
    representative) of all the lands he discovered, and he would keep a tenth of all
    taxes levied there. Spain initially refused, so he went to France, and so Spain
    acceded his demands, and gave him two old ships (Columbus rented a third himself).
    In the end, his greed cost him, as his wild imaginings made him so unpopular that
    he king had his own viceroy and admiral arrested and brought home from the West
    Indies in chains. I suppose that all descendants of Columbus might file suit,
    asking for one-tenth of all American tax receipts.'

  zh: 哥伦布也有大量相关经验，作为一个α产出者与他的资本提供者进行谈判。请注意，投资组合经理可以获得从固定工资到利润的50%分成再到股权所有权的任何东西。这一切取决于一个人的谈判能力，因为如果你的故事可信，并且有α，这就是一顿免费的午餐，所以投资者应该很高兴只得到50%。但当然这一切都是推测，并且经常有计划的人家里有几个富有的亲戚。哥伦布大胆地要求以下条件才能成功：他将被封为骑士，任命为大上将和所有他发现的土地的副王（国王代表），并且他将保留所有征税的十分之一。西班牙最初拒绝了，所以他去了法国，于是西班牙同意了他的要求，并给了他两艘旧船（哥伦布自己租了第三艘）。最后，他的贪婪使他付出了代价，因为他的狂妄想象使他如此不受欢迎，以至于国王让他的副王和上将被带回西印度群岛，被带着镣铐带回家。我想哥伦布的所有后代都可能会提起诉讼，要求所有美国税收的十分之一。
