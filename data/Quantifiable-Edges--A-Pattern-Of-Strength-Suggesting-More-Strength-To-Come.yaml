- en: Short-term strength is often followed by short-term weakness, but when that
    short-term strength is unusually impressive, it can create a situation where that
    extreme strength will beget more strength. When the market leaves an unfilled
    up gap that is considered a sign of strength.  When it does it 2 days in a row
    and closes at a 50-day high, that can be considered exceptional strength. That
    is what happened on Friday, and past performance is shown in the study below.

  zh: 短期强势往往随后是短期弱势，但当这种短期强势格外显著时，它就能创造一种极端强势会带来更多强势的局面。当市场留下一个未填补的上升缺口，这被认为是强势的迹象。当它连续两天这样做并且收盘于50日均线高点，那可以被认为是超常强势。上周五就是这样，过去的业绩在下面的研究中展示。

    consistent that at least some follow through was achieved in the next few days.

  zh: 后续走势的规模并不特别大。但是一直以来都非常一致的是，在接下来的几天里至少会有一些后续走势实现。
