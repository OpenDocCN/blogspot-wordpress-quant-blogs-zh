- en: On Sunday evening, Paulson announced a proposal by Treasury to have Congress
    raise the $2.25 billion it is allowed to loan the two firms, and even open the
    door for the federal government to buy shares in the two companies if needed.
    The Fed announced it stood ready to loan money to the firms if they needed access
    to funds ahead of congressional actions.

  zh: 上周日晚上，保尔森宣布了财政部的提议，要求国会批准提高向这两家公司贷款的上限，金额为 225 亿美元，并且即使要的话，联邦政府还可以开放大门，购买这两家公司的股票。美联储宣布，如果这两家公司需要在国会采取行动之前获得资金，它将准备好向这些公司贷款。
- en: Today in congress, Bunning, a longtime critic of Fannie and Freddie, said ``The
    taxpayers have reacted and the market has reacted to your plan by driving down
    Fannie Mae shares 26 percent today, right now,Freddie Mac's are down 29 percent
    at this moment, just in case you are interested in how the markets are reacting
    to your wonderful plan.''

  zh: '今天在国会，长期批评芬妮和弗雷迪的邦宁表示：“纳税人和市场对你们的计划的反应是推动芬尼·梅股票下跌了26%，现在，弗雷迪马克的股价也下跌了29%，就在此刻，如果你们对市场的反应感兴趣的话。” '
- en: Then Paulson said, though he wanted the guarantees, but he did not expect to
    use them. Bunning then said "There's a lot of us who would like to believe what
    you're saying, But we're skeptical. Anytime we approve something, it gets used."

  zh: 然后保尔森说，尽管他想要这些担保，但他不指望会使用它们。邦宁接着说：“我们中有很多人希望相信你说的话，但我们是持怀疑态度的。每当我们批准了某事，它就会被使用。”
- en: 'Now this is very interesting, because I can sympathize with both positions.
    If the government gives authority, is it money potentially it will never see again.
    But, this is a truly exceptional case. The essence of managing a Treasury or central
    bank, is to follow two rules: don''t inflate the currency and provide conspicuous
    liquidity in panics. Pulling money out of the system during panics is counterproductcive,
    as Friedman and Schwartz documented in their seminal Monetary History of the United
    States. This panic is highlighting why Hoover and the Federal Reserve chiefs at
    that time thought it was prudent to take money away from banks during the depression:
    don''t throw good money after bad. But the issue is, people do occasionally panic
    en masse, as exampled by the lines outside of IndyMac, even though their deposits
    are guaranteed and the government has never Welshed on this guarantee.'

  zh: 现在这非常有趣，因为我可以理解两种立场。如果政府给予权力，它就可能再也看不到这笔钱了。但是，这真的是一个特殊的例子。管理财政部或中央银行的要点在于遵循两条规则：不要通货膨胀，以及在恐慌时提供大量流动性。在恐慌期间，从系统中提取资金是适得其反的，正如弗里德曼和施瓦兹在他们的重要著作《美国货币史》中所记录的。这次恐慌正突显出为什么胡佛和当时的美联储主席认为在大萧条期间从银行取走钱是明智之举：不要用坏钱去救好钱。但问题在于，人民偶尔会集体恐慌，正如印第马克银行外面排队的人所表明的那样，尽管他们的存款是得到了保证，而且政府从未违背过这一承诺。
- en: 'But the question was put well by Bunning: Why should I believe you? This was
    in reference to Paulson''s opinion they would not actually use the guarantee.
    Paulson''s answer was, he believes it himself, and has worked in finance for a
    long time. I think instead he should have outline why he things Freddie and Fannie
    are viable long run. One thing he could have pointed to, was that delinquency
    rates for new pools are declining, so we have turned the corner. A second reason
    is that a big part of that reason is that they get cheaper funding than all their
    competitors via the government backing, which is a huge advantage in a scale game.
    Of course, this is kind of embarrassing, because Fannie and Freddie have traditionally
    been the primo patronage jobs in DC, and and so it''s pretty sordid thing we are
    saving. But now is not the time to kill them. I would rather provide them with
    liquidity, then slowly constrain the relevant mortgage sizes for which they get
    Federal backup.'

  zh: 但包宁的问题问得很好：我为什么要相信你？这是指保尔森认为他们实际上不会使用这项担保的观点。 保尔森的回答是，他自己相信，而且在金融领域工作了很长时间。我认为，相反，他应该概述为什么他认为房利美和房地美在长期内是可iable的。
    他可以指出的一件事是，新池的逾期率正在下降，因此我们已经扭转了局面。 第二个原因是，这部分原因是他们获得比所有竞争对手更廉价的资金，这是规模游戏中的巨大优势。
    当然，这有点令人尴尬，因为房利美和房地美一直是DC中传统上最重要的赞助工作，因此我们正在拯救的东西相当肮脏。 但现在不是杀死他们的时候。 我宁愿给他们提供流动性，然后慢慢限制他们获得联邦支持的相关抵押贷款的规模。
