    We watch sports and learn about Usain Bolt, a most unusual man. Or my kids read
    the Guiness Book of World Records, containing stories about 1200 lb men and giant
    frogs. News is biased towards the exceptional, it takes no effort to emphasize
    it. In fact, it takes effort to see the ordinary. It's too bad people think of
    heroes as those who, for a brief moment, offered their life in some battle or
    harrowing situation, compared to the much more common heroism of providing one's
    family, not complaining, and being charitable to friends and neighbors, for decades.

    and also random chance. We hope that we can more clearly see the intrinsic qualities
    associated with, say, a rising stock, by looking at sthose stocks that went up
    10-fold last year. Yet, any extremum is probably a large random error. We simply
    can't predict the future very well, say an R2 of only 10%. Thus, a 100% stock
    return contains, on average, a 90% error. Yet, conditional up rising this much,
    this is only the mean error, its standard error is at least as large, meaning,
    any singular 100% return is probably all randomness. In this case, more analysis
    is worthless, like trying to explain a lottery number. The explanatory characteristics
    are irrelevant for these cases.

    liked to do case studies of famous financial catastrophes, and worked through
    all the sub-accounts of say, Boston Chicken, or Enron. Unfortunately, these were
    really poor archetypes, and we could found that complimenting these analyses with
    our default model made both look less relevant. The cases that made for a great
    narrative usually involved a good degree of fraud, which is difficult to detect
    in real time. In the end, the group that sold training seminars on credit analysis
    continued their program of exceptional case studies, our models simply grinded
    out boring probabilities independent of these examples, and they remain independent

- en: I find it much more fruitful to look at averages, mainly between groupings of
    interesting explanatory variables, and their correlation with the desiderata--not
    the reverse. That is, instead of looking at the top 10 stocks from last year,
    look at things like the top decile of p/e ratios, which predict stock returns
    at a much more modest level. We know these things are inversely correlated with
    returns (the value effect), so then the question is, how can I take advantage
    of this? If I combine this with cashflow/assets, or momentum, how does this work?
    Sure, it may at best add a couple percent to your annualized return, but at least
    its feasible. Needless to say, the current focus leads to an excess focus on highly
    volatile stocks, which is why I argue that these risky stocks have lower returns
    on average than their more boring counterparts.

    anyway because they lend themselves to interesting narratives. Sure it would be
    best to know the big events if you had a time machine, but living in the present,
    if you really want to predict, focus on those things that are potentially predictive,
    which generally means looking at how averages relate to averages, as opposed to
    how outliers related to averages. The latter is mainly selection bias and random
