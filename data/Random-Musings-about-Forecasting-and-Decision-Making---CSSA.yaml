- en: 'The strangest thing about the forecasting world is not that it is a dismal
    science (which it is) but rather that forecasters share some remarkably primitive
    biases. Whether you look at purely quantitative forecasts or “expert/guru” forecasts,
    they have one thing in common: ***they rarely change their opinions or methods
    in light of new information***. In fact, what I have noticed is that the smarter
    the person is and the more information they seem to possess, the less likely they
    are to change their mind.Undoubtedly this is why many genuinely intelligent and
    knowledgeable experts have blown up large funds or personal trading accounts.
    Ask a person to give you an opinion on where a market is going, and then notice
    what happens when the market goes dramatically the other way along with news announcements
    that seem to conflict with their thesis.  Most of the time this person will tell
    you that they have not changed their mind, and in fact that it is an even better
    price to buy (or short). Models or systems suffer from the same problem–they typically
    do not adjust as conditions or regimes change, nor do they observe their own profitability
    as a cue. Most economists or technical traders build a framework that assumes
    continuity and self-similarity of the environment in which a forecast was made
    in the past.'

  zh: 预测世界最奇怪的事情不是它是一门黯淡的科学（它确实是），而是预测者们分享了一些非常原始的偏见。无论你看纯量化的预测还是“专家/大师”预测，它们都有一个共同点：***他们很少根据新信息改变自己的观点或方法***。事实上，我注意到，一个人越聪明，似乎拥有的信息越多，他们改变主意的可能性就越小。毫无疑问，这就是为什么许多真正聪明而知识渊博的专家会炸掉大型基金或个人交易账户的原因。请一个人给你一个关于市场走向的看法，然后注意当市场急剧变化并伴随着似乎与他们的观点相矛盾的新闻公告时会发生什么。大多数情况下，这个人会告诉你他们没有改变主意，事实上，现在买入（或做空）的价格更好。模型或系统也存在同样的问题——它们通常不会随着条件或制度的改变而调整，也不会观察到自己的盈利作为提示。大多数经济学家或技术交易员建立了一个假设在过去进行预测的环境具有连续性和自相似性的框架。
- en: I spent my early investing experiences as a “value investor” and let me tell
    you that I learned the hard way many times that the market was more often right
    than wrong. It was uncanny how well future fundamentals were sometimes “forecasted”
    by price. At the time, I had no knowledge of technical analysis and lacked the
    intellectual framework to synthesize a superior decision-making method. Of course,
    I would ride that “under-valued” stock with a price to book ratio less than 1
    all the way to being a penny stock before I gave up. I also sold many of my winners
    far too early because their P/E indicated they were no longer undervalued. Some
    of these stocks went on to go up 400% or more, while I was content to make 25%
    profit.  I did the exact opposite with overvalued stocks or stocks with crappy
    fundamentals. I was heavily short Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as General
    Motors in early 2007! Of course,  I got my clock cleaned and got  margin-calls
    long before they plunged almost to zero. This was a case of being right, but too
    early to fight the sentiment of the crowd.

  zh: 我在早期的投资经历中是一位“价值投资者”，让我告诉你，我多次以艰难的方式学到，市场往往比错更正确。未来基本面有时以价格的方式“预测”得非常准确，这令人难以置信。那时候，我对技术分析一无所知，缺乏综合优越决策方法的智力框架。当然，我会一直持有那些价格与账面价值比小于1的“低估值”股票，直到它成为一只便士股票，然后我放弃了。我也过早地出售了许多赢家，因为它们的市盈率表明它们不再被低估了。其中一些股票的涨幅超过400%，而我只满足于获利25%。对于高估值股票或基本面糟糕的股票，我完全相反。我在2007年初大量做空房利美和房地美，以及通用汽车！当然，我被迫提前赎回，远远早于它们几乎跌至零的时候。这是一个正确的案例，但太早去与大众情绪对抗了。
- en: Credit these events for waking me up to the world of technical analysis and
    risk-management. But this still does not address how to create an intellectual
    framework to make superior decisions or forecasts. It finally dawned on me one
    day that good forecasting (or decision-making) was a dynamic process involving
    feedback. In fact, the actual information used to make the initial decisions need
    not be complex as long as you are willing to adjust after the fact. This is especially
    true the less money you have at risk at the outset. I learned this principle while
    playing cards— you can see a lot of hands with a small investment as long as you
    are willing to fold many times when the situation becomes unfavorable, and stick
    around only when the situation shows promise as more cards are revealed. In other
    words, your starting hand criteria can be somewhat loose and include hands that
    do not have a strong edge provided that you adjust properly to new information
    as the hand progresses. This sounds somewhat elementary, but revolutionary based
    on how most experts and average traders/investors make decisions. It means that
    discretionary traders should pay attention strongly to evidence that invalidates
    their initial hypothesis and be willing to even reverse their position entirely.
    It also means that traders should risk little up front, and increase positions
    as subsequent information confirms their hypothesis.In this manner, you win a
    lot more when you are right then when you are wrong.

  zh: 将这些事件归功于它们让我意识到技术分析和风险管理的世界。但这也并没有解决如何创建一个智力框架来做出更优秀的决策或预测的问题。最终有一天我意识到，良好的预测（或决策）是一个涉及反馈的动态过程。事实上，用于做出最初决策的实际信息并不需要复杂，只要你愿意事后再进行调整。这对于一开始承担的风险越小越正确。我在打牌时学到了这个原则——只要你愿意在不利情况下多次弃牌，用较小的投资可以看到很多手牌，并在情况显示有希望时才留下来，随着更多牌的揭示。换句话说，你的起手标准可以宽松一些，包括没有强大优势的手牌，只要你在牌局进行过程中适当地调整新信息。这听起来有些基础，但与大多数专家和普通交易员/投资者做出决策的方式相比，这是一种革命性的方法。这意味着主观交易者应该强烈关注证据，这些证据否定了他们的初步假设，并愿意甚至完全反转他们的立场。这也意味着交易者应该在开始时承担很少的风险，并在后续信息证实他们的假设时增加头寸。这样，当你正确时，你会赢得更多，而不是当你错误时。
- en: In fact, the whole philosophy of trend following has this general mentality–but
    what is critically absent is the whole rationale for making the trade in the first
    place! Trend-followers win for many reasons, but primarily because certain fundamental
    events and crowd psychology develop and cause prices to move to extremes in a
    feedback loop that is gradual enough to create a discernible trend. The best combination
    is to take a fundamental hypothesis about risk and reward and use the trend and
    risk-management techniques to capitalize on it. This way, you have some sense
    of risk versus reward in advance that may create a situation with superior payoffs
    to just the standard edge of a conventional trend entry. Of course there are many
    ways to improve upon this simple framework–but at least it is a good start. Quantitative
    forecasting models or systems should take the same tact to create superior performance.
    More interestingly, a forecasting model need not be highly predictive at all by
    itself— as long as the errors that it makes are systematic and predictable, it
    can be actually highly useful. This is where many experts miss the boat– a low
    model r-squared can appear useless, but actually be far more valuable than a high
    r-squared model once the adjustment is made to model the sources of error.

  zh: 实际上，整个趋势跟踪的哲学都有这样一种普遍心态——但关键缺失的是最初进行交易的整体逻辑！趋势跟踪者之所以成功有很多原因，但主要是由于某些基本事件和群体心理的发展，导致价格在逐渐反馈循环中走向极端，从而形成可识别的趋势。最好的组合是对于风险和回报有一个基本假设，并利用趋势和风险管理技巧来利用它。这样，你可以在事先对风险与回报有一定的认识，这可能会创造一个比传统趋势进入标准边缘更有优势的状况。当然，有很多方法可以改进这个简单的框架——但这至少是一个好的开始。量化预测模型或系统应该采取同样的策略来创造卓越的性能。更有趣的是，预测模型本身并不需要非常具有预测性——只要它犯的错误是系统化和可预测的，它实际上可以非常有用。这是许多专家错过的地方——低模型r-平方可能看起来没有用，但实际上，一旦对错误来源进行调整，比高r-平方模型更有价值。
