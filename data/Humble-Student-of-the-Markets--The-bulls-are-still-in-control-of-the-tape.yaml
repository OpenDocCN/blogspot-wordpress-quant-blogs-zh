- en: You can tell the tone of a market by the way it reacts to news. On Monday, US
    stocks were down substantially on fears of a government shutdown. So when the
    government shut down, what happened? The market rallied. On Wednesday, the market
    re-considered its decision to rally on Tuesdsay. Futures were deeply in the red
    in the pre-open and the SPX was down over 10 points at the open, but rallied to
    close at the highs of the day. Such strength in the face of negative news has
    to viewed bullishly. In addition the chart below shows that the 50-day moving
    average has acted as technical support, which the index has not breached.

  zh: 通过市场对新闻的反应，你可以判断市场的情绪。周一，美国股市因政府关门的可能性而大幅下跌。那么当政府真的关门时，发生了什么？市场反而上涨了。周三，市场重新评估了周二上涨的决定。在开盘前，期货价格大幅下跌，标普500指数开盘时下跌了超过10点，但最终收于当日高点。在负面新闻面前表现出这种强势，必须被视为看涨的信号。此外，下面的图表显示，50日均线已经作为技术支撑发挥了作用，指数尚未突破该均线。
- en: As confirmation of the bullish outlook, consider the behavior of the higher
    beta small cap Russell 2000 Index, which has been the leadership in the latest
    advance. The Russell 2000 has staged multiple upside breakouts in this environment
    and remains in an uptrend.

  zh: 为了确认看涨的立场，考虑一下近期领涨的高贝塔小盘股罗素2000指数的行为。在最新的上涨中，罗素2000一直是领涨指数。在当前环境下，罗素2000已经多次实现上破，并且仍处于上升趋势中。
- en: This kind of market action is reflective of the short-term supply and demand
    dynamics of the stock market. The bears just don't have the strength to push stocks
    lower despite the news backdrop. I can only conclude that the bulls remain in
    tactical control of the tape. Until fundamentals show signs of deterioration,
    my inner trader's inclination is to stay long this market.

  zh: 这种市场行为反映了股市短期内的供需动态。尽管消息面不佳，但空头就是没有力量推动股市下跌。我只能得出结论，多头仍然掌控着市场的战术主动权。除非基本面显示出恶化的迹象，否则我作为交易者的倾向是继续看涨市场。
