- en: Friday was what I call a mega-outside day. It didn't just make a higher high
    and a lower low (a regular outside day). It actually opened below the low of Thursday
    and closed above the high of Thursday. This is unusual, and in the past it has
    led to a dip over the next few days.

  zh: 周五是我所说的“超级外侧日”。它不仅仅是形成了更高的最高价和更低的最低价（一个普通的外侧日）。实际上，它的开盘价低于周四的最低价，收盘价高于周四的最高价。这是不寻常的，过去这常常导致接下来几天内的回调。

    downside occurring on day 1.
