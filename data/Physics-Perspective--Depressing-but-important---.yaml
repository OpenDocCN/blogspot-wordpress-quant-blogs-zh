    to the democratic demands of their citizens. Trade agreements’ new boosters euphemistically
    claim that they are simply after regulatory harmonization, a clean-sounding phrase
    that implies an innocent plan to promote efficiency. One could, of course, get
    regulatory harmonization by strengthening regulations to the highest standards
    everywhere. But when corporations call for harmonization, what they really mean
    is a race to the bottom.

- en: When agreements like the TPP govern international trade — when every country
    has agreed to similarly minimal regulations — multinational corporations can return
    to the practices that were common before the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts became
    law (in 1970 and 1972, respectively) and before the latest financial crisis hit.
    Corporations everywhere may well agree that getting rid of regulations would be
    good for corporate profits. Trade negotiators might be persuaded that these trade
    agreements would be good for trade and corporate profits. But there would be some
    big losers — namely, the rest of us.

- en: The secrecy might be enough to cause significant controversy for the TPP. What
    we know of its particulars only makes it more unpalatable. One of the worst is
    that it allows corporations to seek restitution in an international tribunal,
    not only for unjust expropriation, but also for alleged diminution of their potential
    profits as a result of regulation. This is not a theoretical problem. Philip Morris
    has already tried this tactic against Uruguay, claiming that its antismoking regulations,
    which have won accolades from the World Health Organization, unfairly hurt profits,
    violating a bilateral trade treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay. In this sense,
    recent trade agreements are reminiscent of the Opium Wars, in which Western powers
    successfully demanded that China keep itself open to opium because they saw it
    as vital in correcting what otherwise would be a large trade imbalance.

    to undermine environmental and other regulations. Developing countries pay a high

    investment in return is scant and controversial. And though these countries are
    the most obvious victims, the same issue could become a problem for the United
    States, as well. American corporations could conceivably create a subsidiary in
    some Pacific Rim country, invest in the United States through that subsidiary,
    and then take action against the United States government — getting rights as
    a “foreign” company that they would not have had as an American company. Again,
    this is not just a theoretical possibility: There is already some evidence that

    was kept at bay through tariffs and other trade restrictions) to high-productivity
    sectors. But when there is a high level of unemployment, and especially when a
