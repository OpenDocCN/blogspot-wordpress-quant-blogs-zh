- en: When I was a risk manager at KeyCorp in the 1990's, it was really a two-bank
    town, National City and Key. Because of Key's penchant to buy things for, oh,
    $700MM that were really worth $150MM, Nat City generally generally outperformed
    when I was there. But things changed, and as Nat City didn't do well in the last
    recession, the recent slump put a knife in their heart.

  zh: 当我在上世纪 90 年代担任 KeyCorp 的风险经理时，它真的是一个只有两家银行的市镇，国家城市和 Key。由于 Key 倾向于出价 7 亿美元收购价值实际上只有
    1.5 亿美元的东西，那时候在那里时，国家城市通常表现更好。但事情发生了变化，由于国家城市在上一次经济衰退中表现不佳，最近的低迷使他们雪上加霜。
- en: I have fond memories of KeyCorp. Like any large corporation, there was a lot
    of inefficiency, lots of Dilbert-style managers who knew very little about their
    jobs. But as I found when I went to work in the New York, and talked to other
    banks, I found that is is true at every big bank, even the ones in London and
    New York. In fact, the banks that had big, high profile investment arms tended
    to really not understand the bread and butter commercial and consumer lending
    as well, because investment banking dominated their view of things, and so up
    top you had people with no intuition for basic regional banking (commercial and
    consumer lending is not like running a portfolio of traded securities, or facilitating
    an IPO), and their best people all wanted to be on the cover of Intitutional Investor
    (i.e., investment bankers).

  zh: 我对 KeyCorp 有着美好的回忆。和任何大公司一样，其内部有很多低效率，也有许多甚至对自己工作知之甚少的 Dilbert 式管理者。但是，当我去纽约工作并和其他银行交流时，我发现每家大银行都是如此，即使是伦敦和纽约的银行也不例外。实际上，那些拥有大型、备受关注的投资部门的银行通常对基本的商业和消费者借贷知之甚少，因为投资银行业务主宰了他们的视野；那些在高处的人对基本的区域银行没有直觉（商业和消费者贷款并不同于管理交易证券组合或促进首次公开募股），而他们最优秀的员工都希望登上《机构投资者》杂志的封面（即投资银行家）。

- en: Nat City in the end. They have weathered the recent storm better than most (due
    to legacy principles I instilled in their risk management, of course!). I remember
    thinking, as the subprime disaster was happening, that we never made loans like
    that when I was there (no money down, reverse principal amortizing, no income
    verification), and I guess they still don't to any significant degree.

  zh: 是国家城市。他们比大多数人沉重的风暴经历得更好（当然要归功于我制定的遗留风险管理原则）。我记得当次级抵押贷款灾难发生时，当时说我们从未放出这种贷款（不用首付，反向本金分期付款，无需验证收入），我想他们到现在也没有太多放贷。
- en: Speaking of banking, it was funny when in Bernanke's testimony today, they talked
    about some ideas for regulating sub-prime, and Bernanke said, well, the problem
    loans in question can't be securitized anymore. Meaning, that mistake, subprime
    residential, is, like all excesses, a one-timer. Regulators are always focusing
    on the mistakes of the immediate past, and five years after the fact they have
    new legislation focused like a laser beam on, say lending to telecoms with inflated
    income statements. The next bust is never like the last, except in the broad sense
    that people expected certain collateral to stay stable, if not keep going up.
    But it was hotels and commercial real estate in 1990, telecom in 2001, and now
    residential mortgages. I guarantee the next bust will not be in telecom or residential
    mortgages because the experience of failure is just too fresh in the participant's
    minds.

  zh: 谈到银行，今天伯南克作证时还挺有趣，他们谈到了一些关于监管次级抵押贷款的想法，而伯南克说，是的，问题贷款现在已不能再进行证券化了。也就是说，那个错误，次级住宅抵押贷款，就像所有过度，只是一个一次性错误。监管者总是专注于最近的错误，而在事实发生五年之后，他们的新立法就像聚焦在如用高估收入报表借贷的电信公司上。下一次的爆炸不会是类似于上次的，除了在宏观层面上，人们期望某些抵押品保持稳定，如果不是稳步增长。但
    1990 年是酒店和商业房地产，2001 年是电信，现在则是住宅抵押贷款。我敢保证下一次的崩盘将不再是电信或住宅抵押贷款，因为失败的经验对参与者的记忆还一直犹新。
