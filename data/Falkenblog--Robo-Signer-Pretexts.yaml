- en: The robo-signer kerfluffle is a pretext to pander to the mob, just like razing
    kulaks back in the good old days. People like Paul Krugman, who's id leads his
    superego rather directly, suggest that those signatures affirming that some person
    owns the mortgage on some property and hasn't paid, may not have had first-hand
    information to that effect. They may have been using hearsay information. This
    is the kind of legal breach is hardly a grand problem that must be addressed prior
    to further foreclosures. How many of you have clicked 'I have read the EULA agreement'
    when downloading software without actually doing so? Is that a problem?

  zh: 机器签名事件只是为了迎合暴民，就像往昔好时光里破产国家中的富农一样。像保罗·克鲁格曼这样的人，他的本我直接引导他的超我，暗示那些证明某个人拥有某处房产的抵押贷款并未付清的签名可能并没有第一手信息来证明这一事实。他们可能使用传闻信息。在进一步的强制执行之前，解决这种法律问题几乎不是一个必须解决的大问题。有多少人在下载软件时点击了“我已阅读用户许可协议”却实际上没有阅读呢？这是一个问题吗？
- en: 'The main issue is in any foreclosure is: ''When is the last time you made a
    mortgage payment?'' If it was several months ago, the rest doesn''t matter. If
    people paid their mortgage bills, robo-signers would not be problems, and if they
    don''t pay their mortgage bills, there will be a problem. Having the servicer
    spend a day on their affidavit won''t make it any more accurate, the facts are
    pretty easy to see.'

  zh: 在任何强制执行中的主要问题是：“您最后一次进行抵押贷款支付是什么时候？” 如果是几个月前，其他事情都不重要。如果人们支付了他们的抵押贷款账单，机器签名就不会有问题；如果他们不支付他们的抵押贷款账单，就会有问题。让贷款服务人员花一天时间准备他们的宣誓书并不会使其更准确，事实很容易看到。
- en: In my litigation experience I remember that it was rather pointless getting
    indignant about what my adversary was saying, because when dealing with someone
    who has bad faith, they won't be satisfied when you address their specific points.
    They would say 'this is about enforcing the law', as if a spreadsheet of the SPY
    returns since 2000, downloaded from Yahoo!, that I transferred to my home computer,
    was a violation of my confidentiality agreement. The specifics did not matter,
    it was the principle, they would say, the sanctity of contracts, the importance
    of protecting their property rights. Details being complicated, costly litigation
    commenced, which was the end game. For many people, an indefensible unstated principle
    is their end game, but because it is self-serving and petty, one can't say it
    directly. Thus, various pretexts are paraded as principle, and quickly forgotten
    once their damage has been done.

  zh: 根据我的诉讼经验，我记得对我的对手说他们的话感到愤慨是毫无意义的，因为当与一个恶意的人打交道时，当你解决他们的具体问题时，他们不会满足。他们会说“这是关于强制执行法律”，就好像2000年到现在从雅虎下载的SPY回报的电子表格，我将其转移到了家用电脑上一样，那是违反了我的保密协议。具体情况并不重要，重要的是原则，他们说，合同的神圣性，保护他们的财产权的重要性。详细情况复杂，费用高昂的诉讼开始，这就是结束游戏。对许多人来说，一个无法辩护的未经说明的原则就是他们的终极目标，但因为它是自私和琐碎的，所以不能直接说出来。因此，各种借口被作为原则进行炫耀，并一旦造成伤害，就会很快被遗忘。
