- en: It probably comes as no surprise to anyone who takes options seriously that
    the VIX is most likely to make a big move up or down on either Monday or Friday,
    but did you realize that the Friday moves are mostly up and the Monday moves are
    mostly down?

  zh: 对那些认真对待期权的人来说，VIX在周一或周五最有可能出现大幅上涨或下跌，但你是否意识到周五的变动主要是上涨，而周一的变动主要是下跌？
- en: '[![](img/945ddd17a72f53599fd9b72382486d09.png)](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/TheVIXonMondaysandFridays.gif)Today’s
    Excel cut and paste shows all the one day moves in the VIX of 10% or more since
    1990.  For starters, 61% of these have been up, while 39% have been to the down
    side.  Monday sees by far the most VIX spikes up.  If you add the 11 moves of
    10% or more that happened on Tuesdays when the markets were closed for a Monday
    holiday (i.e., those indicated by the red arrow and dashed box), the pattern of
    a large plunge on the first trading day of the week becomes even more predominant,
    with 70 sessions of a 10% or greater VIX move up (shown in green) versus only
    14 sessions with a 10% move down.  On balance, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are relatively
    light in terms of large VIX moves to the upside, with activity picking up somewhat
    on Thursdays and Fridays.'

    首先，61%的变动是上涨的，而39%是下跌的。 周一看到VIX上涨的次数是最多的。 如果你把那些在周一假期休市时发生的10%或更多的10%的变动（即由红色箭头和虚线框指示的）加上周二，那么一周首交易日的大幅下跌模式变得更加突出，有70个交易日的10%或更大的VIX上涨（以绿色显示）与只有14个交易日的10%下跌。总的来说，周二和周三在VIX上涨方面相对较轻，周四和周五的活动有所增加。'
- en: Looking at 10% VIX moves down, the trend rides a slow and steady weekday crest,
    starting from a Monday low and moving up a little each day, with Friday the big
    winner in the spike down sweepstakes.

  zh: 观察10%的VIX下跌，这种趋势沿着缓慢而稳定的周内波浪前行，从周一的低点开始，每天略有上升，周五在下跌的激增 sweepstakes 中是最大的赢家。
- en: I am not yet ready to speculate on the causes of the Friday volatility drops
    and the Monday and post-holiday Tuesday VIX surges, other than to point out that
    even following 9/11, when the country appeared to hold its collective breath over
    the weekend, this pattern seemed to hold.

  zh: 我还没有准备好推测周五波动下降和周一以及假日后的周二VIX飙升的原因，除了指出即使在9/11之后，当整个国家似乎在周末屏住呼吸时，这种模式似乎也依然存在。
- en: I will note that in the past couple of years, some of the patterns in the weekday
    trends may have weakened a little, but for the most part, they have held up in
    periods when the VIX has been at historically high levels as well as historically
    low levels.

  zh: 我要指出的是，在过去的两年里，周内趋势的一些模式可能已经稍微减弱了一些，但在VIX处于历史高点或低点的时候，大多数情况下，这些模式仍然成立。
- en: There are many potential implications to be drawn from this data.  Specific
    to the [current rise in the level of the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/7-friday-vix-spikes.html),
    keep in mind that VIX spikes on a Tuesday or a Wednesday may have more significance
    than those that straddle the weekends.

  zh: 从这些数据中可以得出许多潜在的启示。 针对[当前VIX水平的上升](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/7-friday-vix-spikes.html)，请记住，周二或周三的VIX激增可能比那些跨越周末的激增更有意义。
- en: For now I am bearish on the VIX and expect that the current VIX uptrend will
    run its course by Wednesday.  If it does not, however, I would think that 15 and
    perhaps 20 are in play before the month is over.

  zh: 目前我对VIX持悲观态度，预计当前的VIX上涨趋势将在周三结束。 如果不这样的话，我会在这个月结束前考虑15，甚至可能是20。
