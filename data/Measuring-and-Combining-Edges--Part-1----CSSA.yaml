- en: In this post we will consider the theory behind measuring and  combining edges
    from different variables and/or entire systems. As an all-purpose guide I  would
    recommend following Rob Hanna’s Quantifiable Edges [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)
    because there are a lot of practical examples of measuring and combining edges
    and many of the subtleties to consider on both his blog and more importantly in
    his subscriber letter. In terms of measuring edges, Michael at MarketSci often
    does a good job of looking at these issues from a more balanced perspective [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)
    that combines practioner insight with academic rigor.  The subject of measuring
    and combining edges in financial market data is rarely covered in textbooks and
    requires experience and judgement to either make qualitative conclusions or apply
    the right statistical methods.  The best academic/textbook on the subject is by
    David Aronson who is the author of Evidence-Based Technical Analysis [http://www.evidencebasedta.com/](http://www.evidencebasedta.com/).

  zh: 在这篇文章中，我们将考虑测量和组合来自不同变量和/或整个系统的边缘的理论。作为一个万能指南，我建议遵循Rob Hanna的Quantifiable Edges
    [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)，因为那里有很多关于测量和组合边缘的实用例子，以及他博客上和更重要的是他订阅信件中需要考虑的许多细微差别。在衡量边缘方面，MarketSci的Michael经常从一个更平衡的角度来看这些问题
    [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)，结合实践者的洞察力和学术严谨性。在金融市场数据中测量和组合边缘的主题在教材中很少被涉及，需要经验和技术判断来得出定性结论或应用正确的统计方法。该领域最好的学术/教材是由David
    Aronson撰写的，他是《基于证据的技术分析》 [http://www.evidencebasedta.com/](http://www.evidencebasedta.com/)的作者。
- en: The truth is that economists, quants,  and academics are often quite guilty
    of poor or inappropriate analysis in this area– and its very hard for practioners
    or other academics to see why. The guise of a rigorous white paper with dense
    mathematics almost always seems more convincing than the dull musings of a trader
    in a community forum or a financial blogger that puts up a 300-word post. Sadly,
    this is not actually the case. I have read academic papers that are pure garbage
    and snippets of incomplete research on a web page that are pure brilliance. Of
    course more often than not the reverse is true which leads to the general stereotype.
    The philosophy of the researcher in question is also not a panacea. Neither the
    proud skeptics nor the naiive optimists are suitable for such a task of measuring
    and combining edges in financial data.  The skeptics will overlook the time-varying
    nature of edges (a good example is the daily follow through effect) and look at
    arbitrary time intervals for analysis whose edges may also be uniquely time-varying.
    They also tend to rely too much on linear regression, and focus too much on binary
    measures of effect significance using statistics that are sometimes unsuitable
    for the data.  Furthermore, these skeptics are overly enthusiastic about robustness
    analysis across assets or parameters as if this was the only reliable pre-requisite
    for an exploitable edge. The naiive optimists are short on analytical rigor, and
    fail to view any edges that they find within the broader context of an effect.
    They think that they are finding unique edges that often mere artifacts of the
    data, and have too little statistical power to draw any conclusions from. The
    optimists also fail to see the time-varying nature of edges and also fail to perform
    simple analysis using medians, quartiles or deciles. The optimists make too many
    mistakes to list, and are the most frequent casualties in financial markets in
    real-life trading.

  zh: 事实是，经济学家、量化分析师和学者们在这个领域常常犯下拙劣或不恰当的分析错误——这对于从业者或其他学者来说很难看出原因。一篇有着严密数学论证的严谨白皮书几乎总是比一个交易员在社区论坛上的乏味牢骚或一个金融博主发表的300字帖子更有说服力。遗憾的是，实际情况并非如此。我读过一些学术文章，纯粹是垃圾，也读过一些网页上的研究片段，纯粹是天才之作。当然，通常情况正好相反，这导致了普遍的刻板印象。研究者本人的哲学思想也不是万能的。既不是骄傲的怀疑论者，也不是天真的乐观主义者，都不适合进行金融数据中衡量和结合边缘的任务。怀疑论者会忽略边缘的时间变化性质（一个好例子是每日跟进效应），并选择任意时间间隔进行分析，而这些边缘也可能是唯一的时间变化。他们还倾向于过分依赖线性回归，并且过于关注使用有时不适用于数据的统计学方法，对效应显著性的二元度量。此外，这些怀疑论者对跨资产或参数的鲁棒性分析过于热情，仿佛这是获得可利用边缘的唯一可靠前提。天真的乐观主义者缺乏分析严密性，未能将他们在更广泛效应中找到的任何边缘纳入考虑。他们认为自己在找到独特的边缘，而这些往往只是数据的偶然产物，统计功效太低，无法得出任何结论。乐观主义者还未能看到边缘的时间变化性质，也未能进行简单的中位数、四分位数或十分位数分析。乐观主义者犯的错误太多，无法一一列举，而在金融市场的实际交易中，他们是最大的受害者。
- en: 'Financial data is very noisy, and it makes it very difficult to use classical
    forecasting techniques like regression.  Such analysis relies on determining the
    slope of the relationship, as well as the line that best describes the fit.  While
    the slope can be found with some degree of reliability in financial data to be
    useable, the  y-intercept estimation creates considerable added error when the
    noise content (the scatterplot points are all over the place) is high. It is more
    useful in practice to focus on the beta/slope and omit the y-intercept altogether.
    Furthermore, trying to extrapolate the slope relationship as a scalar function
    is also fraught with error as significant non-linearities can exist at different
    areas of the variable distribution.  It is safest to simply look at the slope
    relationship between two variables or correlation coefficient as being either
    a positive or a negative relationship. Looking at the strength of this relationship
    in terms of w% or the equity curve more importantly is far superior than looking
    at it through the lens of classic regression output. The r-squared of the equity
    curve based on predicted direction of a given market is preferred to looking at
    a variable’s power to explain variation in returns ( the scatterplot points).
    Tracking this curve is highly important to detect if there has been a clear an
    discernible change in the relationship. To the extent that this is the case the
    following two inappropriate conclusions are typically made: 1) the variable has
    an edge even though that edge no longer persists in the recent part of the data
    set 2) the variable doe not have an edge even though the edge is clear and discernible
    from a more recent starting point versus the entire data set.'

  zh: 金融数据非常嘈杂，这使得使用诸如回归分析的传统预测技术变得非常困难。这种分析依赖于确定关系斜率以及最佳描述拟合情况的直线。虽然金融数据中的斜率可以以某种可靠性被找到以供使用，但在噪声含量高（散点图中的点到处都是）时，y
    轴截距的估计会带来相当大的额外误差。在实践中，最好只关注 beta/斜率，并完全省略 y 轴截距。此外，试图将斜率关系作为标量函数进行外推也充满了误差，因为变量分布的不同区域可能存在显著的非线性关系。最安全的方法是简单地观察两个变量之间的斜率关系或相关系数，以确定其为正相关或负相关。从
    w% 或股本曲线角度衡量这种关系的强度，远比通过经典回归输出观察要优越得多。基于给定市场预测方向的股本曲线的 r-squared 相对于观察变量解释收益变异的能力（散点图中的点）更为可取。跟踪这条曲线在检测变量之间关系是否发生了清晰可辨的变化方面具有重要意义。在这种情况下，通常会得出以下两个不恰当的结论：1)
    变量即使在其最近数据部分不再存在优势，也具有优势；2) 变量即使从与整个数据集相比更近的起点来看优势清晰可辨，也不具有优势。
- en: 'Unfortunately there is no concrete guide to determine how long the measurement
    period for analysis should be and whether or not this is even effective in real-life.
    Whether in the first case an academic or practioner believes that an edge still
    exists but there is a temporary deterioration is actually a correct assessment
    depends on nature of the effect itself as much as the nature of the analysis.
    The effects can possess the same properties as time series data: they can be random,
    mean-reverting, or trending. Furthermore, only after this is accounted for can
    one attempt to determine whether an effect has lost its edge or merely taking
    a temporary respite. At this point one must have a strong understanding of the
    confidence intervals of a given effect as well as the standard deviation in the
    assessment of confidence figure itself which can be quite significant in the short-term
    with few observations . Lastly, the effect may be moderated by a third spurious
    variable that may yield very clear results while the effect proxy variable (the
    current variable) shows inconsistencies.'

  zh: 不幸的是，没有确切的指南来确定分析的测量期应多长，以及这即使在现实生活中是否有效。无论是在第一种情况下，学者或从业者认为优势仍然存在，但存在暂时的恶化，这实际上是对情况的正确评估，这取决于效应本身以及分析的性质。这些效应可以具有时间序列数据的相同属性：它们可能是随机的、均值回归的或趋势性的。此外，只有在考虑了这一点之后，才能尝试确定效应是否失去了其优势，还是仅仅暂时休息。在此时，您必须对给定效应的置信区间有深入的了解，以及置信数字本身评估中的标准差，这在短期内观察到的数据很少时可能相当显著。最后，该效应可能受到第三个伪变量的调节，该伪变量可能会产生非常清晰的结果，而效应代理变量（当前变量）则表现出不一致性。
