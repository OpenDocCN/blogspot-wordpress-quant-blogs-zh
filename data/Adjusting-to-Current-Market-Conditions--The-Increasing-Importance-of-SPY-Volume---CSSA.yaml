    in this case over the last 3 months. Below I present a quick and dirty analysis-
    not as thorough as I would prefer, but enough to highlight some useful data that
    you can further explore. One of the interesting factors that has become quite
    predictive in todays market–at least in predicting the S&P500– is SPY volume.
    More specifically, the 5-day ROC  or 5-day simple moving average of SPY volume
    has performed quite admirably as a market timing indicator. I suppose all of us
    can listen to the  “experts” yap away whether bullish or bearish on CNBC , but
    ultimately the best way to see what their intentions are these days is to look
    at their cards so to speak. It isn’t Mom and Pop that are responsible for increasing
    volume when SPY trades roughly $25 billion dollars a day. No, its the big money
    responsible for doing that–whether its the US government, the banks, or mutual
    funds–it really doesn’t matter. Whenever they buy these days, they are signalling
    the intention of buying over a series of days. Whenever the buying momentum starts
    to fall, the market loses traction. Lets look at the stats over the last 60 trading
    days. Note 5dROC SPY volume stands for the 5-day rate of change of SPY volume–for
    example a positive number indicates that SPY volume is higher than 5 trading days
    ago. “C” stands for today’s close, and C(-1) stands for yesterday’s close. “V”
    stands for today’s SPY volume and V(-1) stands for yesterday’s SPY volume:'

- en: These days the most bullish configurations involve rising volume momentum, while
    the most bearish involve falling volume momentum. Specifically of note are what
    some technical analysts sometimes refer to as “accumulation days” when the market
    is strong, but the market falls today on rising volume (although there are so
    many widespread opinions on volume it is better to look at results). In this particular
    setup, the market has risen an incredible 87% of the time with an average daily
    return of .5% over the last 3 months–although this has only occured 15 times.
    Another highly bullish configuration has been when the 5-day ROC of SPY volume
    was higher, but today volume was lower than yesterday– this led to nearly 88%
    winners with an even higher gain per trade of .62%. Screening for all three (higher
    5-day ROC SPY volume, lower volume today and a lower close)  produced far too
    few instances to draw conclusions but they were both winners with an average gain
    of 1.41%. The most bearish configuration has been when 5-day ROC of SPY volume
    has fallen, and today’s close has also fallen–only 8 occurences but in this bull
    market this situation has led to only 37.5% winners and a negative  average daily
    return of -.58%. Another more common situation worth considering is when both
    volume measures have fallen- both the 5-day, and today’s volume versus yesterday.
    This happened 21 times in the last 60 days, and only 48% were winners with the
    market losing -.22% in these instances.

  zh: 这些天，最乐观的配置涉及上升的成交量动能，而最悲观的则涉及下降的成交量动能。特别需要注意的是一些技术分析师有时所称的“积累日”，当市场强势时，但市场今天在上升的成交量下下跌（尽管对于成交量有许多普遍意见，最好还是看结果）。在这种特殊的情况下，市场在过去3个月中已经上涨了令人难以置信的87%，平均每日回报率为0.5%
    —尽管这仅发生了15次。另一个高度乐观的配置是当SPY成交量的5日ROC较高，但今天的成交量低于昨天时— 这导致近88%的获胜者，每次交易的收益甚至更高，为0.62%。筛选这三种情况（较高的5日ROC
    SPY成交量，今天的成交量较低，以及较低的收盘价）产生了太少的实例以得出结论，但它们都是获胜者，平均获利1.41%。最悲观的配置是当SPY成交量的5日ROC下降，而今天的收盘价也下跌时—只发生了8次，但在这牛市中，这种情况导致了只有37.5%的获胜者，以及负的平均日回报率为-0.58%。另一个更常见的值得考虑的情况是当两种成交量指标都下降-即过去5天的成交量和今天的成交量与昨天相比。在过去60天中发生了21次，只有48%是获胜者，在这些情况下市场损失了-0.22%。
- en: So what should we take from this? Markets are always changing, and there tends
    to be predictable momentum in market behavior over time. What is working over
    the last 3 months is generally a little early to draw strong conclusions, but
    it is at the point of becoming relevant especially when looking at next day returns
    that have more degrees of freedom versus longer-term strategies. In this case
    you  might want to consider the impact volume in the current market to help time
    trades–even if you are not trading the SPY. In a market that has shown tremendous
    bullish momentum, and has proven really tricky, this is one indicator that has
    provided some clarity–amazingly it has been able to predict when the market is
    likely to fall. Certainly, it has been a strong predictor of when it will rise.

  zh: 那么我们应该从中得出什么结论呢？市场始终在变化，随着时间的推移，市场行为往往具有可预测的动量。在过去3个月中有效的策略通常还为时过早做出强有力的结论，但在观察具有更多自由度的明天回报率时，它已经变得相关，尤其是在考虑较长期策略时。在这种情况下，您可能希望考虑当前市场的成交量对交易的影响-即使您没有交易SPY。在一个表现出巨大牛市动能，并且被证明非常棘手的市场中，这是一个提供了一些清晰度的指标—令人惊讶的是，它能够预测市场何时可能下跌。当然，它一直是预测市场上涨的强有力指标。
