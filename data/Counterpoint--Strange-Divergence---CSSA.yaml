    the blog forwarded me this link from Alex Roslin’s site: [http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/](http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/)Here
    is some bullish evidence at least making the case for Gold despite the bearish
    positions expressed in the COT report. This was forwarded to me by Alex Golubev–also
    a frequent reader and friend of the blog–a piece written by prominent economist
    David Rosenberg:'

  zh: 对于更多关于黄金的COT分析，博客的忠实读者和朋友Jez Liberty向我转发了亚历克斯·罗斯林网站的链接：[http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/](http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/)尽管COT报告中表达了看跌立场，但这里至少提供了一些支持黄金的证据。这是著名经济学家大卫·罗森伯格撰写的一篇文章：

- en: We are still contemplating the massive gold purchase by the Reserve Bank of
    India — the largest in at least 30 years that took up half of what the IMF intends
    to sell. Look for China to come in next.

  zh: 我们仍在思考印度储备银行的大规模购买黄金 —— 这是至少30年来规模最大的一次购买，占据了IMF拟出售黄金的一半。可以预见，中国将是下一个进入的国家。
- en: But here is the reality. All India did was bring gold to a 6% share of its total
    FX reserves from 4%. Fifteen years ago, that representation was closer to 20%.
    China has increased its gold holdings by 76% over the past six years but they
    are a mere 1.9% of the aggregate 2.2 trillion of reserves and Russia’s gold holdings
    is just under 5%. This is not the 1990s when Bob Rubin was running a hard U.S.
    dollar policy, U.S. fiscal deficits were vanishing and gold production was on
    the rise. Today’s world is exactly the opposite. Policymakers beginning in the
    1990s wanted disinflation and got it. Now they want inflation — it will take years,
    maybe a decade, but it will come. For the near-term, we are still optimistic on
    Treasury securities but be forewarned that this view has an expiry date that is
    earlier than the peak we are likely to see in gold.

  zh: 但现实是这样的。印度所做的只是将黄金占其总外汇储备的份额从4%提高到了6%。十五年前，这个比例接近20%。中国在过去六年中增加了76%的黄金持有量，但这只是总2.2万亿美元储备的1.9%，而俄罗斯的黄金持有量仅略低于5%。这不是上世纪90年代，当时鲍勃·鲁宾负责运行美国的强硬美元政策，美国财政赤字正在消失，黄金产量正在增加。如今的世界恰恰相反。从上世纪90年代开始，政策制定者们希望通缩，而他们也确实实现了这一目标。现在他们想要通胀
    —— 这将需要数年，也许是十年，但它将会到来。在短期内，我们对美国国债持乐观态度，但需要警告的是，这种观点的到期日要比我们可能看到的黄金价格峰值早。
- en: It is very clear that central banks are behaving in a way that would suggest
    that gold is now again being considered a currency within the global monetary
    system. As we said before, it is all about relative scarcity and a well-defined
    supply curve — fiat currency at this juncture does not share that quality. As
    a good friend reminded me yesterday, when the Fed was created nearly a century
    ago, it was acceptable to have at least 40% of the money supply backed by gold
    reserves. The U.S. now has 8,133 tons of gold in reserve, which equates to $285
    billion at this year’s pricing.

  zh: 很明显，各国央行的行为表明金价再次被视为全球货币体系中的一种货币。正如我们之前所说，这完全取决于相对稀缺性和一个明确定义的供应曲线 —— 目前的法定货币并不具备这种特性。就像一位好友昨天提醒我的那样，将近一个世纪前美联储成立时，将货币供应的至少40%以黄金储备支持是可以接受的。如今，美国的黄金储备量为8,133吨，按今年的价格计算相当于2850亿美元。
- en: Meanwhile, the Fed has spiked the punchbowl to such an extent that the monetary
    base now stands at $1.7 trillion. Do the math — under the old regime (which indeed
    hamstrung the Fed), the U.S. alone would need to buy an incremental $400 billion
    of bullion or the equivalent of what would be nearly four times the typical level
    of annual demand. We could do the same calculation based on M2 but we don’t want
    anyone falling off their chairs.

  zh: 与此同时，美联储的宽松政策已经导致货币基础达到1.7万亿美元。做个简单的算术题 —— 根据旧体制（确实束缚了美联储），仅美国就需要额外购买4000亿美元的金条，或者相当于几乎是典型年度需求水平的四倍。我们也可以根据M2进行同样的计算，但我们不希望有人从椅子上摔下来。
