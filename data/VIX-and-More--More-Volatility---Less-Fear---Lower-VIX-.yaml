- en: Yesterday’s rally resulted in a 6.4% jump in the SPX and pulled the 10 and 20
    day historical volatility in the SPX up to levels not seen since December. While
    very few investors are convinced that last week’s bottom is now safe, there is
    a growing sense that the markets may have backed far away enough from the precipice
    for everyone to be able to take a few deep breaths.

  zh: 昨日股市上涨导致SPX上涨6.4%，将SPX的10日和20日历史波动性推高至自12月以来未见的水平。尽管很少有投资者确信上周的低点现在已经安全，但越来越多的人认为市场已经远离悬崖边缘，足够大家深呼吸了。

  zh: 所以我们看到了更多的波动性和更少的[恐慌](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)——昨日股市上涨时VIX下跌了10.7%。

    with [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility),
    even though there is a high degree of correlation between the two.

- en: In my opinion, the reason why violent upside moves in the SPX tend to result
    in a lower VIX even in the face of rising volatility is due to several factors.
    As noted above, one of those factors is a smaller fear component of the VIX when
    markets are rising. Another important factor that depresses the VIX during a large
    jump in the SPX is the much smaller number of investors who rush to buy put protection
    without giving much concern to price. Finally, history demonstrates that for the
    most part, markets tend to fall more sharply than they rise, so statistical measures
    of volatility are likely to show greater volatility when the SPX is making a large
    move down than when it is moving up sharply.

  zh: 在我看来，SPX暴力上涨导致VIX下跌的原因有几个因素。如上所述，其中之一是市场上涨时VIX的恐慌成分较小。另一个重要因素是SPX大幅上涨时，冲向购买看跌期权保护的投资者数量较少，对价格的关注不足。最后，历史表明，市场下跌的幅度通常比上涨要大，因此统计波动率指标在SPX大幅下跌时可能会显示出比大幅上涨时更高的波动性。
- en: The chart below shows the changes in the VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    from Monday’s close to yesterday’s close. As usual, the biggest drop in the VIX
    is in the front months with the two front months show volatility dropping about
    10%. On the other hand SPX options 15 months out shows volatility dropping 6.4%,
    a relatively high ratio when compared to the front months. I submit that the distant
    months are reflecting not just a change in short-term concerns, but a sense that
    [structural volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)
    and systemic risk are much less of an issue at the present time than had previously
    been believed.

  zh: 下表显示了从周一收盘到昨日收盘VIX [期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)的变化。与往常一样，VIX在前几个月的最大跌幅中，两个前几个月的波动性下降了约10%。另一方面，15个月后的SPX期权显示波动性下降了6.4%，与前几个月相比这是一个相对较高的比率。我认为，远期月份反映的不仅仅是短期担忧的变化，还有一种感觉，即[结构性波动](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)和系统风险在当前时间的担忧程度比之前想象的要小。
