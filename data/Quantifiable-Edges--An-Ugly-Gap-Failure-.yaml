- en: The market gapped up big today but couldn’t hold on to those gains as the S&P
    500, Dow 30, and Nasdaq all finished in the red. Reading financial columns tonight
    you’ll be told that the inability of the market to hold on to its gains was a
    bad thing. The large black candlesticks are ugly. Market participants are selling
    into strength. All of which means there is likely more downside to come. But is
    any of it true?

  zh: 今天市场高开但未能守住涨幅，标普500指数、道琼斯工业平均指数和纳斯达克指数均收跌。今晚阅读财经专栏，你会被告知市场未能守住涨幅是一件坏事。大幅下跌的黑色蜡烛图形十分丑陋。市场参与者正在利用强势出售。所有这些都意味着未来可能会有更多下行。但这些说法是否真实？
- en: I ran a study on the Nasdaq 100 tonight to find instances where the index gapped
    higher by 1% or more and then closed lower on the day. I wanted to see whether
    the negativity tended to carry through to the next day or next several days. Here’s
    what I found.

  zh: 我今晚对纳斯达克100进行了研究，找出了指数跳空高开1%或更多，然后收盘低于开盘价的情况。我想看看这种消极情绪是否会延续到下一天或接下来的几天。以下是我的研究结果。
- en: Going back to 1986, the NDX has had 52 occurrences where the market gapped up
    over 1% and then finished negative on the day. It closed higher the next day 54%
    of the time. The chance of the NDX being up on any day over the period was also
    54%. Over the next 3 and 5 days the chances of the market being higher were 62%
    and 65% after a large failed gap up. The NDX has closed higher between 55.5% and
    56.5% of the time over all 3 and 5 days periods since 1986\. So looking out over
    three and five days the supposedly negative reversal actually seems to be a positive
    for the market.

  zh: 回顾1986年以来，NDX有52次市场跳空高开超过1%，然后当天收盘为负数的情况。次日收盘价高于开盘价的概率为54%。在该时期内，NDX任何一天收盘价高于开盘价的概率也为54%。在失败的大幅跳空高开后的接下来的3天和5天中，市场上涨的概率分别为62%和65%。自1986年以来，NDX在所有3天和5天的周期内，收盘价高于开盘价的概率在55.5%和56.5%之间。因此，在未来三天和五天内，这种被认为是消极的逆转实际上似乎对市场是正面的。
- en: Even more compelling is the average gains realized over the period. For the
    1-day following the occurrence, the market gained on average 0.4%. An average
    day in the NDX since 1986 saw a gain of 0.06% - much lower. An average week for
    the NDX was about a 0.3% gain. The average week after the failed gap up? A 1.3%
    gain.

  zh: 更加引人注目的是该时期实现的平均收益。在发生跳空高开后的第一天，市场平均上涨了0.4%。自1986年以来，NDX的平均涨幅为0.06%，要低得多。 NDX的平均一周涨幅约为0.3%。失败的跳空高开后的平均一周涨幅为1.3%。
