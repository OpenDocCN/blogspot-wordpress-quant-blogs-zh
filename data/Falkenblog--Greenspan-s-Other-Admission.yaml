    a lack of regulation, or too much government meddling, was the essence of the
    problem. As we clearly had a lack of regulation on the key risk contributors,
    one could plausibly argue either, as ‘more’ regulation may have mitigated the
    problem, but it may also have encouraged greater misplaced lending under the goal
    of increasing home ownership. I imagine that debate will not be definitively answered,
    just as the causes of the financial crises of 1893, 1907, 1929-33, 1974, 1998
    are hardly settled matters among economic historians.
