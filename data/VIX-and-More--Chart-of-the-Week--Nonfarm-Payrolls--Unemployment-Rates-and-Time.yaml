- en: 'This week’s chart combines two important jobs numbers from [Friday’s employment
    report](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm): monthly changes in [nonfarm
    payroll employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    and the [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate).
    In some respects, this week’s data seemed to be conflicting, as the nonfarm payrolls
    were not as bad as expected, yet the unemployment rate was worse than anticipated.
    Part of the reason for this is that data is derived from two different sources.
    The nonfarm payrolls are the result of a survey of businesses, while the unemployment
    rate number is calculated on the basis of a survey of households.'

  zh: 本周的图表结合了来自[周五的就业报告](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)中的两个重要就业数据：[非农业工资就业](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)的月度变化和[失业率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate)。在某些方面，本周的数据似乎相互矛盾，因为非农业工资就业数据不如预期糟糕，但失业率却比预期更糟。部分原因是这些数据来自于两个不同的来源。非农业工资就业是企业调查的结果，而失业率数字是基于家庭调查计算出来的。
- en: '*[Without straying too far from the subject at hand, I want to highlight an
    often overlooked component of the nonfarm payroll that is known as the so-called
    [birth/death model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/birth%2Fdeath%20model).
    This statistical construct added 220,000 jobs to the survey results, with the
    majority of these ‘birth/death’ additions coming from the construction, hospitality
    and leisure segments. I have some skepticism about the birth/death model adjustments
    to the May data, but will leave that subject for another post. In the meantime,
    those who are interested in learning more about what I am referencing may wish
    to review:*'

- en: The chart below dates back to 1999 and captures the full history of the 2000-2003
    economic slowdown and bear market. Note that the peak monthly decline in nonfarm
    payrolls (dotted black line) was a loss of 325,000 jobs in October 2001\. The
    shaded gray area highlights the subsequent 19 months in which job losses decreased,
    yet the unemployment rate jumped from 5.3% to 6.3% during this period in what
    was known as a jobless recovery. As the chart shows, it was a full 3 ½ years before
    the unemployment rate was able to drop below and remain below the 5.3% level (dotted
    red line) of October 2001\. Worse yet, even the substantial improvement in the
    May 2009 data puts job losses at a level higher than the 2002-2003 peak. Simply
    stated, the job situation is not improving, but the rate of deterioration has
    slowed.

  zh: 下图追溯到1999年，记录了2000-2003年经济放缓和熊市的完整历史。请注意，非农业工资最大月度下降（虚线黑线）发生在2001年10月，当时损失了32.5万个工作岗位。阴影灰色区域突出显示了接下来的19个月内失业率下降，但失业率在这段时间内从5.3%上升到6.3%，这被称为失业率上升但没有新增工作的复苏。如图所示，在失业率能够降至并保持在2001年10月5.3%水平（虚线红线）以下之前，整整三年半时间已经过去。更糟糕的是，即使是2009年5月数据的显著改善，也使得失业率高于2002-2003年的峰值。简而言之，就业情况并没有好转，但恶化速度已经放缓。
- en: I have no reason to believe that the recovery from current recession will be
    any faster than the recovery from the last recession. If anything, the arguments
    for a longer deeper recession seem compelling. Even if we have the same type of
    jobs recovery that we had the last time around, however, investors may want to
    think in terms of 3-4 years or perhaps more before unemployment recedes to the
    7.6% level from the peak January job losses of 741,000.

  zh: 我没有理由相信这次的衰退恢复会比上一次的快。相反，对于更长时间、更深层次的衰退的论点似乎很有说服力。即使我们这次有与上次相似的就业恢复，投资者也许需要考虑3-4年，或者可能更长的时间，失业率才会从1月失业高峰的741,000下降到7.6%的水平。
