- en: The dusk is setting in on the world of factors and economic theory. If my views
    seem dramatic or extreme, consider that the markets did not make sense from a
    CAPM world view during the best (and simplest) of times. Today, the world markets
    are a strange and dangerous place. We are in the midst of the era of dominance
    for computerized trading (think Skynet from the Terminator). Floor trader jackets
    will soon become museum relics or sold as collector’s items on E-Bay. Most of
    the retail investors and individual traders have left the market entirely–outclassed,
    outgunned and tired of poor returns and being unable to compete. We are simultaneously
    in the throes of perhaps the greatest financial mess of all time. Our pithy attempts
    to control the uncontrollable with the aide of simplistic economic theory, political
    idealism, and crony capitalism has put the world in a perilous situation. The
    stress in financial markets reflect unprecedented levels of global debt, government
    intervention, unexpected shifts in sovereign risk, and banks that can lose billions
    for no obvious reason seemingly overnight.

  zh: 因素世界和经济理论的黄昏正在降临。如果我的观点看起来戏剧化或极端，考虑一下在市场最好的（也是最简单的）时期，从CAPM世界观来看，市场并没有意义。今天，世界市场是一个奇怪而危险的地方。我们正处在计算机化交易主导时代的中心（想想终结者中的Skynet）。场内交易员的夹克很快就会变成博物馆的文物，或者在E-Bay上作为收藏品出售。大多数零售投资者和个人交易员已经完全离开了市场——被超越，被击败，对回报率低和无法竞争感到厌倦。我们同时正处在或许是有史以来最大的金融混乱之中。我们试图用简单的经济理论、政治理想主义和权贵资本主义来控制不可控制的事物，这使得世界处于危险之中。金融市场的压力反映了前所未有的全球债务、政府干预、主权风险的意外转变，以及似乎在一夜之间没有明显理由就能损失数十亿美元的银行。
- en: The complexity of the modern world, and the degree to which it is interconnected,
    has rendered simplistic linear theory almost meaningless. Human behavior- a feature
    once predictable in its hybrid version of rationality and cognitive bias- no longer
    manifests in markets as a fluid mass of “greed” and “fear”. Instead, game theory
    and behavioural finance now share equal importance as players engage in Keynesian
    beauty contests with greater than six degrees of anticipation. (not to be confused
    with six degrees of separation) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest)
    . The highly complex interaction between governments, banks, hedge funds, institutions,
    wealthy individuals, and high frequency firms is a multi-dimensional high stakes
    game where the rules change by the day. Players must interpret or anticipate others
    actions, the perception that other players have of their actions, and how rules
    might change and how this may affect their actions and perceptions. And this is
    a simplistic description……………..

  zh: 现代世界的复杂性以及其互联程度，使得简单的线性理论几乎变得毫无意义。人类行为——一度可以在理性和认知偏误的混合版本中预测的特征——在市场中不再以“贪婪”和“恐惧”的流动群体形式表现。相反，博弈论和行为金融学现在作为参与者进行凯恩斯式美丽竞赛（不要与六度分离混淆）[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest)
    中拥有同等的重要性。在政府、银行、对冲基金、机构、富裕个人和高频公司之间的高度复杂互动是一个多维高风险游戏，规则每天都在变化。参与者必须解读或预测他人的行为，其他玩家对他们行为的看法，以及规则可能如何变化以及这可能如何影响他们的行为和看法。这是一个简化的描述……………..
- en: The future of investing must be theory-free and focus on creating algorithms
    that can adapt to change and adequately capture the nature of complex systems.
    Ed Seykota once correctly observed that a surfer does not need to know the theory
    of fluid mechanics to learn how to surf a wave in the ocean– he needs only to
    be able to make probabilistic estimates and adjustments. This example puts the
    financial economist at odds with the scientist or the engineer. The future favors
    the practical problem-solvers, the inventors, the gamers, and the deep thinkers.
    Investing is becoming like the evolution in mixed martial arts– no single style
    or background is likely to win, nor is a stubborn resistance to learning about
    other disciplines. I predict that the theory police will resist this transition
    and be left standing naked before their disciples when the tide goes out. It is
    much easier and more comforting to explain the world in deterministic terms- replete
    with graphs of marginal utility and “proofs.” Of course it is also more comforting
    to play chess than engage in a high stakes game of “liar’s poker”.

  zh: 投资的未来必须是理论自由的，并专注于创建能够适应变化并充分捕捉复杂系统本质的算法。Ed Seykota 曾经正确地观察到，冲浪者不需要了解流体力学理论来学习如何在海洋中冲浪波浪——他只需要能够进行概率估计和调整。这个例子将金融经济学家与科学家或工程师置于对立面。未来青睐的是实用问题解决者、发明家、游戏玩家和深度思考者。投资正在变得像综合格斗中的进化——没有单一的风格或背景可能会获胜，也不应该顽固抵抗学习其他学科。我预测理论警察将抵制这种转变，当潮流退去时，他们会在门徒面前裸露站立。用确定性的术语解释世界要容易得多，也更有安慰感——充满了边际效用图表和“证明”。当然，玩国际象棋也比参与高风险的“骗子扑克”游戏要舒服得多。
- en: It is important for quants to override the desire to be fed theoretical pablum
    and avoid trying to seek academic approval from high priests of a defunct religion.
    There is nothing wrong with learning finance, economics or econometrics- in fact
    it is crucial to understand these disciplines at a high level. But it is time
    to start thinking for yourself, and to stop being a sheep. Instead one should
    favor asking hard questions, learn to think independently, collaborate effectively,
    and most importantly spend their waking hours thinking about how to solve high-dimensional
    classification and game-theoretic problems.

  zh: 对量化分析师来说，克服被喂食理论垃圾的欲望，并避免试图从已废除宗教的高级祭司那里获得学术批准至关重要。学习金融、经济学或计量经济学并没有错——实际上，从高层次理解这些学科是至关重要的。但是是时候开始独立思考了，停止做一只羊。相反，应该倾向于提出困难的问题，学会独立思考，有效协作，最重要的是，花清醒的时间思考如何解决高维分类和博弈论问题。
