- en: all sorts of new regulations of the financial sector. It's a good time to be
    a regulator. As all the major financial institutions put ex-regulators in prominent
    posts in their company, the current regulators anticipate this. A financial regulator
    who plays his cards right should be very valuable after working for a couple of
    years in this new regime. If I were a lawyer, I'd get into securities law, because
    every financial firm will need senior people with legal backgrounds, who will
    be able to negotiate all the fruitless, but complicated, rules that are coming
    down the pike.

- en: The net result are rules and enforcement that, like most regulation, merely
    raises the barriers of entry. This makes it hard to enter the business, and should
    set the stage for nice monopoly profits for current players, all under the pretext
    of helping main street and the soundness of our financial system.

- en: Once you pay the fixed cost for dealing with regulators, in terms of having
    protocols for filling out the right forms in place, the effects of regulation
    are pretty small. That is, in finance, regulation is invariably a fixed cost,
    plus prohibitions on the ability to do more than one thing at a time. These are
    really the only regulations that are put in place (think about Glass-Steagall,
    interstate banking restrictions, Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Have you ever
    filled out an ADV? Signed the recent rules from Sarbanes-Oxley? Just a bunch of
    fluff, saying, in effect, you wont break the law. I guess this makes it easier
    to find and prosecute you if you break old laws, but does it promote more honesty?
    I doubt it.

- en: If I were securities czar, I would take a deep look at off-balance sheet liabilities,
    perhaps mandating they mark them to market in a footnote in their quarterly financial
    statements. Further, I would mandate greater disclosure on what securities are
    being held, on or off balance sheet. I'm still shocked by those tens of billions
    of AAA rated ABS on all those I-bank balance sheets. It made no sense, and suggested
    something really wrong was going on. But they never had to report that modest
    amount of information.
