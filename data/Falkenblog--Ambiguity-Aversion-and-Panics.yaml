- en: The rise in 'information sensitivity' across a broad cross-section of formerly
    informationally insensitive assets occurs due to fears of adverse selection, of
    buying an asset that is being sold because insiders know it is toxic. Yet it's
    interesting that when this occurs assets generally sell below their 'fair value'
    or 'net asset value' as they were in the winter of 2009, and people don't jump
    in and sieze this opportunity as they usually do.

    little knowledge his failure can be blamed on his incompetence. A bad outcome
    resulting from a pure risky prospect, on the other hand, cannot be attributed
    to poor judgment. All possible information about the risky prospect was known,
    and a failure is simply bad luck. The key is, ex post, will you look like a sucker,
    or just unlucky? Investment managers can live with bad luck, but their reputation
    is essential and they can't be seen a fool.

    had failures of Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae, two venerable institutions. It was
    not clear what the essence of the problem was--CDOs? Complexity? Banks? Mortgages?
    Copulas?--so investors simply knew that something was rotten, and it seem probable
    that some people knew what was going on, leaving one in the proverbial position
    of the guy at the poker table who doesn't know who the sucker is. This causes
    everyone to get alligator arms and jump into the least risky thing they can think
    of--the dollar, US Treasuries. With investment down, profits plummet, leading
    to a general recession.
