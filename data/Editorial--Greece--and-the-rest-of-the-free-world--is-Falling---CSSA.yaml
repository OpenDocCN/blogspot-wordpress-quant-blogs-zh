- en: The fears about Greece and their potentially imminent insolvency are well-documented
    so I won’t attempt to rehash the facts. Part of the story is about the classic
    battle between the “working man” and the government over pension issues, as well
    as the tremendous cost of high unemployment. It is also a story about the insidious
    rise of socialism (big government) that often follows fiscal irresponsibility.
    The fall of Greece is a sad saga of a country that went overboard with debt financing
    and in many ways is emblematic of what is happening in the United States and all
    over the world.

  zh: 关于希腊及其潜在的即将破产的担忧已经有充分的记录，所以我不会试图重复说明事实。故事的一部分是关于“工人阶级”与政府之间在养老金问题上的经典斗争，以及高失业率带来的巨大成本。这也是一个关于随着财政不负责任而常常出现的社会主义（大政府）的阴险崛起的故事。希腊的沦陷是一个悲伤的故事，一个国家过度依赖债务融资，在许多方面象征着美国和全世界正在发生的事情。
- en: 'Capitalism always takes the rap when things go south in the economy. Unfortunately
    the real issue is that most of the poor decisions that lead to economic problems
    are the result of the flawed and socially-permitted incentive structures within
    the government that influence policy and regulation. You see, in the good times,
    the government caters to big business to ensure healthy campaign financing. Meanwhile
    the two conspire to quietly and mercilessly screw the middle and lower class –who
    tend not to notice since their paychecks keep coming in and credit is freely available.
    In this case the government told the bankers: “Hey, I got an idea! Everybody wants
    to own a home, so lets make them happy by making it easy for them to buy so they
    won’t notice that we are taking their money!” The bankers said: “Hey great idea,
    we can lure them in for cheap and raise our rates later to get our money back!”
    In bad times (such as now), the government is on the ropes, and policy is quickly
    shifted to appeal to the “working man” and the middle class to secure enough votes
    to get re-elected. In the wake of high unemployment and unacceptable conditions,
    the public relations braintrust at the White House work feverishly to stir up
    blame revolving around the evils of capitalism, and greedy bankers. “We the government
    will protect you and save the day with new regulations to keep these criminals
    in check!”—no need to mention that the “eye in the sky” in this great casino we
    call the US economy was watching them burglarize the common man with no intervention
    the whole time.'

  zh: 当经济出现问题时，资本主义总是受到责备。不幸的是，真正的问题在于导致经济问题的大多数错误决策是政府内部存在的有缺陷且社会允许的激励结构的结果，这些结构影响政策和监管。你看，在经济好的时候，政府迎合大企业，以确保健康的竞选资金。同时，这两者密谋着悄悄地、无情地对中下层阶级进行欺骗-他们往往不会注意到，因为他们的工资继续发放，信贷是自由可得的。在这种情况下，政府告诉银行家：“嘿，我有个主意！每个人都想拥有自己的房子，所以让我们通过让他们轻松购房来让他们满意，这样他们就不会注意到我们在拿他们的钱！”银行家说：“嘿，好主意，我们可以用低价吸引他们，然后稍后提高利率来收回我们的钱！”在经济不景气的时候（比如现在），政府处于困境中，政策迅速转向以吸引“工人阶级”和中产阶级的支持，以获得足够的选票进行连任。在高失业率和不可接受的条件下，白宫的公共关系智囊团正努力煽动围绕资本主义的罪恶和贪婪银行家的指责。“我们政府会保护你们，并通过新的监管来制止这些罪犯！”-不需要提到，在我们称之为美国经济的这个伟大赌场中，“天眼”一直在看着他们无所作为地抢劫普通人。
- en: So what about Greece? Here again it almost sounds like what happened at GM a
    short while ago. Blue-collar retired workers holding a whole country hostage.
    It always bothers me that those with theoretically the lowest human capital value
    and level of education are permitted to form politically powerful unions. They
    abuse these rights to procure unfairly high wages, and also to ensure that their
    worlds exist in some protected bubble–devoid of the standard laws of economics
    where everything is always absolutely guaranteed– such as pensions and benefits.
    In contrast the rest of the world and the educated youth these days who face guaranteed
    unemployment (the highest rate for educated youth in 50 years) are expected to
    live in an uncertain world–in this case they are beholden to the rights and future
    excess tax burden of someone who drove a tractor in Greece for 30 years and now
    demands a 28,000 Euro pension. These same people who have the power to make a
    difference–in the face of the possible bankruptcy of their own country–claim that
    these issues are “not their problem” and wish to get paid regardless of the consequences.
    These are the very same people in America who in the pinnacle of hypocrisy, are
    the first to complain that executive compensation at banks following the credit
    crisis as being immoral and outrageous (which it is-no dispute there). Suffice
    to say we live in a dangerous world populated by idiots, that are now being baited
    by even dumber politicians. Watch out for the pitchforks!

  zh: 那希腊怎么样？这里的情况几乎听起来像是短时间内发生在通用汽车公司的事情。蓝领退休工人让整个国家陷入了人质困境。总是让我感到困扰的是，那些在理论上拥有最低人力资本价值和教育水平的人被允许组成具有政治权力的工会。他们滥用这些权利来获得不合理高额的工资，还确保他们的世界存在于某种受保护的泡沫之中——毫无经济规律的标准——例如养老金和福利。相比之下，其他国家和如今面临有史以来最高的受教育青年失业率的受教育青年们被期望在一个不确定的世界中生活——在这种情况下，他们被债权人谁在希腊开拖拉机工作了30年，并且现在要求每月28000欧元的养老金的权利和未来的过度税收负担所负有的责任。这些人在面临着他们自己国家可能破产的情况下拥有可以改变一切的权力——他们声称这些问题“不是他们的问题”，并且希望得到支付而不考虑后果。这些正是在美国最先抱怨在信用危机后银行高管薪酬道德和令人发指的那些人（这是不争的事实）。可以说我们生活在一个充满白痴的危险世界里，这些白痴现在又被更愚蠢的政客激怒。当心突然的蜂拥而至！
- en: On the practical versus rhetorical side, traders can get a sense of the rapid
    acceleration of fear by watching ticker NBG which is the “National Bank of Greece.”
    This low-priced dog fell a hefty 13.2% yesterday, and it looks to be threatening
    to match previous lows during the credit crisis. Personally i think using a multi-day
    back-ended scaling strategy here after another big down day (perhaps 15-20%) could
    lead to a quick but highly speculative 50%+ gain. In this case a back-end scale
    would start by building up to a full position starting with 5%, then 10%, 20%
    30%, and finally 35% of the desired bet size (ie if you wanted to risk $10,000,
    you would start with $500, $1000 etc). The general idea is that prices will probably
    fall after purchase, but if you scale in without risking too much up front you
    will come close to the short-term bottom. Even if NBG goes bankrupt eventually
    it won’t happen overnight—thus a short-covering spike is a good bet that even
    Bear Stearns experienced. Hedging this position with SKF is also useful, as it
    will protect you from a protracted fall, and SKF will not likely fall 50% when
    the rebound day for NBG finally occurs. The good old days of fear and volatility
    are back, and if you are quick and contrarian you can profit from it. Thankfully
    the stock market is our last bastion of capitalism—use while you still can!

  zh: 在实际与修辞的对比中，交易员可以通过观察“希腊国家银行”的股票代号NBG的走势来感受到恐惧的迅速加剧。这只低价股昨天大跌13.2%，看起来似乎威胁要达到信用危机期间的先前低点。我个人认为在另一个大幅下跌之后使用多天背加权比例策略可能会导致一次快速但高度投机的50%以上的收益。在这种情况下，后方比例将从5%开始构建到完整持仓量，然后是10%、20%、30%，最后是所需赌注大小的35%（如果你想要冒险投资10000美元，你会从500美元开始，接着1000美元，等等）。总体想法是购买后价格可能会下跌，但如果你在前期不冒太大风险地逐步加仓，你将接近短期底部。即使希腊国家银行最终破产，也不会一夜之间发生——因此股价短期内会上涨是一个不错的赌注，就像熊式斯特恩公司经历过的那样。用SKF对冲这个头寸也很有用，因为它会保护你免受长时间下跌的影响，而希腊国家银行的反弹日一旦发生，SKF不太可能下跌50%。恐惧和波动的好日子又来了，如果你反应迅速且背离主流，你可以从中获利。谢天谢地，股票市场是我们最后的资本主义堡垒——在你还能利用的时候好好利用它！
