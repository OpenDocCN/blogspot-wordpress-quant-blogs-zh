    story a little earlier. In [Time for an In-VIX-Tigation?](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2008/10/time-for-in-vix-tigation.html)

    to involve the purchase of close to 300,000 puts (all of which were opening transactions
    for that strike) and a grand investment of about $150 million.

- en: This transaction pushed the VIX from a close of 53.11 on yesterday to a special
    opening quotation (for the settlement of VIX options) of 63.04, a 9.93 (18.7%)
    jump over yesterday's close. If I am able to unearth any additional details about
    this transaction, I will pass them along.
