    for this rate made by an agent-based model of mortgage repayments developed by
    John Geanakoplos working for two different Wall St. firms. There are two things
    to notice. First, obviously, the model works very well over the entire period
    up to 1999\. The second, not obvious, is that the model works well even over a
    period for which it was not designed, by the data, to fit. The sample of data
    used to build the model went from 1986 through early 1996\. The model continues
    to work well even out of sample over the final three years of this period, roughly
    30% beyond the period of fitting. (The model did not work in subsequent years
    and had to be adjusted due to a major changes in the market itself, after 2000,
    especially new possibilities to refinance and take cash out of mortgages that
    were not there before.).

    follows every single individual mortgage. It produces aggregate prepayment forecasts
    by simply adding up over all the individual agents. Each homeowner is assumed
    to be subject to a cost c of prepaying, which include some quantifiable costs
    such as closing costs, as well as less tangible costs like time, inconvenience,
    and psychological costs. Each homeowner is also subject to an alertness parameter
    a, which represents the probability the agent is paying attention each month.
    The agent is assumed aware of his cost and alertness, and subject to those limitations
    chooses his prepayment optimally to minimize the expected present value of his
    mortgage payments, given the expectations that are implied by the derivatives
    market about future interest rates.

    ordered pair (c,a) of cost and alertness, and also a turnover rate t denoting
    the probability of selling the house. The distribution of these characteristics
    throughout the population is inferred by fitting the model to past prepayments.
    The effects of observable borrower characteristics can be incorporated in the

    of some population of insects. The idea would be to  follow the density of insects
    as a function of their size, age and other features that influence how and when
    and how much they tend to consume. The more you model such features explicitly
    as a distribution of influential factors, the more likely your model will take
    on aspects of the real population, and the more likely it will be to make predictions
    about the future, because it has captured real aspects of the causal factors in

- en: '... burnout is a natural consequence of the agent-based approach; there is
    no need to add it in afterwards. The agents with low costs and high alertness
    prepay faster, leaving the remaining pool with slower homeowners, automatically
    causing burnout. The same heterogeneity that explains why only part of the pool
    prepays in any month also explains why the rate of prepayment burns out over time.'

- en: One other thing worth noting is that those developing this model found that
    to fit the data well they had to include an effect of "contagion", i.e. the spread
    of behavior directly from one person to another. When prepayment rates go up,
    it appears they do so not solely because people have independently made optimal
    decisions to prepay. Fitting the data well demands an assumption that some people
    become aware of the benefit of prepaying because they have seen or heard about
    others who have done so.

  zh: 另外还有一点值得注意的是，开发这个模型的人发现，为了很好地拟合数据，他们必须包括“传染”效应，即行为直接从一个人传播到另一个人。当预付款率上升时，看来他们这样做不仅仅是因为人们独立地做出了预付的最佳决策。拟合数据的好要求假设有些人意识到预付的好处，因为他们看到或听说过其他人这样做。
- en: This is how it was possible, going back up to the figure above, to make accurate
    predictions of prepayment rates three years out of sample. In a sense, the lesson
    is that you do better if you really try to make contact with reality, modelling
    as many realistic details as you have access to. Mathematics alone won't perform
    miracles, but mathematics based on realistic dynamical factors, however crudely
    captured, can do some impressive things.
