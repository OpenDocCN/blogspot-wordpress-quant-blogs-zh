- en: Lately it seems like I am the only one who is *not* talking about the VIX. I
    find it particularly ironic that many of the same people who were pounding the
    table saying that the market could not bottom unless there was another dramatic
    VIX spike and high volume capitulation are now insisting that the markets cannot
    rally from current levels until the VIX continues down. I suspect these pundits
    will end up going 0 for 2 in their predictions.

  zh: 最近似乎只有我没有在谈论VIX。我发现许多曾经拍桌子说市场无法触底，除非有另一个剧烈的VIX波动和高量投降的人，现在坚持认为市场不能从当前水平反弹，直到VIX继续下跌。我怀疑这些评论家最终会在预测上颗粒无收。
- en: For the record, at the very moment the SPX formed the “[devil’s bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/devil%27s%20bottom)”
    of 666.79 on March 6^(th), the VIX was at 51.65, which was not even the high for
    the particular day. By the end of the day, the VIX was down to 49.33 in what looks
    in retrospect like a classic [stealth bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stealth%20bottom).

  zh: 记录在案，就在标普形成于3月6日的[666.79的“魔鬼之底”](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/devil%27s%20bottom)时，VIX为51.65，这甚至不是当天的高点。到了当天结束时，VIX跌至49.33，这在回顾中看起来像是一个典型的[隐蔽之底](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stealth%20bottom)。
- en: So what is driving the VIX right now? In a [previous post](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/markets-continue-to-fall-vix-relatively.html),
    I opined that a simplistic conceptual model of the VIX is one which “incorporates
    incremental changes in uncertainty and [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    on top of recent historical volatility.” Many of the common measures of historical
    volatility (10, 20, 30 and 50 day) show that historical volatility in the SPX
    topped in the middle to latter portion of March. Since the 7.08% jump in the SPX
    on March 23^(rd), trading has been relatively subdued from a volatility perspective.
    As that 7.08% jump as well as the 6.37% and 4.07% jumps from March 10^(th) and
    March 12^(th) begin to scroll off the lookback window, historical volatility numbers
    should begin to lead the VIX back down.

  zh: 那么是什么推动了VIX的上涨？在我[先前的帖子](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/markets-continue-to-fall-vix-relatively.html)中，我提出了一个简单的VIX概念模型，即“包含不确定性的逐步变化以及最近历史波动上的[恐惧](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)”。许多常见的历史波动度量（10、20、30和50天）显示，标普的历史波动在3月中旬的中后期达到顶峰。自3月23日标普上涨7.08%以来，从波动性角度来看，交易一直相对平静。随着3月10日和3月12日分别出现的7.08%、6.37%和4.07%的上涨逐渐淡出回顾窗口，历史波动率数字应该开始引导VIX回调。
- en: As far as fear and uncertainty are concerned, the fear of a global systemic
    bank failure seems to be receding, while concerns about a deepening global recession
    are lingering and still rising in some quarters. The G-20 meeting underscored
    the willingness of leaders of the world’s largest economies to coordinate their
    activities, even if they cannot agree on the details of those coordinated efforts.

  zh: 关于恐惧和不确定性，全球系统性银行破产的恐惧似乎正在消退，而关于全球经济深度衰退的担忧仍然挥之不去，在一些地区还在上升。G-20会议凸显了世界最大经济体领导人的意愿，他们愿意协调各自的活动，即使他们无法就协调努力的细节达成一致。

- en: The bottom line is that current levels of the VIX are in line with historical
    volatility readings and changes in the macroeconomic landscape. The fear component
    of the VIX is clearly on the wane, which should mute any VIX spikes. On the other
    hand, historical volatility needs to continue to decline and the VIX term structure
    (which is based on SPX options) and VIX futures need to soften somewhat before
    the VIX can reasonably be expected to start trading in the 30s on a regular basis.

  zh: 总之，当前VIX的水平与历史波动率读数及宏观经济景观的变化相符。VIX的恐慌成分显然正在减弱，这应该可以抑制任何VIX的大幅波动。另一方面，历史波动率需要继续下降，VIX期限结构（基于SPX期权）和VIX期货需要有所软化，人们才能合理地期待VIX开始定期交易于30年代。
- en: Many analysts have a tendency to rely too heavily on charts when looking at
    the future of the VIX. While charts can provide some useful information and it
    is nice to know that the VIX has recently moved below its 200 day moving average,
    sometimes putting the VIX in the proper geopolitical and macroeconomic context
    is a more valuable approach.

  zh: 许多分析师在展望VIX的未来时倾向于过分依赖图表。虽然图表能提供一些有用的信息，了解到VIX最近跌破了其200日移动平均线是令人欣慰的，但有时将VIX置于正确的地缘政治和宏观经济背景中是一种更有价值的方法。
- en: So…I think the VIX is about where it should be right now and stocks can resume
    their move up without the VIX being required to plummet. In fact, if the bulls
    continue to keep the upper hand, expect the VIX to decline in a decidedly gradual
    fashion.

  zh: 所以……我认为VIX目前大致处于应有的位置，股市可以在不要求VIX暴跌的情况下恢复其上涨。实际上，如果多头继续占据上风，预计VIX会以一种明显的逐渐方式下降。
- en: Finally, the VIX jumped 3.1% today, while the SPX lost 0.83%. That -4x move
    is typical of the VIX, but not on [Mondays](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Monday),
    when ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    usually means the VIX jumps about 1.5%. Add to this the 1.53% that the VIX fell
    during the 4:00 – 4:15 p.m. ET index trading portion of Friday’s session and one
    could make the argument that the VIX barely moved at all today relative to the
    SPX.

  zh: 最后，VIX今天跳升了3.1%，而SPX下跌了0.83%。这种-4倍的动作是VIX的典型表现，但不是在[周一](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Monday)，因为当天的“[日历反转](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)”通常意味着VIX会跳升大约1.5%。再加上周五交易时段下午4:00至4:15
    ET期间VIX下跌的1.53%，可以说VIX今天的表现相对于SPX几乎没有任何变动。
