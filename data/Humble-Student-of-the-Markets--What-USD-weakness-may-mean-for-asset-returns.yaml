- en: An unusual anomaly arose during the latest banking crisis when a long-standing
    historical relationship broke apart. When bank stocks skidded in response to the
    problems that first appeared at Silicon Valley Bank, the 2-year Treasury yield
    fell dramatically, indicating a rush for the safety of Treasury assets. What was
    unusual this time was the weakness in the USD. The greenback has rallied during
    past financial scares and crises as investors piled into the safety of the USD
    and Treasury paper. This time, Treasuries did reflect a flight to safety, but
    not the USD. As the USD has been inversely correlated to the S&P 500, and the
    dollar can’t advance even with the macro tailwind of a banking crisis, what does
    this mean for asset returns?

  zh: 在最近的银行危机期间，出现了一个不寻常的异常现象，当硅谷银行首先出现问题时，银行股票暴跌，而2年期国债收益率大幅下降，表明资金涌入国债资产的安全性。这次不同寻常的是美元的弱势。在过去金融恐慌和危机中，投资者纷纷涌入美元和国债的安全怀抱，美元汇率应声上涨。这一次，尽管国债反映了资金寻求安全的心态，但美元却没有。由于美元与标普500指数呈负相关，且在银行危机的宏观尾风下，美元也无法升值，这对资产回报意味着什么？
