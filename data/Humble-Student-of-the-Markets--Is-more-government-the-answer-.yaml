- en: Were there objections that I pointed out that guns are part of American culture?
    There are benefits to gun ownership, just as there are benefits to owning a car.
    Were readers upset that I pointed out that there are risks to gun ownership? Guns
    are, by definition, dangerous - they are designed to kill and having a weapon
    in your house and possession raise your risk level, just as owning a car is risker
    (you can run over people with it). The debate is over whether the benefits outweigh
    the risks.

  zh: 有没有人指出我说过枪支是美国文化的一部分？拥有枪支有好处，就像拥有汽车有好处一样。读者是否因为我指出枪支拥有有风险而感到不安？枪支，按定义，是危险的——它们被设计用来杀死人，你家里有武器在你的控制下会提高你的风险水平，就像拥有汽车更有风险（你可以用它压人）。争论的焦点是好处是否超过了风险。
- en: What I do find curious is that the gun ownership constituency tends to be of
    the "get the government off my back" variety and, at the same time, the NRA's
    called on the federal government to station police officers in every school in
    the country.

  zh: 令我感到好奇的是，枪支拥有群体往往属于“让政府离我远点”的类型，与此同时，全国步枪协会呼吁联邦政府在全国每一所学校部署警察。
- en: Is this where we've come to? A "get the government off my back" crowd calling
    for more government? How about deploying elements of the 101st Airborne or 4th
    Mountain in schools? Wouldn't that deter the "bad" guys even more?

  zh: 这真的是我们走到了这一步吗？一个“让政府离我远点”的群体在呼吁更多政府干预？那是不是应该在学校部署第101空降师或第4山地师的元素？那样岂不是更能威慑“坏人”？
- en: If you do believe in gun ownership and your philosophy is "less government is
    better government", then there is a better way forward - let the market do it.

    qualified could be allowed to own a gun. Just as car ownerships are required to
    have insurance, gun owner should be required to carry a large level of liability
    insurance in case the guns under his control are used improperly.

  zh: 就像一定年龄以上的人被允许拥有汽车一样，有资格的人可能被允许拥有枪支。就像汽车拥有者需要保险一样，枪支拥有者应该被要求携带高额的过失保险，以防他控制下的枪支被不当使用。
- en: That way, we can let the market regulate gun ownership rather than the government.
    Insurance companies are in the business of pricing risk and they should be able
    to price the cost of gun ownership properly. That way, the market can create barriers
    to the "crazies" owning guns.

  zh: 那样子，我们就可以让市场调节枪支拥有，而不是政府。保险公司是风险定价的业务，他们应该能够正确地定价枪支拥有成本。那样，市场就可以为“疯狂”的人拥有枪支创造障碍。
- en: No doubt, the level of gun ownership will decrease under such a proposal, but
    the "right kind" of gun ownership, i.e. responsible ones, will be largely unaffected.
    In America, everyone who is qualified is allowed to own a car, but not everyone
    is owns one because of the costs involved. Under this proposal, the free market
    would tend to weed out the higher risk cases.

  zh: 毫无疑问，在这种提议下，枪支拥有率将会下降，但“正确类型”的枪支拥有，即负责任的拥有，将大体不受影响。在美国，任何有资格的人都被允许拥有汽车，但并非每个人都拥有，这是由于涉及的成本。在这种提议下，自由市场将倾向于淘汰高风险案例。
