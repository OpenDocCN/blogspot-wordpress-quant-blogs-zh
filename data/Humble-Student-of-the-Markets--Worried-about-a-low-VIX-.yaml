  zh: 观察期权市场信号的另一种方式是分析VIX/VXV比率。VXV比率是指三个月后的VIX指数。因此，VIX/VXV比率是波动性期限结构的度量，或者市场对波动性如何随时间演变的预期。比率超过1，或倒置的期限结构，表明短期波动性高于未来波动性，是市场高度焦虑的信号。相比之下，低比率是市场自满的信号。

  zh: 没有什么好担心的，对吧？嗯，并不完全如此。即使你对股市的展望持乐观态度，我也会对这些股市水平持谨慎态度。对看跌/看涨比率（一个逆市场指标）的分析显示，看跌/看涨比率一直在暴跌，这在未来几天并不是一个看涨的信号。

- en: The low volatility environment is very interesting; it is rather reminiscent
    of those moments in westerns when the cavalry captain says "I don't like it. It's
    too quiet." and immediately gets an arrow through the chest. It is possible that
    the first rate rise from a central bank (some people at the Bank of England are
    getting twitchy) may be the new displacement. Euphoria stages come to an end when
    insiders take profits. Deutsche cites this happening in farmland and Hong Kong
    property but one also has to wonder about tech stocks.

  zh: 现在的VIX/VXV比率告诉我们什么？
- en: Another way of looking at the signals from the option market is to analyze the
    VIX/VXV ratio. The VXV ratio is the three-month forward VIX Index. The VIX/VXV
    ratio is therefore a measure of the term structure of volatility, or the market's
    expectation of how volatility will evolve over time. A ratio over 1, or inverted
    term structure, indicates that near term volatility is higher than future volatility
    and a sign of a high level of angst in the market. By contrast, a low ratio is
    a sign of market complacency.

    the bulls. The decline in the ratio mirrors the decline in the VIX Index (bottom
    panel). Moreover, the VIX/VXV ratio recently breached the 0.84 level, which is
    at the very bottom end of its one-year historical range. These are all signs of
    excessive complacency.

    a longer time frame. While the VIX/VXV ratio has fallen, its level can hardly
    be described as at off-the-charts lows and an indication of excessive euphoria.
    Even if we were to discount the period before 2012, when VIX levels were generally
    much higher, the VIX/VXV ratio has fallen to these levels several times before
    and declined to significantly much lower levels in the past.

    the equity market outlook, I would be a little hesitant about buying at these
    stock market levels. Analysis of the Put-Call ratio, which is a contrarian indicator,
    shows that the put-call ratio has been plummeting - and that is not a bullish
    sign over the next few days.

  zh: 在空头过于兴奋之前，让我们看看用更长的时间框架看的同样的图表。尽管VIX/VXV比率已经下降，但其水平绝不能被描述为图表最低点，也不是过度乐观的信号。即使我们要打折2012年之前的数据，当时VIX水平通常要高得多，VIX/VXV比率已经多次下降到这些水平，并在过去显著下降到更低水平。
