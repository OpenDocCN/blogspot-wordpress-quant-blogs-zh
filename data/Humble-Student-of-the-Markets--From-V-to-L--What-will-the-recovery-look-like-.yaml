- en: I suppose I should be used to it by now. Last week's initial jobless claims
    spiked to 6.6 million, and the March headline Non-Farm Payroll printed at a dismal
    -701K. The unemployment rate would have been even worse had the participation
    rate not fallen and depressed the size of the labor force. My desk has been flooded
    with bear porn.

  zh: 我想我现在应该已经习惯了。上周的首次失业救济申请激增至660万，3月非农就业数据令人沮丧，为-701K。如果参与率没有下降并压低劳动力规模，失业率会更糟。我的办公桌上堆满了看跌的材料。

    Among many, Goldman Sachs last week reduced their already downbeat forecast to
    an annualized -34% from -24%, and unemployment to reach an astounding 15%.

- en: Rather than just wallow in more unnecessary bearishness, a more useful exercise
    is to consider how the economy might evolve from BC (Before Coronavirus) to AD
    (After the Disease). What will the recovery look like? There is a wide continuum
    of recovery shapes from V to L.
