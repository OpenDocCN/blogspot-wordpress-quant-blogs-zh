    in recent months. I was quoted in saying that traders running similar quantitative
    models could contribute to market volatility. This is certainly true if the strategies
    are trend-following. What puzzles me, however, is that most statistical arbitrage
    strategies are mean-reverting: they buy during investors'' panic, and sell during
    investors'' euphoria, and should be richly rewarded in this volatile market by
    providing sorely needed liquidity. And indeed, from my own experience as well
    as hearing from other traders, mean-reverting strategies are performing very well
    recently. So where did those losses come from? My guess is that, as I have'

  zh: 关于最近几个月几家知名量化对冲基金遭受重大损失的情况。我曾表示，运行类似量化模型的交易员可能会加剧市场波动。如果这些策略是趋势追踪的，那当然是对的。然而，让我感到困惑的是，大多数统计套利策略都是均值回归的：在投资者恐慌时买入，在投资者狂热时卖出，应该在这个波动市场中因提供迫切需要的流动性而获得丰厚的回报。实际上，根据我自己的经验以及其他交易员的说法，均值回归策略最近表现非常好。那么这些损失来自哪里呢？我猜测，正如我曾经

- en: before, many traditional stat arb strategies are getting boring and generating
    diminishing returns, and therefore many of the quantitative researchers are driven
    (by their own professional pride or their bosses) to come up with more exotic
    and higher-return strategies that ultimately may not stand the test of time. For
    us quants, remembering Occam's razor and that our job is to generate returns as
    opposed to producing brilliant mathematical models is often a hard lesson to learn.

  zh: 在此之前，许多传统的统计套利策略变得无聊，产生的回报逐渐减少，因此许多量化研究人员（出于自己的职业自尊或来自上司的压力）被迫提出更加奇特和高回报的战略，这些战略最终可能经不起时间的考验。对于我们这些量化分析师来说，记住奥卡姆剃刀原理，以及我们的工作是产生回报而不是制作巧妙的数学模型，通常是一个很难吸取的教训。
