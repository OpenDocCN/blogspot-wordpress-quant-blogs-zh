- en: that would have allowed a cram-down provision for mortgage lenders. This increases
    the value of mortgages, and so helps banks, not merely directly via their mortgages,
    but indirectly as this would have hurt home prices. The specter of Cram-Down legislation
    surely has put a drag on mortgages, though it seems there are so many Federal
    plans outstanding, it is probably too much to get worked up about defeating one
    of them. Bad mortgage fixes these days are like dandelions in my yard.

  zh: 这将允许抵押贷款人实施强制性重组。这提高了抵押贷款的价值,因此不仅直接通过他们的抵押贷款来帮助银行,还能间接帮助,因为这将损害房价。强制性重组立法的阴影无疑拖累了抵押贷款,尽管似乎还有太多联邦计划在运行,可能太多了,不值得为打败其中一个而烦恼。这些天的坏抵押贷款修复就像我院子里的蒲公英。
- en: For unsecured debt like credit cards, or accounts payable, if you declare bankruptcy
    you can then go to court, and depending on your income and assets, the judge writes
    down your debts by 50% or 100%, depending on what seems feasible. After that judgment,
    credit card and other bills are simply no longer recoverable at par, but only
    at the new, lower amount. A home loan is a secured loan, meaning, the house is
    collateral that secures the loan. When you buy a house with a mortgage, the bank
    really owns the house until the mortgage is paid. It owns it in the sense that
    if you stop paying, they take the house back, just as if you stopped paying your
    auto loan your car would be repossessed. Historically, in conjunction with a large
    downpayment and good credit checks, this led to very small mortgage lending loss
    rates. As those paying mortgages have non-recourse loans, meaning the bank can
    only repossess the house and not go after other assets, the borrower has the option
    to walk away. Adding cram down means they would also have the option of writing
    down the mortgage.

  zh: 对于无担保债务,如信用卡或应付账款,如果你申请破产,你可以然后去法院,根据你的收入和资产,法官会把你的债务减免50%或100%,这取决于什么是可行的。这项判决之后,信用卡和其他账单就再也无法全额收回,只能按新的较低金额收回。房贷是一种担保贷款,意味着房子是贷款的抵押品。当你用抵押贷款购买房子时,银行实际上是房子的所有者,直到抵押贷款还清。它拥有房子的意思是,如果你停止还款,他们将收回房子,就像你停止还汽车贷款,你的汽车会被扣押一样。历史上,结合大额首付和良好的信用审查,这导致了非常小的抵押贷款损失率。由于支付抵押贷款的借款人享有无追索权贷款,这意味着银行只能收回房子,而不能追究其他资产,因此借款人有放弃的选择。增加强制性重组意味着他们也有调整抵押贷款的选择。
- en: 'In banking, you price a loan with an expected loss build in there. This is
    basically the probability of a default times the loss in event of default: E(loss)=PD*LIED.
    Allowing borrowers to write down their homes through bankruptcy, no matter what
    your motivation, increases both the PD and the LIED. This would lead to higher
    lending rates. If you don''t believe that, then you don''t believe businesses
    try to make money, or that markets are competitive. Lender lobbyists basically
    drove this point home, that this legislation would just kill the current mortgage
    market at an especially sensitive time, and scared 12 Democrats to join the Republicans
    in opposing the Cram-Down.'

  zh: 在银行业,你给贷款定价时会预计损失。这基本上就是违约几率乘以违约时的损失:E(loss)=PD*LIED。允许借款人通过破产来减免他们的房屋,不管你的动机是什么,都会增加PD和LIED。这将导致更高的贷款利率。如果你不相信这一点,那么你就不相信企业试图赚钱,或市场是有竞争的。贷款人游说基本上说明了这一点,即这项法律将在一个特别敏感的时期扼杀目前的抵押贷款市场,并吓住了12名民主党人与共和党人一起反对强制性重组。
