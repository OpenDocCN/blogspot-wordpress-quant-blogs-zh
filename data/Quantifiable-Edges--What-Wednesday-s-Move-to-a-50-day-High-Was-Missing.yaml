- en: One notable is that that SPY closed at a 50-day high today (matching the 7/3/12
    close).  I’ve shown in the past that a new 50-day high is often more reliable
    after a period of consolidation.  In this case it has been more than 10 days since
    we last saw a 50-day closing high.  But unfortunately there is one ingredient
    that today’s new high was missing – an unfilled gap up.  The study below is from
    the Quantifiable Edge Subscriber Letter and it examines the importance of an unfilled
    upside gap.  Below I show closes at 50-day highs that occurred in conjunction
    with an unfilled gap (unlike Wednesday).

  zh: 一个值得注意的是，今天SPY收盘创50天新高（与7/3/12的收盘价持平）。我过去曾展示过，在一段时间的整理之后，新的50天高往往更可靠。在这种情况下，我们已经超过10天没有看到50天的收盘新高了。但不幸的是，今天的新高缺少了一个要素——未填补的上涨缺口。下面展示的研究来自Quantifiable
    Edge订阅信件，它探讨了未填补上涨缺口的重要性。下面我展示了与未填补缺口（与周三不同）一起发生的50天新高收盘价。
- en: Results here are strong across the board. Technicians will often use the term
    “breakaway gap”.  This suggests the gap occurs on the same day as a base breakout.
     The idea is that the new high causes excitement and the gap leaves a good amount
    of people sidelined or stuck short.  When it doesn’t immediately fill, it leads
    these people to chase and helps to propel the market even higher.

  zh: 结果显示全面强劲。技术分析师通常会使用“突破缺口”这个术语。这表明缺口发生在基地突破的同一天。这个想法是新的高点引起兴奋，而缺口留下大量的人持币观望或被套牢。如果不立即填补，它会促使这些人追逐，并帮助推动市场进一步上涨。
- en: Now let’s look at instances where the 50-day high breakout was not accompanied
    by an unfilled gap.  Interestingly, the number of instances was exactly the same.

  zh: 现在让我们看看在50天新高突破时没有伴随未填补缺口的情况。有趣的是，这种情况的实例数量完全相同。
- en: As you can see these moves to new highs that don’t start with an unfilled gap
    are much less reliable.  Unfortunately for the bull case, this is what happened
    on Wednesday.  The gap down to start the day may not have seemed like a big deal
    to most, but it means the odds of immediate follow-through are greatly diminished.

  zh: 正如你所看到的，这些没有以未填补缺口开始的新高走势要可靠得多。不幸的是，周三就是这种情况。当天开盘的跳空下跌可能对大多数人来说看起来不是什么大问题，但它意味着立即跟涨的可能性大大降低。
