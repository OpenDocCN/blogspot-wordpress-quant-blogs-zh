    from which it was derived. Bamber's insider account is interesting, but I get
    the sense that I'm missing out of both the bigger picture or what the main agents--the
    CEO's, the Fed--are doing. My neighbor used to work for AIG, and I can attest
    that he was as surprised as anyone by what happened and was buying stock the whole
    way down. If you aren't in the right place, your insider account is often rather
    barren. Cohan's book is probably the most definitive. So, I would say if you are
    really interested in this and have a lot of time, read Cohan's book. If you want
    to knock it off relatively quickly, read Kelly's.

- en: These books highlight that banks really are different than other companies.
    The actual value of Bear is never really addressed. That is, are the assets worth
    more than the liabilities? This would get into details about the nature of the
    mortgages and other assets on Bears books. No one really goes into much detail
    here. As this was the key question, I was rather surprised that Bear did not have
    a standard template for explaining why they thought their mortgage assets--with
    a book value of $46B--were really worth that much. In the final hours, outside
    firms really had no way to value these assets with much confidence. Bear should
    have been able to slice a book sixteen different ways, by the vintage, FICO, LTV,
    and other dimensions of the collateral, look at how various securities are in
    the waterfall of the tranches. They should have had clear reference securities
    for benchmarking their valuation. For this reason, I don't really feel sorry for
    Bear. This was a major managerial failure.

  zh: 这些书强调银行确实与其他公司不同。熊猫的实际价值从未真正得到解决。也就是说，资产是否价值高于负债？这将涉及到熊猫账簿上抵押贷款和其他资产性质的细节。在这里，没有人真正深入讨论。由于这是一个关键问题，我对于熊猫没有一个解释他们为什么认为他们的抵押贷款资产——价值460亿美元的账面价值——真的那么值钱的标准模板感到相当惊讶。在最后的时刻，外部公司实际上没有办法以很大的信心对这些资产进行估值。熊猫应该能够通过按抵押贷款的年份、FICO、贷款价值比（LTV）和其他抵押品维度将一个账簿切割成十六个不同的部分，查看各种证券在信贷分级的流程中的位置。他们应该有清晰的参考证券来对他们的估值进行基准测试。出于这个原因，我对熊猫并不感到抱歉。这是一个重大的管理失误。
- en: In the summer of 2007, two of their hedge funds collapsed, going from being
    up a few percent, to being wiped out in merely a month. They had write downs throughout
    2007 related to mortgage securities, and people were wondering if that was just
    the beginning. The week prior to Bear's demise, Renaissance, the huge hedge fund,
    pulled its money from its prime brokerage at Bear, and a large hedge fund can't
    do this without everyone knowing about it. Then, on Wednesday Goldman decided
    it did not accept Bear as a counterparty on some derivatives, and this was mentioned
    in an interview by Marc Faber on CNBC with CEO Alan Schwartz. While Goldman reversed
    their position the following day, this decision exacerbated the run as most hedge
    funds were pulling their money out of their Bear prime brokerage accounts. Why
    Goldman and Renaissance did this is really the big question that none of the books
    address, and given the importance of this event in the destruction of Bear, I
    imagine that is a story that will never be told because of legal liability. That
    is, if you say too much, a lawyer could argue the actions were damaging and contained
    bad faith bargaining, In any case once the run started the whole solvency question
    was rather moot, because if everyone is concerned that others are not rolling
    their debt over, they won't roll over Bear's debt, create a self-fulfilling prophesy.
    If Bear has 50 counterparties, but each thinks they other's are pulling their
    money out, then Bear will go bankrupt irrespective of its solvency. This is the
    nature of a bank run. Once it starts, it is very hard to stop. FDIC insurance
    stops most retail runs, but for banks dependent on short term financing, runs
    remain [see

  zh: 2007年夏天，他们的两只对冲基金崩溃了，从涨了几个百分点到仅仅一个月就被清零。他们在2007年整年都在面临与抵押证券相关的减记，人们开始怀疑这是否只是开始。在熊猫（Bear）崩溃前一周，巨大的对冲基金文艺复兴（Renaissance）从熊猫的主要经纪人处提取了资金，一个大型对冲基金不能做到这一点而不让所有人都知道。然后，在周三，高盛决定不接受熊猫某些衍生品的反方作为交易对手，并在马克·法伯（Marc
    Faber）在CNBC与首席执行官艾伦·施瓦茨（Alan Schwartz）的采访中提到了这一点。尽管高盛在第二天撤销了他们的立场，但这个决定加剧了对冲基金从他们的熊猫主要经纪账户提取资金的局面。为什么高盛和文艺复兴这样做，这实际上是一个很大的问题，没有一本书涉及到，鉴于这一事件对熊猫的破坏性作用，我想这是一个永远不会被告知的故事，因为法律责任。也就是说，如果你说得太多，律师可以辩称这些行为是有害的，并包含了不诚信的讨价还价。无论如何，一旦开始了运行，整个偿付能力问题就不那么重要了，因为如果每个人都担心其他人不会滚动他们的债务，他们就不会滚动熊猫的债务，从而造成了一个自我实现的预言。如果熊猫有50个交易对手，但每个人都认为其他人正在提取他们的资金，那么熊猫将破产，而与其偿付能力无关。这就是银行挤兑的本质。一旦开始，就很难停止。FDIC保险阻止了大多数零售挤兑，但对于依赖短期融资的银行来说，挤兑仍然存在[见

- en: The thing about short term money is that one's credit quality has to be beyond
    question. Moving to BBB in your debt rating is basically a death sentence for
    such a firm, and a BBB rated company has only a 0.15% probability of default,
    so as a practical matter it is very difficult to say whether a company should
    be rated A (0.07% annualized default rate) or BBB. So, it's very tricky, which
    is why there is all this concern about trust, and keeping out of the gossip pages.
    You want bankers who are squeaky clean, and the pot-smoking rumors about 72 year-old
    ex-CEO Jimmy Cayne surely didn't help, though personally I don't see the relevance.

  zh: 短期资金的问题在于一个人的信用质量必须是毋庸置疑的。将债务评级降至BBB基本上是对这样一家公司的死刑，而BBB级公司只有0.15%的违约概率，因此从实际角度来看，很难说一家公司是否应该被评为A级（年化违约率为0.07%）还是BBB级。所以，这非常棘手，这就是为什么有这么多关于信任的担忧，以及避免出现在八卦版上的原因。你想要的是银行家们都一尘不染，而关于72岁的前首席执行官吉米·凯恩吸毒的传闻肯定没有帮助，尽管我个人认为这与此无关。

    that way, they are like Merton and Scholes in the LTCM failure--irrelevant. Those
    making the key decisions, making the key arguments, were the simple business managers:
    Alan Schwartz, a broker by training, head of Fixed Income Warren Spector, the
    Treasurer Bob Upton, and CFO Sam Molinaro. Indeed, Kelly writes "managers in places
    like risk management and operations were considered less important to the firm''s
    core franchise and therefore largely excluded from important decisions." Risk
    Management lumped with operations. Ouch.'

- en: An interesting point is to what degree the hedge funds really drove this. If
    all the hedge funds were pulling their prime brokerage accounts, this could have
    driven the bankruptcy by itself. As hedge funds are greedy little companies like
    any other, the implications of their actions would clearly suggest that hedging
    their risk, or profiting from their predicament, would be a good trade. Thus,
    selling Bear stock and buying default protection on Bear, would drive down Bear's
    credit rating, exacerbating their problem, making more money for the hedge funds
    all the way down. For a big hedge fund like Renaissance, they must have know the
    implications of their actions, and it clearly suggested shorting Bear as a strategy.
    Some funds, like Citadel, seemed ready to step in and buy Bear, but as there were
    rumors of a bear run by hedge funds this was basically never considered by Bear,
    and only JPMorgan, custodian for Bear's assets, had the wherewithal to quickly
    review Bear's assets in time to generate a buyout bid.

  zh: 一个有趣的点是对冲基金真正推动了多大程度上的这场灾难。如果所有对冲基金都撤出他们的首席经纪业务账户，这本身就可能导致破产。由于对冲基金和其他公司一样贪婪，他们行动的含义显然表明，对冲他们的风险，或者从他们的困境中获利，都是一笔不错的买卖。因此，出售贝尔股票并购买贝尔的违约保护，会降低贝尔的信用评级，加剧他们的问题，为对冲基金带来更多的利润。对于像文艺复兴这样的大型对冲基金来说，他们一定知道他们行动的后果，而且显然建议做空贝尔是一个策略。一些基金，如城堡基金，似乎准备介入并购买贝尔，但由于有关对冲基金熊市传闻的传闻，这基本上从未被贝尔考虑过，只有摩根大通，负责贝尔资产的托管人，有能力及时审查贝尔的资产以生成收购要约。
