- en: I was not at all surprised that when the [VIX spiked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    over 80 last October, this blog was the beneficiary of a similar spike in readership.
    In fact, spikes in visitors to the blog have been highly correlated with the VIX
    and with various volatility events since the blog was launched in January 2007\.
    This phenomenon is not limited to *VIX and More*. As a general principle, readership
    of all sources of financial information tends to increase whenever investor anxiety
    is heightened and the need for quality information and insight is greatest.

  zh: 当[VIX在去年10月超过80](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)时，我一点也不惊讶，这个博客读者量也出现了类似的激增。事实上，自2007年1月博客成立以来，访问博客的访客量与VIX和各种波动率事件高度相关。这种现象并不仅限于*VIX
    and More*。作为一个一般原则，每当投资者焦虑加剧，对高质量信息和洞见的最大需求时，所有金融信息来源的读者量都会增加。
- en: What has surprised me, however, is the magnitude of the persistent interest
    in the VIX in recent weeks, not to mention the debate caused by the drop in the
    VIX below the 30 level. Clearly, the VIX is not a one-spike pony and investors
    have become highly attuned to a more complex dialogue about volatility levels
    and their implications. This point was brought home dramatically last month when
    the blog’s readership hit a new high, eclipsing the VIX moon shot mania of October.
    In the chart below, I have noted the events which have triggered readership to
    spike above the long-term trend line. As best as I can tell, last month was the
    first time readership spiked due to concerns about how *low* the VIX is.

  zh: 然而，让我感到惊讶的是，最近几周对VIX的持续关注度之高，更不用说VIX跌破30点所引起的争议了。显然，VIX并非是一匹一次性的脉冲马，投资者已经高度关注关于波动率水平和它们含义的更复杂对话。上月，博客的读者量达到新的高峰，超过了去年10月的VIX疯狂追捧。在下面的图表中，我注明了引发读者量突破长期趋势线的事件。据我所知，上月是读者量因为对VIX*低位*的担忧而激增的第一次。
- en: Apparently, the VIX is here to stay. And while I enjoy probing the “…and More”
    portion of my blogging calling card, I will see what I can do to at least match
    the volume of VIX posts by the irrepressible Adam Warner at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/).

  zh: 显然，VIX是来势汹汹，并将持续存在。尽管我很喜欢探索我的博客名片的“…以及更多”部分，但我会尽力至少与Adam Warner在[每日期权报告](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)上关于VIX的文章数量相匹配。
