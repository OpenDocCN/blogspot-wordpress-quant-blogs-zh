    modeling. Though they also have lots of publications, their prizes are generally
    for something insanely parochial. Stiglitz, Scholes, McFadden, all made such contributions.
    Their knowledge of the mortgage crisis is therefore predictably unenlightening

  zh: 诺贝尔奖通常颁发给一些相当显著的、非常特别的建模。他们也有很多出版物，但他们的奖通常是为了某种令人难以置信的偏执意义。因此，斯蒂格利茨、斯科利斯、麦克法登，都做出了这样的贡献。因此，他们对抵押贷款危机的了解可预见地并没有太多启发性

- en: Scholes doesn't really say much in specific, though he highlights that risk
    is primarily the extreme events, not the average variability, especially in periods
    where everyone is trying to get out of a trade at the same time. In other words,
    he still has nightmares about LTCM foundering on an extreme event, where everyone
    knew LTCM's huge positions, and basically would not let them out at a price they
    could afford. Scholes did emphasize the costs of regulation, but did not have
    many specifics in regard to mortgages.

  zh: 斯科利斯并没有详细说什么，尽管他强调风险主要来自极端事件，而不是平均可变性，尤其是在每个人都试图同时退出交易的时期。换句话说，他仍然对LTCM在一个极端事件上遭遇困难的事情感到恐惧，当时每个人都知道LTCM的巨额头寸，基本上不会以他们能承受的价格让他们退出。斯科利斯确实强调了监管的成本，但并没有太多关于抵押贷款的具体细节。
- en: Stiglitz just mentions more regulation is needed, noting that as the decline
    in income relative to trend, if you assume a unit root process for GDP, is about
    $1.5 trillion. Clearly, that implies a couple hundred billion on regulation is
    no big deal. But this presumes the money would be spent wisely. What were the
    regulators of the mortgage market focused on in 2006, prior to this crisis being
    created? They were not focused on underwriting standards. Indeed, the government

    nipped this in the bud. Otherwise, they would have been like Taleb, focusing on

  zh: 为了增加房屋所有权，主要是为了少数族裔，而放松了核保标准。只有后见之明，人们才会认为监管机构本该将此消灭在摇篮中。否则，他们就会像塔利布一样，注重利率风险，或者其他可能出问题但实际没问题的东西。
- en: Stiglitz betrays his bias by making the inconsistent point that all these poor
    people now lost their homes. But the problem was, they could not afford these
    homes. These are no-recourse loans, so they walk away, and the lenders have the
    loss. If one thinks lending was overdone, then these borrowers lost houses they
    should not have had anyway, and should not keep them. But Stiglitz is an economic
    redistributionist, in that he has a tendency to confabulate any rationale that
    effectively transfers wealth directly to the poor, or away from the rich.

  zh: 斯蒂格利茨出卖了他的偏见，因为他指出了这一矛盾的观点：这些贫穷的人现在失去了他们的房子。但问题是，他们买不起这些房子。这些是无追索权贷款，所以他们就走了，损失由贷款人承担。如果一个人认为贷款过度了，那么这些借款人失去了他们本不应该拥有的房子，也不应该保留它们。但斯蒂格利茨是经济再分配主义者，他有一种把财富直接转移到穷人手中或者从富人手中转移的倾向。
- en: And then there's McFadden, who notes the precautionary principle, and asks that
    regulators adopt the approach of our drug regulators, to first prove an innovation
    does no harm. Of course, this is the regulation that would make aspirin a perscription
    drug if it were discovered today, and contains myriad warnings on every drug that
    serve only to cover their behinds, because it buries any important information
    in the page of 8-pt font outlining the things subjects reported (nausea, light
    headedness). That these guys have zero upside, and only downside, does not make
    for a social optimum.

  zh: 然后是麦克法登，他指出了预防原则，并要求监管机构采用我们的药品监管机构所采用的方法，首先证明一项创新不会造成伤害。当然，如果今天才发现阿司匹林，那么它将是处方药，并且在每种药品上都包含了无数的警告，只为了保护自己，因为它们将任何重要信息都埋在了8磅字体的页面里，列出了受试者报告的事项（恶心、头晕）。这些家伙没有任何上升空间，只有下降空间，并不构成社会最佳选择。
- en: The productivity trend that Stiglitz takes for granted is predicated on lots
    of little innovation happening all the time. Innovation would be greatly diminished
    if it had to pass the precautionary principle. Better to accept these risks, rather
    than to get rid of these risks at the cost of zero growth.

  zh: 斯蒂格利茨所认为的生产率趋势是基于一直在发生的许多小创新。如果创新必须遵循预防原则，创新将大大减少。 与其为了摆脱这些风险而付出零增长的代价，不如接受这些风险。
- en: I think their were many forces underlying this crisis, but the key mistake was
    the change in underwriting criteria (no money down, no income verification, reverse
    amortization loans). The rating agencies, I think, were the weak link, because
    if something is rated AAA, I really can't blame risk management for not appreciating
    the probability this paper would, in aggregate, lose 50% of its value, because
    it is unprecendented. Once you start asking risk managers to apply unprecedented
    scenarios, then everything stops, because there are an infinite number of unprecedented
    adverse scenarios. The fall guy, therefore, should be agencies that did not adjust
    their models in light of these changes.

  zh: 我认为这次危机下面有许多推动力量，但关键错误是担保标准的改变（无需首付、无需收入验证、反摊销贷款）。我认为评级机构是软肋，因为如果某物品被评为AAA级，我实在不能责怪风险管理部门未能意识到这种证券整体而言有可能损失50%的价值的概率，因为这是史无前例的。一旦你开始要求风险管理者应对史无前例的情况，那么一切都会停滞，因为史无前例的不利情况有无穷无尽个。因此，替罪羊应当是那些没有根据这些变化调整他们的模型的机构。
