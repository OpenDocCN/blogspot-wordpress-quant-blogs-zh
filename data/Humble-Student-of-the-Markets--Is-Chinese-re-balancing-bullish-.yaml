- en: '***Now close to 50 percent of GDP, this paper assesses the appropriateness
    of China’s current investment levels.*** It finds that China’s capital-to-output
    ratio is within the range of other emerging markets, but its economic growth rates
    stand out, partly due to a surge in investment over the last decade. Moreover,
    its investment is significantly higher than suggested by cross-country panel estimation.
    This deviation has been accumulating over the last decade, and at nearly 10 percent
    of GDP is now larger and more persistent than experienced by other Asian economies
    leading up to the Asian crisis. However, because its investment is predominantly
    financed by domestic savings, a crisis appears unlikely when assessed against
    dependency on external funding. But this does not mean that the cost is absent.
    Rather, ***it is distributed to other sectors of the economy through a hidden
    transfer of resources, estimated at an average of 4 percent of GDP per year***.'

- en: One of the implications of the study is that households and SMEs have been forced
    to subsidize growth at a cost to them of well over 4% of GDP annually. My own
    back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the cost to households is actually
    5-8% of GDP – perhaps because I also include the implicit subsidy to recapitalize
    the banks in the form of the excess spread between the lending and deposit rates
    – but certainly I agree with the IMF study that this has been a massive transfer
    to subsidize growth.

  zh: 研究的一个含义是，家庭和中小企业被迫补贴增长，对他们来说，成本超过每年GDP的4%。我自己的粗略计算表明，对家庭的成本实际上占GDP的5-8%——也许是因为我还包括银行资本重组的隐性补贴，即贷款利率和存款利率之间的超额利差——但无疑我同意IMF研究认为这已经是一个巨大的补贴增长转移。

- en: But let us...give China five years to bring investment down to 40% of GDP from
    its current level of 50%. Chinese investment must grow at a much lower rate than
    GDP for this to happen. How much lower? The arithmetic is simple. It depends on
    what we assume GDP growth will be over the next five years, but investment has
    to grow by roughly 4.5 percentage points or more below the GDP growth rate for
    this condition to be met.

    2.3%. If China grows at 5%, investment must grow at 0.4%. And if China grows at
    3%, which is much closer to my ten-year view, investment growth must actually
    contract by 1.5%. Only in this way will investment drop by ten percentage points

    side, it probably needs nonetheless to be spelled out. ***Any meaningful rebalancing
