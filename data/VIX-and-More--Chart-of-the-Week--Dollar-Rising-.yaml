- en: Friday was a reminder that the [dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar)
    will not go down every single day in an orderly, straight line fashion. In fact,
    there will be days when the dollar reverses sharply and sends traders who are
    short the currency scrambling to cover their positions, as was the case with Friday’s
    1.44% gain.

  zh: 周五提醒我们，美元不会每天以有序、直线的方式下跌。实际上，会有美元大幅逆转的日子，让做空货币的交易员急于平仓，就像周五的1.44%的涨幅一样。
- en: In this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, I track the fall of the dollar and simultaneous rise in the S&P 500 index
    that began during the first week in March. Since that time there has been only
    one day in which the dollar gained more than 1.44%. I have highlighted that day
    with blue arrows to underscore that while the prior large move in the dollar did
    precede a two week bounce in the currency and a four week selloff in stocks, it
    did not affect the underlying trend in either the dollar or stocks.

  zh: 在本文下面的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)中，我追踪了自三月初开始的美元下跌和标普500指数的同步上涨。自那时以来，只有的一天美元涨幅超过了1.44%。我用蓝色箭头标出了那一天，以强调尽管美元之前的大幅波动确实预示着货币的两周反弹和股票的四周下跌，但它并没有改变美元或股票的基本趋势。
- en: Of course it could be different this time around. For starters, the dollar closed
    above the 50 day moving average for the first time since mid-April. From a technical
    perspective, however, I would not tend to get excited about Friday’s rally until
    it leads to a higher high above 77 and a higher low above 75\. For now at least,
    the current rally should be treated as just another opportunity for some new shorts
    to join the dollar carry trade party.

  zh: 当然，这次可能会有所不同。首先，美元收盘价自四月中旬以来首次突破50日均线。从技术角度来看，然而，我并不会对周五的上涨感到兴奋，除非它导致高于77的高点和高于75的低点。至少目前，当前的上涨应该被视为新空头加入美元套利交易派对的一个新的机会。
