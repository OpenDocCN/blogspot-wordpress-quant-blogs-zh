    have often said that these markets offer a better prediction of election outcomes
    than opinion polls, sometimes claiming that they beat polls three-quarters of
    the time. I have been an avid participant in these markets, but I would like to
    offer a contrarian view: I believe that these markets often follow, rather than
    predict, events. The so-called “predictability” of these markets is often ill-defined.
    The prediction changes constantly over time, and so depending on when you take
    a snapshot of the markets, you can always find an instant when, retrospectively,
    the prediction matches the actual election outcomes very closely.'

  zh: （总部位于爱尔兰的）是最受欢迎的一个。）媒体评论家和学者们经常说，这些市场提供的选举结果预测比民意调查更好，有时声称它们有四分之三的时间胜过民意调查。我一直积极参与这些市场，但我想要提供一个相反的观点：我相信这些市场往往是跟随事件而不是预测事件。这些市场所谓的“可预测性”往往是定义不清的。预测随着时间的推移而不断变化，所以当你对市场进行快照时，你总能找到一个时刻，回顾起来，预测与实际的选举结果非常接近。
- en: As an example, I watched with amusement the tradesports.com futures market prediction
    of the Virginia Senate race between Democrat Jim Webb and Republican George Allen.
    This is one of the two close races that will determine the control of the Senate.
    For months, the market predicts that the Democrat will lose (the probability of
    winning, which is the same as the price divided by 100, is always below 50% until
    the beginning of November). Then in November, the market began to see the light,
    and started to predict a Democratic win. See the chart below.

  zh: 例如，我饶有兴趣地观察了tradesports.com对弗吉尼亚州参议员选举的期货市场预测，这场选举是民主党人吉姆·韦伯和共和党人乔治·艾伦之间的竞争。这是将决定参议院控制权的两场接近的选举之一。几个月来，市场一直预测民主党将失败（获胜的概率，与价格除以100相同，始终低于50%，直到11月初）。然后，在11月，市场开始看到曙光，并开始预测民主党将获胜。请看下面的图表。

- en: As the vote counts started to be released, the market first thought the Republican
    was going to win, driving the prices down to the teens. That was due to the votes
    from the conservative southern Virginia, which were the first to come in. Then,
    as the vote counts from the more liberal northern Virginia were published at around
    11:30 pm, the prices shot up to above $60, and continued on to over $80\. Clearly,
    the market does not know more about the future than your average news anchor.

  zh: 当计票开始公布时，市场最初认为共和党将会赢，导致价格跌至十几美元。这是由于来自保守的南部弗吉尼亚的选票最早公布。然后，在大约晚上11:30，当来自更自由的北部弗吉尼亚的选票公布时，价格飙升超过60美元，并继续升至80美元以上。显然，市场并不比普通的新闻主播知道更多关于未来的信息。
- en: As someone interested in the predictability of election outcomes based on futures
    markets, this raises a serious question. What is the proper time to take a snapshot
    of the market? Should it be 1 month before the election (in which case this market
    prediction failed, presuming a Democratic win after the recount)? Or should it
    be 1 week before the election, in which case this market prediction succeeded?
    And without an answer to this question, how can one claim whether the prediction
    is accurate or inaccurate?

  zh: 作为一名对基于期货市场的选举结果可预测性感兴趣的人，这引发了一个严重的问题。什么是获取市场快照的正确时间？是在选举前1个月（在这种情况下市场预测失败，假设重新计票后民主党获胜）？还是应该在选举前1周，在这种情况下市场预测成功？如果没有答案，那么如何声称预测是准确还是不准确呢？
