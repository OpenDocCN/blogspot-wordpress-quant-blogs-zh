- en: The liberal ideas that gave rise to the Enlightenment are generally thought
    (eg, Steven Pinker) to be a break from a religious thinking. Yet the key liberal
    idea, individual rights, especially property rights, are an axiom with little
    justification outside Christian theology. As Feynman noted with regards to scientific
    laws, the process of finding new ones is not deriving them via logic, but rather,
    guessing, and then looking at the consequences. History has shown that individual
    property rights are good. Friedrich Hayek noted that a universal morality is beyond
    human knowledge, in that prior to markets actually existing--say, while we were
    hunter-gatherers--one would never have predicted free markets are better than
    socialism. Individual property rights are one of those moral principles that were
    discovered outside of pure reason.

- en: Historically the King supposedly represented the people, and what he wants necessarily
    is what his people need. It's the original conflation of the state and society.
    The idea that a regular individual can seek his own self-interest and simultaneously
    be optimally working for society seems absurd, in that clearly there are many
    evil people who have no interest in bettering society. The idea that the state
    should ultimately own everything is an ancient idea, and private property highly
    non-intuitive idea, why it took so long to develop.

  zh: 历史上，国王据说代表人民，他想要的一定是他的人民需要的。这是国家和社会最开始的混淆。普通人追求自身利益的同时也能为社会作出最优贡献这种想法似乎是荒谬的，因为显然有很多恶人对改善社会没有任何兴趣。国家最终拥有一切的想法是古老的想法，而私人财产是一个非常难以理解的想法，为什么花了这么长时间才发展起来。
- en: Roman law recognized private property belonging to individuals, but with a large
    caveat. For example, Cicero (106-43 BCE) wrote that "I do not mean to find fault
    with the accumulation of property, provided it hurts nobody, but unjust acquisition
    of it is always to be avoided." With this little exception many rulers could capriciously
    expropriate, in the same way there is a right to free speech in Cuba as long as
    it is "in keeping with the objectives of socialist society." Roman emperors viewed
    private associations like guilds as having the right to property, but these had
    to be founded with state authority and were closely regulated.

  zh: 罗马法认识到个人位属私人财产，但有一个很大的例外。例如，西塞罗（公元前106-43年）写道：“我并不是要指责财富的积累，只要它不伤害任何人，但无论如何都应该避免不义之财。”除了这个小例外外，许多统治者可以任意征用，就像古巴有言论自由一样，只要它符合“社会主义社会的目标”。罗马皇帝认为类似行会的私人协会有财产权，但必须要在国家的授权下成立，而且受到严格的监管。
- en: St. Augustine (354-430 CE) noted that reason is insufficient to motivate a truly
    Good Will. The will has reasons outside of reason, and is essential for being
    'good,' so the individual is primary, his relation to anyone else secondary. 
    In 1140 Gratian wrote the Decretum, a collection of Canon law as a legal textbook.
    It argued that natural law of men created in the image of God is the Golden Rule.
    "Natural law is what is contained in the law and the Gospel. By it, each person
    is commanded to do to others what he wants done to himself and is prohibited from
    inflicting on others what he does not want done to himself." Gratian's identification
    of natural law with the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) departs from the definition
    in Justinian's civil code (529 CE), which defines that natural law is what “nature
    teaches all animals.”

  zh: 圣奥古斯丁（354-430年）指出，理性是不足以激励真正的善意的意愿。意志在理性之外还有理由，并且对于‘善’来说是至关重要的，因此个体是首要的，与其他人的关系次要。
    在1140年，格拉提安写了《法典》，这是一本法学教科书。它认为上帝照着自己的形象创造的人类的自然法是黄金法则。“自然法就是圣经和福音中所包含的。吩咐每个人对待他人，如同自己想要对待自己一样，并禁止他对他人施以其不愿意施于自己的事情。”
    格拉提安将自然法和黄金法则（马太福音7:12）的定义与查士丁尼公元529年的民法作的定义相分离，查士丁尼公元529年的法明确规定自然法是“自然教导动物的东西”。
- en: Franciscan friar Duns Scotus (1266-1308) argued that morality needs freedom
    because without freedom, a person cannot do anything praiseworthy; without freedom
    actions do not represent the will, so are morally neutral. Fellow friar William
    of Ockham’s (1285-1347) writings on natural law are significant for the ideas
    of both individual rights and consent to government. Defending his Franciscan
    order against papal criticisms of their teachings on spiritual poverty, he distinguished
    among the various meanings of the Latin word jus (law, right) and dominium (rule,
    property) to defend an individual right to property. Ockham's emphasis on faith
    and freedom countered Thomas Aquinas's rationalist account of natural law. Rights,
    liberty, were paramount, and these put limits on the power of rulers.

  zh: 方济各会修士邓斯·司各特（1266-1308）认为道德需要自由，因为没有自由，一个人无法做出值得赞扬的事情；没有自由，行动就不代表意愿，因此在道德上是中立的。
    同僚威廉·奥卡姆（1285-1347）关于自然法的著作对于个体权利和对政府的同意的观念都是重要的。他为了捍卫方济各会修士的教义而对教皇对他们关于精神贫困的教义的批评作出区分，他区分了拉丁词‘法’（法律，权利）和‘主权’（统治，财产）的各种含义以辩护个体对财产的权利。奥卡姆对信仰和自由的强调对抗了托马斯·阿奎那对自然法的理性主义观点。
    权利，自由是首要的，这些对统治者的权力施加了限制。
- en: 'These ideas define the central concepts of liberal constitutional theory: individual
    rights, freedom, equality, limited government, popular sovereignty, consent to
    law and government, and the right of the people to resist tyrannical rulers. Hugo
    Grotius (1583-1645) was a Dutch jurist and argued that nature was not an entity
    in itself, but God''s creation. Samuel Pufendorf (1632-1694) relied on Grotius
    to argue that the state is nothing more than the sum of the individual wills that
    are associated within it, and hence the state needs to submit to a discipline
    essential for human safety. In this view, the state is a subordinate claimant
    on the individual, behind the individual''s prerogative, who then has the free
    will to sin or not.'

  zh: 这些观点定义了自由宪法理论的核心概念：个体权利、自由、平等、有限政府、人民主权、法律和政府的同意，以及人民抵制暴政的权利。雨果·格罗迪乌斯（1583-1645）是荷兰法学家，他认为自然并不是一个实体，而是上帝的创造。
    萨缪尔·普芬多夫（1632-1694）依赖于格罗提安的观点，认为国家不过是其中涉及的个体意愿的总和，因此国家需要服从于对于人类安全至关重要的纪律。在这一观点中，国家是个体的从属要求，个体的决定权高于国家，然后有自由意志去犯错或不去犯错。
- en: Finally, John Locke (1632-1704) also thought natural law was the same as biblical
    revelation, both originated from God. Thus, the Euthyphro dilemma "is what is
    morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good
    because it is commanded by God?" is no dilemma because God wrote his moral code
    on our heart, and his commands are natural law as well if we care to discover
    them via trial and error. The preeminence of property for Locke is clear when
    he writes the 'great and chief end of a commonwealth, and putting themselves under
    government, is the preservation of their property.'

  zh: 最后，约翰·洛克（1632-1704）也认为自然法与《圣经》启示相同，都源自上帝。因此，尤菲羅困境“道德上的善是因为上帝命令而被命令的，还是因为上帝命令而道德上的善？”并不是一个困境，因为上帝将他的道德规范写在我们的心上，如果我们愿意通过试错来发现，他的命令也是自然法。
    洛克对财产的首要地位是清楚的，当他写道“一个国家的最伟大和主要目的，是保护他们的财产并把自己置于政府之下。”
- en: 'When the US Framers of the Constitution refer to individual property rights
    they almost always spoke in overtly religious terms. For example, John Adams wrote
    "If  ''Thou shalt not covet,'' and ''Thou shalt not steal,'' were not commandments
    of heaven, they must be made inviolable precepts in every society before it can
    be civilized or made free." This makes sense because at some level a right like
    cannot be proven, and so like religion takes a bit of faith.  Rights are like
    duties, in that they constrain other objectives irrespective of their utilitarian
    benefits: it is presumed they serve some transcendent or long-term benefit, one
    that cannot be proven but is rather inferred based on an ideology about the way
    the universe works.'

  zh: 当美国宪法的制定者们谈到个人财产权时，他们几乎总是以明显的宗教术语说话。例如，约翰·亚当斯写道：“如果‘不可贪婪’和‘不可偷窃’不是天堂的诫命，它们必须成为每个社会中不容违背的准则，方可文明化或者自由。”这是有道理的，因为在某种程度上，像这样的权利无法被证明，所以和宗教一样需要一点信仰。权利就像义务一样，它们限制其他目标，无论其功利性利益如何：据推测，它们服务于一些超然或长远的利益，这些利益无法被证明，而是基于有关整个宇宙运行方式的意识形态而被推论出来的。
