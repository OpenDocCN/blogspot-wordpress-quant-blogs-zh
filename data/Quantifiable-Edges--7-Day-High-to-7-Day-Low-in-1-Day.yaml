    closed at a 7-day low.  Way back in

    results below and also incorporated a 200-day moving average filter.

- en: There appears to be a bit of a downside edge over the next few days, and much
    of that edge has played out during days one and two.  Perhaps the quick move through
    7 days of resistance causes weak hands to bail and further selling to ensue.

  zh: 在未来几天似乎有点下行趋势，而其中的大部分趋势在第一天和第二天已经实现。或许在7天的阻力位迅速突破导致持币不坚定的人离场，进一步的卖出随之而来。
- en: It will be interesting to see how it plays out today because it appears SPY
    may have a large gap up when the market opens in about an hour.  Gaps up from
    low areas are less likely to fill, leaving shorts stuck and chasing the markets
    upwards.  If the gap can hold, then we may avoid the further selling suggested
    by the study.  If the gap up fills, then the move lower could quickly accelerate.

  zh: 今天它如何表现将会很有趣，因为看起来SPY在市场开盘前大约一个小时可能会有一个大的跳空高开。从低位跳空高开不太可能回补，使得空头被困并追逐市场上涨。如果跳空能够保持，那么我们可能避免进一步卖出研究所暗示的情况。如果跳空高开被回补，那么下跌可能会迅速加速。
