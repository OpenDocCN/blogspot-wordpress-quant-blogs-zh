    high, though another five topped out within 2% of the punch level, before making
    a retracement that went at least back below the punch level and ranged in size
    from 3% to 21%. The exception was in June 1997 which went into an eight day upper
    band ride that ran up 80 points before retracing 70 points. ***This is a fairly
    bearish history, with one strong exception***.

- en: Any way we slice and dice it, stocks aren’t cheap. At best, they are fairly
    valued. Of course, the bears say that they are grossly overvalued because they
    are expecting a recession. In their opinion, the problem is that earnings are
    at a record high and so are profit margins. So these two are increasingly likely
    to go down rather than up.

    overvaluation problem because they are based on analysts’ consensus expectations
    for earnings that are too optimistic. That’s true if a recession is coming soon.
    I don’t see one coming soon, so I don’t have a problem using forward P/Es for
    assessing valuation. Nevertheless, there is a valuation problem, though it isn’t
    as extreme as the bears say it is.
