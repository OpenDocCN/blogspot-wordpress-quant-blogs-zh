- en: Technical analysts monitor market breadth, as the theory goes, to see the underlying
    tone of the market. If the major market averages are rising, but breadth indicators
    are not confirming the advance, this can be described as the generals leading
    the charge, but the troops are not following. Such negative divergences are signs
    of technical weakness that may be a precursor to future market weakness.

  zh: 技术分析师监控市场宽度，理论上是想了解市场的潜在基调。如果主要的市场平均数在上升，但宽度指标没有确认这一上涨，这可以描述为将领冲锋在前，但士兵并未跟上。这样的负面分歧是技术弱势的迹象，可能是未来市场弱势的前兆。

- en: I have been highly skeptical of breadth indicators as a technical analysis tool
    because breadth divergences can take a long time for the market to resolve, if
    at all. The chart below shows the SPX, the “generals”, along with several indicators
    of how the “troops” are behaving, namely the mid-cap and small cap indices, as
    well as the the NYSE Advance-Decline Line.

  zh: 我一直对将宽度指标作为技术分析工具持高度怀疑态度，因为市场要解决宽度分歧可能需要很长时间，甚至可能永远解决不了。下面的图表展示了标普500指数（“将领”）以及几个显示“士兵”行为表现的指标，即中盘和小盘指数，还有纽约证券交易所的涨跌线。
- en: The behaviour of these indicators during and after the Tech Bubble was problematical.
    During the advance from 1998 to 2000, the NYSE A-D Line fell and flashed a negative
    divergence sell signal. At the same time, both the mid- and small-cap indices
    continued to rise and confirmed the market advance. Which divergence should investors
    believe?

  zh: 这些指标在科技泡沫期间及其后的表现是有问题的。从1998年到2000年的上涨期间，纽约证券交易所的涨跌线下跌，并闪烁着负分歧的卖出信号。与此同时，中盘和小盘指数继续上涨，确认了市场的上涨。投资者应该相信哪个分歧？
- en: After the market peaked in 2000, the mid and small caps traded sideways, which
    represented a non-confirmation of the bear market. Investors who followed this
    buy signal would have seen significant drawdowns during this bear market.

  zh: 在2000年市场达到顶峰后，中盘和小盘指数交易持平，这代表了熊市的不确认。在熊市期间，跟随这个买入信号的投资者将看到显著的跌幅。
- en: To be sure, there were periods when breadth indicators worked. The NYSE A-D
    Line traded sideways during the market decline of 2011, which was a buy signal.
    As well, it correctly warned of market weakness in 2015.

  zh: 当然，有些时期宽度指标是有效的。在2011年市场下跌期间，纽约证券交易所的涨跌线交易持平，这是一个买入信号。同样，它在2015年正确地警告了市场弱势。
- en: Putting it all together, the report card for these indicators can best be described
    as inconsistent and the timing of the signal uncertain. At a minimum, no investor
    would use breadth indicators in a trading system.

  zh: 将这些指标综合起来，这些指标的评估结果最好描述为不一致，信号时机的确定性也不高。至少，没有投资者会在交易系统中使用宽度指标。
