- en: For the bulls, I can suggest looking at Homebuilders and Gold miners. The Homebuilding
    group has been on a tear since last October. Gold stocks have been rallying presumably
    on the assumption that the latest round of global quantitative easing by central
    bankers amount to competitive devaluation and gold bullion is a beneficiary because
    of its status as an alternative currency.

  zh: 对于多头，我建议可以关注住宅建筑商和黄金矿工。住宅建筑群体自去年十月以来一直表现强劲。黄金股票的上涨可能是基于这样一个假设：央行最新一轮的全球量化宽松相当于竞争性贬值，而黄金因其作为替代货币的地位而成为受益者。
- en: The bears might want to consider the high yielding Telecom sector and Health
    Care for their defensive qualities. Telecom stocks have been beating the stock
    market since May, which makes it an ideal candidate for investment regardless
    of market climate. Health Care has shown itself to be the leadership in this current
    sideways consolidation period and would likely outperform should stocks decline
    further.

  zh: 空头可能要考虑具有防御性的电信板块和医疗保健板块。电信股票自五月以来一直超越股市，使其成为无论市场气候如何都是一个理想的投资对象。医疗保健已经显示出在本轮横盘整理期间的安全领导力，并且如果股市进一步下跌，很可能会表现出色。

- en: For the bulls, consider this chart of the relative performance of Homebuilders
    against the market (top panel) and the stock market (bottom panel). Homebuilders
    bottomed out on a relative basis last October and they have been rallying on a
    relative basis ever since. Currently the group is testing a relative support level,
    but the relative uptrend remains intact. The Fed's QE3 program specifically targets
    the MBS market, which should benefit the housing sector. This is a signal to get
    long and don't fight the Fed.

  zh: 对于多头，可以考虑这张住宅建筑商相对于市场（顶部面板）和股市（底部面板）的表现图表。住宅建筑商在去年十月的相对基础上触底，并且自那时以来一直在相对基础上上涨。目前该群体正在测试一个相对支撑水平，但相对上涨趋势仍然保持不变。美联储的QE3项目特别针对MBS市场，这应该有利于住宅部门。这是一个买入信号，不要与美联储作对。
- en: A similar analysis of the gold miners showed this group rallied through a relative
    downtrend line in late August and they have been in a relative uptrend ever since.
    Gold should benefit from the latest trend of quantitative easing by central banks
    around the world, which amount to competitive devaluation that benefits the value
    of gold as an alternative currency.

  zh: 对黄金矿工的类似分析显示，这个群体在八月底相对下跌趋势线附近反弹，并且自那时以来一直处于相对上涨趋势中。黄金应该能从全球央行最近的量化宽松趋势中受益，这种趋势相当于竞争性贬值，有利于黄金作为一种替代货币的价值。

- en: In choosing sectors as candidates for investment, I like to see secular leadership
    independent of market direction. Telecom, which sports a higher than market yield,
    is usually thought of as being somewhat defensive in nature. Nevertheless, this
    sector has been leading the market since May. It remains in a relative uptrend
    and did not lag when the stock market began to run in June. This sector, along
    with the Homebuilders analyzed above, form the secular leadership in the stock
    market.

  zh: 在选择作为投资候选人的行业时，我喜欢看到无论市场方向如何都具有长期领导地位的行业。电信行业拥有高于市场的收益率，通常被认为是具有一定的防御性质。然而，自5月以来，这个行业一直领涨市场。它仍处于相对上升趋势中，在股市在6月开始飙升时并未落后。这个行业与上述分析的家装建筑行业一起，构成了股市的长期领导地位。

    in a down market, Health Care is a leading candidate. The sector has been rallying
    on a relative basis in the current sideways consolidation period. Should the market
