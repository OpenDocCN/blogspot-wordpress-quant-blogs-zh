    and July [capacity utilization](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capacity%20utilization)
    numbers in yesterday’s [Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization Since 1988](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/industrial-production-and-capacity.html),
    it is only fair to note that today’s [Philly Fed index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Philly%20Fed%20index)
    painted a much uglier picture of the manufacturing landscape.

  zh: 在昨天提到七月[工业生产](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/industrial%20production)和[产能利用率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capacity%20utilization)数字的积极惊喜之后，公正地说，今天的[费城联邦指数](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Philly%20Fed%20index)描绘了制造业形势的更糟糕的画面。
- en: 'Officially known as the Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey, the Philly
    Fed index is derived from a monthly survey of manufacturers in the [Third Federal
    Reserve District](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/about-the-fed/third-district-map/),
    which is comprised of Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey and all of Pennsylvania
    except for about the westernmost quarter of the state. Manufacturers are asked
    to indicate the direction of change in overall business activity and in the various
    measures of activity at their plants: employment; working hours; new and unfilled
    orders; shipments; inventories; delivery times; prices paid; and prices received.'

  zh: 正式名称为费城联邦储备银行商业展望调查的费城联邦指数来源于[第三联邦储备区](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/about-the-fed/third-district-map/)的月度制造商调查，该区域包括特拉华州、新泽西州南部一半和宾夕法尼亚州除西部四分之一以外的所有地区。制造商被要求指出整体商业活动以及他们工厂内各种活动的变化方向：就业、工作时间、新订单和未完成的订单、发货、库存、交货时间和支付的价格以及收到的价格。
- en: The results of these surveys are used to create a regional ‘diffusion index,’
    which is essentially the percentage of respondents who see an increase in activity
    minus the percentage of respondents who see a decrease. Respondents are asked
    to evaluate both current activity (current month versus last month) and their
    expectations for future activity (six months from now versus current month.)

  zh: 这些调查的结果被用来创建一个地区的“扩散指数”，这个指数本质上是指看到活动增加的受访者百分比减去看到活动减少的受访者百分比。受访者被要求评估当前活动（本月与上个月相比）以及他们对未来活动（六个月后与本月相比）的预期。
- en: The number that hits the headlines is a composite ‘general activity’ index covering
    all aspects of current activity. Today that number was -7.7, down from +5.1 in
    July. The number that rarely is reported is the future ‘general activity’ index,
    which fell from +25.0 to +19.6\. (see [press release](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2010/bos0810.cfm)

  zh: 出现在头条的是一个涵盖当前所有方面的综合“总体活动”指数。今天这个数字是-7.7，低于七月的+5.1。很少被报道的是未来的“总体活动”指数，从+25.0降到+19.6\.（参见[新闻稿](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2010/bos0810.cfm)和[回报表摘要](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2010/bos0810t.html)获取更多细节）

- en: I also like to look at some of the component data. Three of my favorites are
    new orders for a glimpse into the future, shipments for a sense of the current
    level of economic activity and employment, particularly given the heightened sensitivity
    to this issue and the need for wages to help repair the consumer balance sheet.
    The chart below captures all three of these components of the general activity
    index in the same format (percentage of respondents reporting an increase in activity
    minus those reporting a decrease.)

  zh: 我还喜欢查看一些分项数据。我最喜欢的三项分别是：新订单，以窥视未来；出货量，以感知当前的经济活动和就业水平，特别是考虑到对此问题的敏感性以及需要工资帮助修复消费者资产负债表。下面的图表以相同格式（报告活动增加的受访者百分比减去报告活动减少的受访者百分比）捕捉了总体活动指数的这三个组成部分。*
- en: The chart shows that while new orders have slipped from July to August, manufacturers
    in the Philadelphia area are still optimistic about an increase in orders six
    months from now and are even more optimistic this month than last month, reversing
    a declining trend. Shipments have also showed a decline from July to August, but
    again, respondents are optimistic about the situation six months from now.

  zh: 图表显示，虽然新订单从七月下降到八月，但费城地区的制造商仍然乐观地认为六个月后订单会增加，并且这个月比上个月更加乐观，扭转了下降趋势。出货量也从七月下降到八月，但同样，受访者对六个月后的情况持乐观态度。
- en: What really got my attention was the employment diffusion index, which shows
    relatively flat current employment from May to the present, but fairly significant
    declining expectations about employment six months from now. In fact, expectations
    are now for a slight decline in employment six months from now – the first time
    that manufacturers have been expecting a net decline in employment in over a year.

  zh: 真正引起我注意的是就业扩散指数，它显示从五月至今的就业相对平稳，但六个月后的就业预期有相当显著的下降。实际上，目前预期六个月后就业会有轻微下降——制造商预期就业净下降超过一年以来的第一次。
