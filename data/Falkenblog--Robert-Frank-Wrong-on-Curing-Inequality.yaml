    of status climbing. Basically, he posits that since we engage in a lot of conspicuous
    consumption to show off, we would benefit as a species from less consumption competition
    in the same way peacocks would benefit from having smaller tails (it would be
    less costly in terms of energy to produce, easier to evade predators). The key
    is having some sort of agreement outside-the-box that overcomes the individual
    incentive to overcompete, as when helmet laws in hockey make everyone safer. Thus,

    关键在于达成某种共识，克服个体过度竞争的动机，就像曲棍球头盔法则可以让每个人更安全一样。 因此，他

    of these places contain a lot of status competition, and there is a lot of anxiety

    然而，这些也是物质上平等的社会，在这些社会中，财富差距相对于“现实生活”而言是微不足道的。
- en: Reducing consumption inequality would not diminish status competition but rather
    channel it to less benign spheres. When a wealthy jerk buys a new Porsche or adds
    on to his summer cottage, this is much less annoying to me than the annoying jerks
    I knew in school (or conceive of in prison). Socialist countries where workers
    were not so material different had as much stress and anxiety than any Western
    country, which probably is why there is so much alcoholism in Cuba and Russia.

    at superficial skills like sales and public speaking, the intellectual thinks,
    they would be less stressed by their their lower status because they would have
    higher status! This is not merely self serving but untrue. The jocks and blow-hards
