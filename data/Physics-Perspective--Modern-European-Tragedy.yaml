- en: The endgame playing out in Europe is a tragedy in the usual sense, but also
    in the sense of Greek tragedy -- downfall brought about ironically through the
    very efforts, perhaps even well intentioned, of those ultimately afflicted. It's
    terrible to see Europe looming toward disaster, but also utterly fascinating that
    everyone involved -- Greeks, Germans, French, the European Central Bank -- has
    acted in what they thought was their own interest, yet those very actions have
    led the collective to a likely outcome much worse for all. A tragedy of the commons.

  zh: 正在欧洲上演的尾声是一场悲剧，但这悲剧不仅是在通常意义上，也是在希腊悲剧的意义上——那些最终受灾的人通过自己的努力（也许甚至是出于好意）带来的灾难性结局。看到欧洲一步步走向灾难是可怕的，但同样令人着迷的是，所有参与其中的人——希腊人、德国人、法国人、欧洲中央银行——都按照他们认为的自己的利益行事，然而正是这些行为导致了集体的可能结果，对所有人来说都更糟。这是公共悲剧。

- en: The euro was the very project that was meant to unify Europe and turn a rough
    amalgam of states in a free market arrangement into a genuine social, cultural
    and economic unity. But it has ended up disunifying the region and creating perverse
    effects, such as the spectacular rise of the populist right in countries like
    the Netherlands, for just about every member state, even dear old Finland.

  zh: 欧元本是一个旨在统一欧洲的项目，将一个自由市场安排的粗略混合体转变为一个真正的社会、文化和经济统一体。但它最终导致了地区的分裂，并产生了诸如荷兰等国家民族主义右翼的惊人崛起，几乎对每个成员国来说都是如此，甚至是亲爱的老芬兰。

- en: What makes this a tragedy is that we knew some of this all along — economic
    seers of various stripes had so prophesied — and still we conspired with it out
    of arrogance, dogma and complacency.  European leaders — technocrats whom Paul
    Krugman dubbed this week “[boring cruel romantics](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/opinion/boring-cruel-euro-romantics.html)”
    — ignored warnings that the euro was a politically motivated project that would
    simply not work given the diversity of economies that the system was meant to
    cover. The seers, indeed, [said it would fail](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/business/global/the-rise-of-a-euro-doomsayer.html);
    politicians across Europe ignored the warnings because it didn’t fit their version
    of the fantasy of Europe as a counterweight to United States’ hegemony. Bad deals
    were made, some lies were told, the peoples of the various member countries were
    bludgeoned into compliance often without being consulted, and now the proverbial
    chickens are coming home to roost.

  zh: 使这成为悲剧的是，我们一直都知道其中的一些——形形色色的经济预言家已经预言过了——然而我们还是傲慢、教条、自满地与之共谋。欧洲领导人——本周保罗·克鲁格曼称之为“[无聊而残忍的浪漫主义者](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/opinion/boring-cruel-euro-romantics.html)”的技术官僚——忽视了警告，认为欧元是一个出于政治动机而不会成功的项目，鉴于该系统旨在涵盖的经济多样性，这个项目是不会成功的。预言家们，确实[说过它会失败](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/business/global/the-rise-of-a-euro-doomsayer.html)；欧洲的政客们忽视了这些警告，因为这些警告不符合他们对欧洲作为对抗美国霸权的平衡力量的幻想。做出了糟糕的交易，有些谎言被说出，各个成员国的人民经常在没有被咨询的情况下被赶到顺从，现在，所谓的“鸡”正在回来。

    unspooling in the desperate attempts to shore up the European Union while accepting
    no responsibility for the unfolding disaster is something that we both willed
    and that threatens to now destroy the union in its present form.
