    of his rather innocuous speculation about gender talent distributions.  If a bank
    with $140B in market cap and over $2000B in assets loses $2B trading credit insurance,
    it sounds like no big deal, yet everyone, including Dimon, saw this as a a 'terrible,
    egregious, inexcusible mistake.'

    problems it is.  For example, consider

  zh: 大型银行的游戏似乎不再包括使用按市值计价的套期保值（他们甚至谈论到了刑事指控）。这可能并非坏事，因为大型企业套期保值往往被恶意使用。理论上这本不必如此，但鉴于代理问题，实际情况确实如此。例如，考虑

- en: tried to get very clever with their oil hedges and ended up having to eat a
    billion dollar loss. I know of a brokerage where in 2001 they discovered that
    their business was positively correlated to the stock market, so the CEO put on
    a big hedge shorting the market.  When the hedge made $20MM, he pocketed several
    million as a 'trader bonus', though surely it was a corporate hedge if it went
    the other way.  Then there's the history of gold companies, who discovered in
    the 1990s that shareholders don't want their companies hedging their core business
    with futures, they buy them in part for this exposure and don't like the idea
    that buying gold companies means their beta with gold prices is ambiguous.  Most
    gold companies now are long gold, which suits everyone just fine.  One could go
    on and on about how hedging core business risks has screwed up companies.

  zh: 试图通过石油对冲变得非常聪明，结果却不得不吞下十亿美元的损失。我知道一家经纪公司在2001年发现其业务与股市正相关，于是CEO进行了大规模的市场做空对冲。当对冲赚得2000万美元时，他作为“交易员奖金”私吞了数百万，尽管如果对冲失败，这显然是公司层面的对冲。再看看黄金公司的历史，他们在90年代发现股东不希望公司用期货对冲其核心业务，他们购买这些公司部分是因为这种风险敞口，不喜欢购买黄金公司意味着与黄金价格的贝塔值不明确的想法。现在大多数黄金公司都持有黄金多头，这正合大家心意。关于对冲核心业务风险如何搞砸公司，可以继续说个不停。
- en: The notion that by definition hedges have zero expected profit and so lose money
    quite often seems totally alien to most legislators, journalists, and commentators,
    which is fine, but for Dimon to not mount a defense at all suggests either a really
    lame attempt to appear humble or suggests he has no idea what hedging means either.
     Sandy Weill's hand-picked apprentice doesn't know much about  underwriting or
    portfolio management, but he does know a lot about the kind of thing Weill confused
    with banking, which is mainly acquisitions, PR and regulatory glad-handling.

  zh: 对冲在定义上预期利润为零，因此经常亏损的概念对大多数立法者、记者和评论员来说似乎完全陌生，这没关系，但迪蒙完全没有进行辩护，要么是试图显得谦逊的非常蹩脚的尝试，要么是他也不知道对冲意味着什么。桑迪·威尔亲手挑选的学徒对承销或投资组合管理知之甚少，但他对威尔混淆为银行业的那些事情了解很多，主要是收购、公关和监管方面的讨好。
