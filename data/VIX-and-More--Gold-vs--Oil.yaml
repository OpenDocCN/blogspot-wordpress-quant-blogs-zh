- en: As the chart below shows, gold has had quite a run too (see the area chart),
    but lately oil has been outperforming gold.  One way to interpret this ratio chart
    is to think of what an ounce of gold would cost if it were priced in barrels of
    oil. As anyone who has been to [Dubai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai) lately
    can tell you, it is taking less and less oil to buy an equivalent amount of gold
    these days.

  zh: 如下图所示，黄金价格也经历了大幅上涨（参见面积图），但近期原油的表现优于黄金。解读这种比率图表的一种方式是考虑如果黄金以桶油的价格来定价，一盎司黄金会价值多少。正如最近去过[迪拜](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai)的人可以告诉你的，现在用越来越少的石油就能买到同等数量的黄金。
- en: There was a time when a house was considered to be one of the best hedges against
    inflation.  Clearly that is not the case at the moment – at least in the US.  Gold
    has historically been an even better inflationary hedge, but lately oil has outpaced
    gold in that area.  The oil trade is very crowded at the moment and when oil turns
    down, there will still be many who are seeking alternative hedges against inflation.  Don’t
    be surprised if a lot of that oil money flows into gold and sends the gold to
    oil ratio back toward historical norms.

  zh: 曾经，房产被认为是抵御通货膨胀的最佳避险资产。显然，现在情况并非如此——至少在美国是这样。黄金在历史上一直是更好的抗通胀避险资产，但近期在抗通胀方面，原油已经超越了黄金。目前石油交易非常拥挤，当石油价格下跌时，仍会有很多人寻求其他抵御通货膨胀的避险资产。如果大量石油资金流入黄金，推动黄金对石油比率回归历史常态，不要感到惊讶。
