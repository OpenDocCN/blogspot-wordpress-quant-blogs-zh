    or seller's decisions can affect the market price. For example, if a firm can
    affect the market price by threatening to limit supply, the market does not satisfy

    individually negotiate their compensation, then the market is not producing an

    perfectly substitutable so that as far as the buyer is concerned, one is as good
    as the other. If some buyers favor one brand over another, if CEOs are perceived
    to have different and unique talents, this condition does not hold. In many cases

    Most people understand free entry, but free exit is sometimes less evident, so
    let me try to give an example. Starting a blog on Blogger or TypePad is easy.
    Entry is a snap and you can be up and running in no time at all. It's easy to
    join the competition and start supplying posts. But suppose that later you decide
    you want to switch to, say, TypePad from Blogger (or the other way around). That
    is not so easy. There is no way, at least no simple and convenient way, to export
    all of your old posts from Blogger and import them into TypePad, a significant
    barrier to exit if a large number of posts must be moved. Whenever barriers exist
    in markets that prevent free movement into and out of the marketplace or between
    firms within a market (on either side - there are sometimes barriers to purchasing
    as well), markets will underperform.

    be no externalities, no public goods, no false market signals, no moral hazard,
    no principle agent problems, and, importantly, property rights must be well-defined
    (and I probably missed a few). In general, the incentives that the market provides
    must be consistent with perfect competition, or nearly so in practical applications.
    When the incentives present in the marketplace are inconsistent with a competitive

    of companies will have an incentive to use public funds in a way that maximizes

    scale, or require specialized knowledge so that only one or a few private sector
    firms are large enough or specialized enough to do the job, why would we expect

    oversight, even libertarians agree that governments must intervene to ensure basics
