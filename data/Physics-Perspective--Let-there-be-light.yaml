- en: My Bloomberg column this month looks at an idea for improving the function of
    the interbank lending market. The idea is radical, yet also conceptually very
    simple. It's radical because it proposes a complete transformation of banking
    transparency. It shows how transparency may be the best route to achieving overall
    banking stability and efficiency. It will be interesting to see what free-market
    ideologues think of the idea, as it doesn't fit into any standard ideological
    narrative such as "get government out of the way" or "unregulated markets work
    best." It offers a means to improve market function -- something one would expect
    free-market cheerleaders to favor -- but does so in a way that threatens banking
    secrecy and also involves some central coordination.

  zh: 他们论点的基本逻辑是这样的。他们从一点出发，即标准的金融理论是基于对金融机构评估风险能力的完全不切实际的假设。即使这些机构中的个人是理性的，今天市场的复杂性如此之高，以至于由于信息不足，判断系统风险变得不可能：
- en: Since the beginning of banking the possibility of a lender to assess the riskiness
    of a potential borrower has been essential. In a rational world, the result of
    this assessment determines the terms of a lender-borrower relationship (risk-premium),
    including the possibility that no deal would be established in case the borrower
    appears to be too risky. When a potential borrower is a node in a lending-borrowing
    network, the node’s riskiness (or creditworthiness) not only depends on its financial
    conditions, but also on those who have lending-borrowing relations with that node.
    The riskiness of these neighboring nodes depends on the conditions of their neighbors,
    and so on. In this way the concept of risk loses its local character between a
    borrower and a lender, and becomes systemic.

    risky bank in the following is a bank that – should it default – will have a substantial
    impact (losses due to failed credits) on other nodes in the network. The idea
    of network metrics is to systematically capture the fact, that by borrowing from
    a systemically risky bank, the borrower also becomes systemically more risky since
    its default might tip the lender into default. These metrics are inspired by PageRank,

- en: But Thurner and Poledna do go further in making a specific proposal for using
    this information in a sensible way to reduce systemic risks. Here's how that works.
    Banks in the interbank market borrow funds for varying amounts of time from other
    banks. Typically, there's a standard interbank interest rate prevailing for all
    banks (as far as I understand). Hence, a bank looking to borrow doesn't really
    have much preference as to which bank it finds as a lender; the interest paid
    will be the same. But if the choice of lender doesn't matter to the borrowing
    bank, it does matter a lot to the rest of us, as borrowing from a systemically
    risky bank threatens the financial system. If the borrower can't pay back, that
    risky bank could be put into distress and cause trouble for the system at large.
    So, we really should have banks in the interbank market looking to borrow first
    from the least systemically risky banks, i.e. from those with low values of DebtRank.

  zh: 但是Thurner和Poledna在如何合理使用这些信息以降低系统风险方面走得更远。这是如何运作的。在银行间市场上，银行从其他银行借入不同期限的资金。通常，所有银行都有一个标准的银行间利率（据我了解）。因此，寻求借款的银行在选择贷款银行方面并没有太多的偏好；所支付的利息是相同的。但是，如果贷款银行对贷款银行的選擇并不重要，那么这对我们其他人来说非常重要，因为从系统风险高的银行借款威胁到整个金融系统。如果借款人无法偿还，那家高风险银行可能陷入困境，给整个系统带来麻烦。因此，我们真的应该让在银行间市场上寻求借款的银行首先从系统风险最低的银行借入，即从那些债务等级值低的银行借入。
- en: 'This is what Thurner and Poledna propose. Let central banks regulate that borrowers
    in the interbank market do just that -- seek out the least risky banks first as
    lenders. In this way, banks acting to take on lots of systemic risk would thereby
    be marked as too dangerous to make further loans. Further borrowing would instead
    be undertaken by less risky banks, thereby improving the spread of risks across
    the system. Don''t trust in the miracle of the free market to make this happen
    -- it won''t -- but step in and provide a mechanism for it to happen. As the authors

  zh: 这就是Thurner和Poledna的提议。让中央银行规定银行间市场上的借款人在借款时就是这样做的——首先寻找最安全的银行作为贷款人。这样，承担大量系统风险的银行因此被标记为太危险而不能进一步放贷。进一步的借款将由风险较低的银行承担，从而改善系统中的风险分散。不要相信自由市场奇迹会发生这种情况——它不会——但介入并提供一个使其发生的机制。正如作者所描述的：
- en: The idea is to reduce systemic risk in the IB network by not allowing borrowers
    to borrow from risky nodes. In this way systemically risky nodes are punished,
    and an incentive for nodes is established to be low in systemic riskiness. Note,
    that lending to a systemically dangerous node does not increase the systemic riskiness
    of the lender. We implement this scheme by making the DebtRank of all banks visible
    to those banks that want to borrow. The borrower sees the DebtRank of all its
    potential lenders, and is required (that is the regulation part) to ask the lenders
    for IB loans in the order of their inverse DebtRank. In other words, it has to
    ask the least risky bank first, then the second risky one, etc. In this way the
    most risky banks are refrained from (profitable) lending opportunities, until
    they reduce their liabilities over time, which makes them less risky. Only then
    will they find lending possibilities again. This mechanism has the effect of distributing
    risk homogeneously through the network.

    with encouraging results. The model involves banks, firms and households and their
    interactions; details in the paper for those interested. Bottom line, as illustrated
    in the figure below, is that cascading defaults through the banking system become
    much less likely. Here the red shows the statistical likelihood over many runs
    of banking cascades of varying size (number of banks involved) when borrowing
    banks choose their counterparties at random; this is the "business as usual" situation,
    akin to the market today. In contrast, the green and blue show the same distribution
    if borrowers instead sought counterparties so as to avoid those with high values
