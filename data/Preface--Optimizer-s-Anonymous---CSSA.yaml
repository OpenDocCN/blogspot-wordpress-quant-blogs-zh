    Whether its the “turtles,” Ed Seykota, Larry Hite, or Michael Covel, a key concept
    that is emphasized is “robustness.” If you are a hard-core mathematician type,
    you tend to scoff at the homely, grandfatherish advice being espoused by the trend-following
    crew. They spin simplistic tales of creating systems that work across markets,
    and finding strategies that work over long periods of time. They preach about
    fat tails, and the unknowable future. The fact is that these guys are really on
    to something. The field of robust statistics emphasizes a lot of these principles,
    and truthfully PhD trained economists, physicists and finance geeks tend to ignore
    them at their own peril. The who’s who in the  history of hedge fund blow ups
    is littered endlessy with ivy league quant gurus. I dare you to show me a single
    hedge fund that blew up trading the 200-day moving average across asset classes.

  zh: 趋势追踪研究中有许多有价值的概念可以借鉴。无论是“海龟”，Ed Seykota，Larry Hite，还是Michael Covel，一个被强调的关键概念是“鲁棒性”。如果你是一个核心的数学家类型，你往往会嘲笑趋势追踪团队所宣扬的朴实、像祖父一样的建议。他们讲述创建跨市场系统的故事，并找到长期有效的策略。他们宣扬肥尾理论和不可预知的未来。事实上，这些人真的发现了一些东西。鲁棒统计学领域强调了许多这些原则，老实说，博士培训的经济学家、物理学家和金融极客往往会忽视它们，这是他们自己的风险。历史上对冲基金崩溃的知名人物名单中充满了常春藤联盟的量化大师。我敢打赌，没有一个对冲基金是因为跨资产类别的200天移动平均交易而崩溃的。
- en: The colorful introduction is meant to grab your attention, and shake you up.
    Deep down in the depths of human psychology we really crave certainty and consistency.
    Accepting that we can’t control the future is a battle we have to fight every
    day. Sadly the smarter you are the harder this is to accept. Tell me you haven’t
    fallen prey to the dreams of creating endless riches by optimizing your favorite
    indicator. I remember dark moments myself many moons ago trading e-minis dreaming
    of Freedom 35\. I would change my indicator settings daily, desperately trying
    to find the magic setting that would prevent me from getting whipsawed nearly
    every day.  When i started trying to design stock screens for the first time,
    i went crazy backtesting every possible combination. I was hoping to find the
    one combination of P/E ratios or EPS growth that would always win. If this was
    you, there is hope, and I would like to share with you my story. The first step
    in Optimizer’s Anonymous is recognizing that you have an optimizing problem!

- en: 'Fortunately, I had a tremendous advantage over the rest of you: the software
    i learned on only kept 5 years of historical data and rolled forward every week.
    As I furiously tested away, I got to see how the screens that i built performed
    using a new start date. As time rolled on, i got to see how my screens performed
    in real life as well as their equity curves before and after.  It was an incredibly
    valuable experience that everyone should try for at least a few years. I started
    realizing though the course of testing that the more specific my parameters were,
    the noisier they performed out of sample. This problem was made even worse as
    i expanded the number of parameters. Selecting a price-earnings ratio of 7 or
    lower was unstable enough, but it was made worse by choosing stocks with an ROE
    higher than 15, and earnings growth greater than 20%. This led me on the path
    of using percentiles which i have already become notorious for on this blog—and
    with my professor friends. Another advantage was that i always tested across sectors
    simultaneously, under the assumtion that the underlying screen as a concept was
    more important than the idiosyncracies of a given industry. I tested like this
    for years even before receiving a formal education, and having that backround
    allowed me to design models that actually worked in real-life.'

  zh: 幸运的是，我比你们其他人有一个巨大的优势：我所学习的软件只保留了5年的历史数据，并且每周向前滚动。当我疯狂地测试时，我可以看到我构建的屏幕使用新的开始日期表现如何。随着时间的推移，我可以看到我的屏幕在现实生活中的表现以及它们的权益曲线在之前和之后。这是一次非常宝贵的经验，每个人都应该尝试至少几年。在测试过程中，我开始意识到我的参数越具体，它们在样本外的表现就越嘈杂。当扩大参数数量时，这个问题变得更糟。选择7或更低的市盈率是不够稳定的，而选择ROE超过15和收益增长超过20%的股票使情况变得更糟。这导致我开始使用百分位数，关于这一点我在博客上已经臭名昭著——以及我的教授朋友们。另一个优势是我总是同时跨行业测试，前提是底层屏幕作为一个概念比特定行业的个性更重要。我在正式教育之前就这样测试了好几年，有这个背景让我能够设计在现实生活中真正起作用的模型。
- en: 'Trading strategies should be designed based on concepts, relationships, and
    logical theories. A theory that is not generalizable is more likely to be valid
    that one that is highly specific. The greater the number of unique environments
    that a backtest can survive–the more likely it is to be robust. Building upon
    these observations are my prescriptions for Optimizer’s Anonymous:'
