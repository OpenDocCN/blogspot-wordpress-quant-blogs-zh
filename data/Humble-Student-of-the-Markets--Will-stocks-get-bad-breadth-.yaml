    strength of small and mid-cap stocks relative to their large cap counterparts.
    Small and mid caps have been on a tear against large cap stocks. Technicians interpret
    small cap strength as positive breadth - the broader based the advance, the more
    bullish momentum there is.

    and I-told-you-so disposition of the bulls is soaring, and overconfidence is rampant.
    And the timbre and tone of Slope is changing as well. In my own self, I have sense
    a deep and persistent disturbance – and despair – which just tells me what this
    market has done to me. And looking at stuff like Tesla – hell, yeah, it’s a great
    car, but Jesus Christ, this stock chart is just comic.

- en: With the Russell 2000 closing at 1059.88 and the presence of relative resistance
    in both mid and small caps stocks, it suggests that the risk/reward ratio for
    the higher beta small and mid-cap stock averages are on borrowed time. If small
    and mid-caps do fail at these key relative resistance levels, then the stock market
    will be said to be suffering from bad breadth - and another technical underpinning
