- en: The first 5 days of 2008 have been brutal - and so were the last 3 days of 2007\.
    The Nasdaq has finished lower all 8 days while the S&P 500 and Dow 30 each have
    had two marginally up days during the period. After all this selling you would
    think there would be some solid quantifiable edges based on price oscillators.

  zh: 2008年的前5天非常艰难——2007年的最后3天也是如此。纳斯达克指数在过去的8天里每天都收盘下跌，而标普500和道琼斯30指数在这段时间内各自有两天小幅上涨。经过这么多的抛售，你可能会认为基于价格振荡器会有某些坚实的、可以量化的优势。
- en: I ran several tests tonight looking at such things as RSI, Stochastics, percent
    drops and consecutive lower closes on the major indices. The story was the same
    whereever I looked. Chances of a bounce within the next 3-5 days weren't much
    better than a coin flip. When I took into account the longer term picture of the
    market and included such factors as the market is trading below its major moving
    averages or that is has just recently broken below consolidation levels the results
    looked even worse. In most cases risks outpaced rewards by a fair amount and a
    coin flip was generous odds.

  zh: 我今晚运行了几项测试，研究了RSI、随机指标、主要指数的百分比跌幅和连续下跌收盘等因素。无论我看哪里，情况都是一样的。未来3-5天内出现反弹的概率并不比抛硬币好多少。当我考虑到市场的长期情况，并包括市场交易在其主要移动平均线以下或刚刚突破整理水平等因素时，结果看起来甚至更糟。在大多数情况下，风险超过了收益，而抛硬币给出的赔率都很慷慨。
- en: A bounce may happen any day, but the VXO study I posted the other night laid
    it out pretty well. Risks remain elevated. My Capitulative Breadth Indicator (CBI)
    was the one piece of evidence showing a strong edge to the long side. As I noted
    earlier, that edge has dissipated. Stepping back and waiting for a better edge
    to appear looks like the right thing to do at this point.

  zh: 任何一天都可能发生反弹，但我在昨晚发布的VXO研究已经说得相当明白了。风险仍然很高。我的 Capitulative Breadth Indicator
    (CBI) 是唯一显示长期上涨有强烈优势的证据。正如我之前提到的，那种优势已经消失了。退一步，等待更好的优势出现，目前看来是正确的事情。
