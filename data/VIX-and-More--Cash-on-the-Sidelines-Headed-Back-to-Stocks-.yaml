    I posted a chart based on money market mutual fund cash levels as calculated by
    the Investment Company Institute’s (ICI) that generated a considerable amount
    of discussion when I concluded that the chart may be pointing to a topping trend
    for [cash on the sidelines](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/cash%20on%20the%20sidelines).'

  zh: 两个月前，在[图表一周：现金持仓趋势的变化？](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/chart-of-week-change-of-trend-in-cash.html)一文中，我发布了一张基于投资公司协会（ICI）计算的货币市场共同基金现金水平的图表，当我得出结论，这张图表可能指向[现金在边际](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/cash%20on%20the%20sidelines)的趋势顶部时，引起了相当大的讨论。
- en: Fast forward to the present and as the updated version of the same chart shows,
    the mid-January drop in money market mutual fund cash levels turns out to indeed
    have been the beginning of a change in trend, at least according to the ICI data.

  zh: 快进到现在，根据同一图表的更新版本显示，1月中旬货币市场共同基金现金水平的下降确实标志着趋势变化的开始，至少根据ICI数据来看。

  zh: 事实上，上周的数据，截止周三，显示货币市场共同基金现金水平在过去六个月中最大跌幅。
- en: With rates on money markets and bonds both headed lower, I would not be surprised
    to see more money flowing back into stocks for the simple reason that alternative
    investments have become less attractive.

  zh: 随着货币市场和债券利率都在下降，我不会感到惊讶，看到更多的资金流回股市，因为替代投资变得不那么有吸引力。
