- en: I actually received a large volume of what could best be chararcterized as “hate
    mail” for one of the previous [posts](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/
    "A Simple Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels") on percentile
    channels. In reading these comments I was reminded of Jimmy Kimmel’s funny segments
    where celebrities read mean tweets about themselves. While I did not publish these
    comments (I do not wish to alienate or prohibit those people who are kind enough
    to comment on the blog), needless to say most of them implied that I had presented
    a fraudulent strategy that badly misrepresented true performance. Since exact
    details were not provided on the strategy this is a difficult claim to justify.
    As a mountain of such comments piled in, I decided that it would be useful at
    this time to clarify how the allocations were calculated. The initial strategy
    was developed using a pre-built testing platform in VBA, so presenting the details
    for how the strategy calculates positions is easier than taking the time to build
    it in a spreadsheet.

  zh: 我实际上收到了大量可以最好地描述为“恶意邮件”的内容，针对以前[帖子](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/
    "A Simple Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels")中的百分位通道。在阅读这些评论时，我想起了吉米·基梅尔（Jimmy
    Kimmel）有趣的片段，其中名人们读取关于自己的恶意推文。尽管我没有发布这些评论（我不希望排斥或禁止那些善意评论博客的人），但多数评论都暗示我提出了一个严重误导真实表现的欺诈策略。由于策略的确切细节未提供，这是一个难以证明的断言。当这些评论堆积起来时，我决定现在澄清资产配置是如何计算的会很有用。最初的策略是使用VBA中的预先构建的测试平台开发的，因此呈现策略如何计算仓位的细节要比花时间在电子表格中构建它更容易。
- en: 'It is rare that I present a formal strategy on this blog for several good reasons:
    1) this is a blog for **new ideas** to inspire new strategies not for sharing
    code or spoon-feeding people with recipes 2) people actually pay money for strategies
    in the quantitative investment business, and giving one away for free seems like
    a pretty good deal. Who ever complains about free food? Hint: No one. 3) whenever
    I post strategies or indicators I get flooded with demands for spreadsheets and
    code. The tone of such emails is often terse or even desperate and implies that
    I have some sort of obligation to assist readers with replication or implementation
    on their end. Since the blog is free and competes for my often limited time while
    engaging in unrelated but paid business activities, meeting such demands is difficult
    to justify. I would comment that even the authors of academic articles to reputable
    journals rarely provide either: a) easy instructions for replication–in fact it
    is notoriously difficult to replicate most studies since either the instructions
    are vague or details are missing or b) assistance/support— authors rarely if ever
    provide assistance with replication and rarely answer such requests, even when
    their articles are supposed to contribute to some body of research (unlike a blog).
    I would like to think that CSSA has been considerably more generous over the years.'

  zh: 这个博客很少提供正式的策略，有几个很好的原因：1）这是一个用于激发新策略灵感而不是分享代码或用菜谱喂人的博客，为了量化投资而付费的人实际上买策略，免费赠送一个似乎是一笔很划算的买卖。谁会抱怨免费的食物？提示：没有人。3）每当我发布策略或指标时，都会收到大量要求提供电子表格和代码的要求。这类电子邮件的语气通常很简短，甚至绝望，并暗示我有某种义务协助读者复制或实施。由于博客是免费的，并且竞争着我通常有限的时间，同时参与不相关但有偿的业务活动，满足这些需求很难合理化。我想评论一下，即使是著名期刊的学术文章的作者也很少提供：a）易于复制的简单说明
    - 实际上，复制大多数研究是非常困难的，因为说明模糊或细节缺失，或b）协助/支持 - 作者很少提供复制的协助，甚至很少回答这样的要求，即使他们的文章应该为某个研究领域做出贡献（不像博客）。我想
    CSSA 在这些年来表现得更加慷慨。
- en: 'As a former professor of mine used to say: “I think you are responsible for
    doing your own homework and using your own brain”– perhaps a novel concept to
    those who simply wish to coast of the hard work and individual thinking of others.
    So without turning this into a prolonged rant, here is a “simple” (I will refrain
    from using that word in the future after the latest experience) schematic of how
    allocations are calculated for the strategy:'

  zh: 正如我的一位前教授曾经说过的：“我认为你有责任自己做作业和使用自己的大脑” - 对于那些希望只是依赖他人的辛勤工作和个人思考的人来说，这可能是一个新颖的概念。因此，不要让这变成一场拖延的抱怨，以下是如何计算策略的分配的“简单”（在最新经验之后，我将在未来避免使用这个词）的图表：
- en: A couple key details first- the strategy was rebalanced monthly (allocations
    calculated and held through the month) and not daily. Also, the strategy is LONG
    ONLY. This means that any negative positions are ignored. The channel score or
    signals in the initial calculation can be long or short ie 1 or -1\. This is probably
    the key reason why readers were unable to replicate since they probably used 1
    or 0.

  zh: 首先，有几个关键细节 - 这个策略是每月重新平衡的（计算并持有整个月的分配），而不是每天。此外，该策略仅限多头。这意味着将忽略任何负头寸。初始计算中的信道分数或信号可以是多头或空头，即1或-1。这可能是读者无法复制的关键原因，因为他们可能使用了1或0。

- en: Notice that negative positions are used to calculate allocations but are ignored
    in the final calculations. Furthermore, the cash position is allocated as an excess
    to the total of active allocations and not included in the risk parity position
    sizing (which would make SHY a huge position due to its low volatility). So I
    hope that this helps reader’s implement/duplicate the strategy. Keep in mind that
    prior to 2006, some of the ETFs used had to be extended with other data which
    reader’s may not have access to. However, using ETF data only yields a sharpe
    ratio of about 1.5\. Beyond this- readers are on their own. Good Luck!

  zh: 注意，负值用于计算分配，但在最终计算中被忽略。此外，现金头寸被分配为超出主动分配总额的部分，并不包括在风险平价头寸规模中（这会使得SHY由于其低波动性而成为一个巨大的头寸）。因此，我希望这能帮助读者实施/复制该策略。请记住，在2006年之前，一些使用的ETF需要使用其他数据来扩展，这些数据读者可能无法获取。然而，仅使用ETF数据的夏普比率约为1.5。超过此值，读者需要自行探索。祝好运！
