- en: 'I read an article that Goldman Sachs’ flagship “Global Alpha”  fund [http://www.cnbc.com/id/44545789](http://www.cnbc.com/id/44545789)  was
    closed today following some hefty losses this year.  To many it is a dark day
    for quantitative trading/investing when the so-called “best and brightest” are
    hanging up their gloves. I wouldn’t read too much into this because Goldman likely
    saves its best and brightest for trading its own money instead of for clients.
    On that note, there is a whiff of fumes from a statement by GS that revealed ”
    potential liabilities” to now bankrupt Lehman Brothers. With respect to their
    claims against Lehman they wrote: “we cannot predict when the fund will be able
    to make final distributions, if any, to investors in the fund.”To me this raises
    questions as to whether the fund served merely as a vehicle to engage in shady
    and unfair dealings with its own trading desks. Perhaps that is why Blankenfein
    recently took the unusual step for a CEO to hire a personal lawyer?'

  zh: 我读到一篇文章说高盛的旗舰“全球阿尔法”基金[http://www.cnbc.com/id/44545789](http://www.cnbc.com/id/44545789)在今年遭受了沉重的损失后今天关闭了。
    对于许多人来说，这是量化交易/投资的黑暗时刻，所谓的“最优秀和最聪明”的人都要放弃了。 我不会对此读得太多，因为高盛很可能把最优秀和最聪明的人留给了为自己交易而不是为客户交易。
    在这方面，高盛发布的一份声明中透露出了一丝油腻，该声明揭示了对现已破产的雷曼兄弟的“潜在责任”。 关于他们对雷曼的索赔，他们写道：“我们无法预测基金何时能够向基金投资者进行最终分配，如果有的话。”对我来说，这引发了问题，即该基金是否仅仅是一个与自己的交易台进行不正当和不公平交易的工具。
    或许这就是为什么布兰肯费恩最近采取了对于一位CEO来说不寻常的举措，雇佣了一位个人律师？
- en: 'Furthermore to say that the Global Alpha fund was a high-speed computerized
    fund is a complete misnomer. Such behemoth hedge funds that trade for outside
    investors almost always run strategies that appear somewhat “conventional” (tactical
    asset allocation, buying undervalued securities, engaging in complicated over
    the counter derivative and fixed income strategies) and have modest turnover that
    is enhanced high speed execution.  In contrast, the strategies run internally
    are almost certainly higher frequency and built on tremendous structural edges
    gained from trading for and on behalf of clients.   To me, the closure of “Global
    Alpha”  highlights several points: 1) the markets are in the midst of tremendous
    global financial mess where conventional historical relationships have been severely
    disrupted by highly unpredictable movements in different assets—this was probably
    one of the reasons why Goldman had trouble especially since it is trading the
    Global Alpha with a lower frequency of trading 2) it is no longer  desirable for
    economic and practical reasons to trade scalable quantitative strategies on behalf
    of investors— their capital is not truly required for a firm like Goldman and
    investors are disruptive by exposing them to greater legal risk and unwanted transparency
    3) the best talent (aside from the internal GS trading group) is rapidly shifting
    to proprietary trading and high-frequency firms where it is most beneficial.'

  zh: 进一步说，将全球阿尔法基金描述为一个高速计算机化基金是完全错误的。这样的巨头对冲基金几乎总是运行一些看起来有点“传统”的策略（战术资产配置，购买被低估的证券，从事复杂的场外衍生品和固定收益策略），并且交易频率适中，但执行速度高。相比之下，内部运行的策略几乎肯定是更高频的，并建立在为客户交易和代表客户交易所获得的巨大结构优势之上。对我来说，“全球阿尔法”基金的关闭凸显了几个要点：1）市场正处于巨大的全球金融混乱之中，传统的历史关系受到不可预测的不同资产大幅扰乱的影响——这很可能是高盛遇到困难的原因之一，特别是因为它以较低的交易频率交易全球阿尔法基金
    2）出于经济和实际原因，代表投资者交易可扩展的量化策略已不再可取——高盛这样的公司不真正需要他们的资本，而且投资者通过将他们置于更大的法律风险和不需要的透明度中而产生干扰
    3）最优秀的人才（除了高盛内部交易团队）正在迅速转向专有交易和高频公司，在这些公司中他们是最有利可图的。
- en: Things are changing in the investment industry, and something tells me that
    this is a historic event that many will point to in the future as a turning point.
    The  jury is still out yet as to what these changes will be, but my intuition
    suggests that we are entering a new and different era for investment management.
    True “alpha” is quickly becoming a privatized business.

  zh: 投资行业正在发生变化，有种直觉告诉我这将是一个许多人在未来会将其视为转折点的历史性事件。关于这些变化将是什么，陪审团还在审议中，但我的直觉暗示我们正在进入投资管理的一个新的、不同的时代。"真正的阿尔法"正在迅速成为一个私有化业务。
