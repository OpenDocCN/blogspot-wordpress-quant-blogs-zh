- en: urged me to test the oil services ETF OIH instead of XLE for cointegration with
    crude oil price. Their reasoning is that OIH is composed of oil drilling companies
    such as Schlumberger and Baker Huhges, as opposed to XLE, which is composed of
    oil-production companies like Exxon. The oil-drillers are more cyclical and react
    more to spot oil price rather than far futures contract prices. The hope is that
    OIH will tend to cointegrate better with spot oil price than XLE because of this.
    The fact that OIH has higher volatility as a result is not a concern to the arbitrageur
    (as opposed to the hedger), who profits from high volatility. In any case, its
    volatility should “cancel out” that of the spot oil price and result in a spread
    that may actually be less volatile. I follow their advice and carry out the analysis
    of CL vs. OIH.

  zh: 他们敦促我测试与原油价格协整的石油服务ETF OIH，而不是XLE。他们的论点是OIH由像Schlumberger和Baker Huhges这样的石油钻探公司组成，而不是XLE，后者由像Exxon这样的石油生产公司组成。石油钻探公司更具周期性，更多地对现货油价而不是远期合约价格做出反应。希望因此OIH将比XLE更好地与现货油价协整。OIH因此具有更高的波动性，但这对于套利者（而不是对冲者）来说并不是一个担忧，因为套利者是从高波动性中获利的。不管怎样，它的波动性应该“抵消”现货油价的波动性，从而产生实际上可能更稳定的利差。我遵循他们的建议，并执行CL与OIH的分析。

- en: The plot is of the dollar value of long 1 contract of Cl and short 497 shares
    of OIH. They do cointegrate with over 90% probability. (I also plotted the 1 standard
    deviation lines of the spread to facilitate those who want to look for approximate
    entry points.) The cointegration probability is not measurably better than that
    between CL and XLE. However, the current spread (as of the close of Nov 20) is
    undervalued by only $9,617 (or 1.48 standard deviation), as opposed to $10,508
    (or 1.74 standard deviation) for the CL-XLE spread. (I determined the standard
    deviation of the CL-XLE spread to be about $6,040). So in recent months, one can
    indeed say that OIH is trading more in line with spot oil price than XLE. But
    as an arbitrageur who thinks the larger the spread, the bigger the profit opportunity,
    this is not an endorsement for buying the CL-OIH spread instead. Rather, I would
    consider adding this spread as a means of diversification.

  zh: 该图表是1份Cl合约的价值和497股OIH的短仓。它们有超过90%的概率进行协整。（我也绘制了利差的1个标准差线，以便那些想要寻找大致入场点的人。）协整概率不如CL与XLE之间的协整概率好。然而，截至11月20日收盘的当前利差低估了仅$9,617（或1.48个标准差），而CL-XLE利差低估了$10,508（或1.74个标准差）。（我确定了CL-XLE利差的标准差约为$6,040）。所以最近几个月，确实可以说OIH与现货油价的走势比XLE更一致。但作为认为利差越大，盈利机会越大的套利者，这并不是推荐购买CL-OIH利差的理由。相反，我会考虑将这种利差作为多元化的一种手段。
