    Sao Paolo, Brazil. I am amazed at how Brazil is exploding, and there seems to
    be a lot of evidence to support my observations.

- en: After the demise of the investment banking arm of Citadel Securities (search
    Google News for the term "Citadel Securities" to reconstruct the happenings),
    I rejoined some old friends in the world of capital markets consulting. It feels
    a bit strange to be sitting on the other side of the table from where I sat for
    the past 5 years, but since I came from a consulting background, the transition
    was pretty smooth. Now I am the vendor, and my former colleagues are clients,
    and I expect to get beaten up by them in the same way that I used to micro-examine
    the vendors who courted me. But, a challenge is a challenge, and I hope that my
    Wall Street experience can serve my new clients well.

  zh: 在Citadel证券的投资银行业务部门解散后（你可以在谷歌新闻中搜索“Citadel证券”来了解具体事件），我重新加入了一些在资本市场咨询领域的老朋友。从五年前我坐过的桌子另一边坐过来，感觉有点奇怪，但是因为我来自咨询背景，所以过渡非常顺利。现在我是供应商，我以前的同仁们成了客户，我预计他们会像我以前审查供应商一样对我进行严厉的审查。但是，挑战就是挑战，我希望我的华尔街经验能对我的新客户有所帮助。
- en: The first engagement that I had was in Miami Beach (yeah, life sucks, right?)
    for a few weeks in November. A client of ours has a product that is widely used
    in its industry, but there is a need for the product to be able to scale out massively
    in order to handle tens of thousands of simultaneous requests, and to be able
    to deal with more and more complex products. The current product was a mixture
    of some new .NET technology, combined with a lot of legacy VB6, ATL, C++, MFC,
    and the current system is designed to handle one request at a time.

  zh: 我第一次接到的工作是在迈阿密海滩（的生活真糟糕，对吧？），是在11月的一段时间。我们的一位客户在其行业内广泛使用其产品，但该产品需要能够大规模扩展，以处理数以万计的并发请求，并能处理越来越复杂的产品。当前的产品是使用一些新的.NET技术混合编写的，还包含大量的遗留VB6、ATL、C++和MFC代码，而现行的系统是设计为一请求一处理。

- en: My job was to propose a future state architecture that would allow them to scale
    up, handle failures gracefully, and allow pluggable components for pipelined processing
    of their data. One restriction was that their clients would incur zero or little
    additional cost. Without going into much detail, I ended up implementing a typical
    Wall Street compute-grid-like architecture using Rabbit MQ (hence, my previous
    posts on Rabbit) and Microsoft's Velocity Cache. This was an example where I was
    able to bring the kind of architecture that is typically found in Wall Street
    to a client who had never heard of grid computing before.

  zh: 我的工作是提出一个未来状态的架构，使他们能够进行扩展，优雅地处理故障，并允许可插拔的组件用于数据的流水线处理。一个限制条件是，他们的客户不会产生额外的零或少量成本。不详细说明，我最终实现了一个典型的华尔街计算网格架构，使用Rabbit
    MQ（因此，我之前的关于Rabbit的文章）和微软的Velocity缓存。这是一个典型的例子，我将通常在华尔街找到的架构带到了一个以前从未听说过网格计算的客户。
- en: For my current engagement, I am traveling down to Sao Paolo, Brazil, for two-week
    stretches for the next several months. I am the head technologist on a small team
    that is analyzing the current state and proposing a new future state architecture
    for our capital markets client. I am not going to talk about what we are doing
    for the client, but I want to give my impressions of Brazil and Sao Paolo.

    know that they are the next big thing. New York, without the tension and angst
    of New York. There are new office buildings springing up everywhere. Brookfield
    has an incredible new building under construction by the Faria Lima financial
    center. The Grand Hyatt's executive lounge crowded with all sorts of foreigners
    trying to get in on the action before others do.

- en: Sao Paolo is huge ... bigger than NYC ... but the office buildings are spread
    out all over the city. I did not get the feeling of a single financial district
    as you would find in NYC, Miami, Charlotte, or San Francisco. The subway (metro)
    is not as extensive as it is in NYC, so odds are that you need to take a taxi
    to go from office to office. Taxis are convenient and relatively inexpensive,
    but the traffic ....

- en: You really need to be able to speak Brazilian Portuguese. Whoever told me that
    everyone under 30 speaks English was lying. Your high school Spanish might bring
    you some comfort, but not much. Brazilians do not like speaking Spanish, but if
    you speak Spanish with a strong American accent, they might be willing to forgive
    you.

- en: Not everything is sunshine and lollipops .... Crime is something tangible and
    is definitely the huge thorn on the rose. I was told never to show a hint of my
    laptop while in a taxi, because roving gangs of motorcycle thieves are everywhere,
    and they will surround your taxi and take your laptop at gunpoint. A Brazilian
    that I was having dinner with had to take a taxi for the 5-block walk to his hotel
    because he was afraid of being robbed... and this was in a good section of Sao
    Paolo. Luxury hi-rise apartments look beautiful from your hotel room, but when
    you view them from the sidewalk, you see the 30-foot barbed-wire walls and teams
    of black-booted security guards patrolling the grounds.

  zh: 事情并非都是阳光和糖果... 犯罪是触手可及的，也绝对是这朵玫瑰上巨大的刺。我被告知在出租车上不要透露我笔记本电脑的丝毫线索，因为到处都是骑摩托车的流动盗贼团伙，他们会包围你的出租车，在枪口下抢走你的笔记本电脑。我晚餐时认识的巴西人不得不乘出租车去他酒店的5个街区，因为他害怕被抢劫...
    而且这还是在圣保罗一个不错的地区。豪华高层公寓从你的酒店房间看起来很美，但当你从人行道上看时，你会看到30英尺的带刺铁丝网和穿着黑靴子的保安巡逻队。
- en: Traffic is a mess too. Stand-still traffic at almost all hours of the day. If
    you are traveling between offices and you choose to go by taxi, give yourself
    an hour to go two miles.

- en: The traffic and the fear of crime combine to make Sao Paolo the city with the
    greatest number of helicopters per capita. Almost every office building has a
    helipad on the roof, and for a pilot like myself, it's exciting to see the constant
    flow of helicopters 500 feet above your head.

- en: It will be interesting to see if Sao Paolo and Rio can get their acts together
    before the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016\. Lots of problems to be
    solved. But, if Athens can do it, then Brazil should be able to pull it off too.

- en: Sao Paolo to make it an interesting challenge. But, I think that they are very
    receptive to Wall Street and City experience. A bunch of people have been anxious
    to know about my experience in Brazil because it seems that the mood on Wall Street
    has never been gloomier, and people want to have a bit of a change-up in their
    lives. My opinion is that a bit of international experience in Brazil will be
    very helpful to a career in Capital Markets, especially in the IT world. Certain
    investment banks are willing to send their folks to Brazil on a 3-year program.
    Why not roll the dice!

  zh: 圣保罗使其成为一个有趣的挑战。但是，我认为他们对华尔街和城市经验非常开放。有一群人急切地想了解我在巴西的经历，因为似乎华尔街的情绪从来没有这么沮丧过，人们想要在生活中有所改变。我的看法是，在巴西的国际经验将对资本市场，特别是在IT世界的职业生涯非常有帮助。一些投资银行愿意让他们的员工参加一个3年的巴西项目。为什么不冒险一试！
