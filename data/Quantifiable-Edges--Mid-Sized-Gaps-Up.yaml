- en: After the close today, Intel had a good report. Everyone seems happy (unless
    you’re short Intel.) The Nasdaq futures are juiced and the S&P’s are even up quite
    a bit as I write this. We stand a good chance of seeing a gap up tomorrow morning.
    There are some economic reports to deal with before the opening bell so things
    can clearly change, but it seems like a good idea to expect we may gap in the
    morning and to plan for it.

  zh: 今天收盘后，英特尔有个不错的财报。每个人似乎都很开心（除非你空头持有英特尔）。纳斯达克期货价格上涨，当我写这篇文章时，标普500指数甚至也上涨了很多。我们有很大的机会在明天早上看到一个向上跳空。在开盘之前还有一些经济报告要处理，所以情况显然可能会改变，但似乎可以期待明天早上市场会向上跳空，因此需要做好准备。
- en: Previously I’ve looked at large gaps up as well as large gaps down, and how
    the market reacted to them in both uptrends and downtrends. Today I will look
    at mid-sized gaps up.

  zh: 之前我曾研究过大幅上涨和大幅下跌，以及市场如何在上涨和下跌趋势中对它们的反应。今天我将研究中等规模的向上跳空。
- en: As a reminder I previously defined a large gap as one over 0.75% for the SPY.
    The mid-sized gaps I’m looking at tonight are gaps between 0.25% and 0.75%. Once
    again I will break the results out between mid-sized gaps up in uptrends and mid-sized
    gaps up in downtrends. You’ll find the results to be quite different from both
    each other and the large gap studies.

  zh: 作为提醒，我之前定义中大幅向上跳空的标准为SPY指数超过0.75%。我今晚要研究的中等规模向上跳空是指在0.25%到0.75%之间的跳空。再一次，我会将结果分别列出，对比上涨趋势中的中等规模向上跳空和下降趋势中的中等规模向上跳空。你会发现这些结果彼此之间以及与大幅跳空研究的结果都有很大不同。
- en: For uptrend vs. downtrend I kept it simple and used the same definition as last
    time. If the market closes above its 200-day simple moving average, it’s in an
    uptrend. If the market closes below it, then it’s in a downtrend.

  zh: 对于上涨趋势与下跌趋势，我使用了与上次相同的定义，保持了简单。如果市场收盘价高于其200日简单移动平均线，则处于上涨趋势。如果市场收盘价低于它，则处于下跌趋势。
- en: I looked at 3626 trading days going back to 11/17/93\. Of those there were 613
    mid-sized gaps up in uptrends and 223 mid-sized gaps up in downtrends.

  zh: 我研究了从93年11月17日开始的3626个交易日。其中，在上涨趋势中有613个中等规模的向上跳空，在下降趋势中有223个中等规模的向上跳空。
- en: Buying at the open and selling at the close when the market was in an uptrend
    would have been profitable about 50% of the time. In total the market would have
    gained 3% over the 613 trades. On a per-trade basis that’s basically break even.
    Of those gaps up 356 (58%) filled at some point during the day. (A fill in this
    case is defined as a move back down to the previous day’s close.)

  zh: 当市场处于上涨趋势时，以开盘价买入并以收盘价卖出，大约有50%的盈利率。总体上，市场在这613次交易中获得了3%的收益。每笔交易基本上都是盈亏平衡的。在这些向上跳空中，有356次（58%）在当天的某个时刻填补了跳空。在这种情况下，填补指的是价格回落到前一交易日的收盘价。
- en: Buying at the open and selling at the close when the market was in a downtrend
    would have been profitable 54% of the time. In total, though this strategy would
    have LOST you almost 66% over 223 trades. Per trade that’s close to a 0.3% loss
    on average from open to close. Of those mid-sized gaps up, 165 (73%) filled at
    some point during the day. Even with a slightly higher winning percentage these
    stats are significantly worse than those above dealing with uptrends.

  zh: 当市场处于下跌趋势时，以开盘价买入并以收盘价卖出，将有54%的盈利率。然而，在223次交易中，此策略会让你损失近66%。每笔交易的平均亏损接近0.3%。在这些中等规模的向上跳空中，有165次（73%）在当天的某个时刻填补了跳空。即使盈利率略高，这些统计数据也明显差于处理上涨趋势的数据。
- en: We previously found that large gaps up typically lead to more upside during
    a downtrend. Most likely this is because shorts get trapped and the market runs
    as they scramble to cover. Mid-sized gaps are a different animal. They are not
    as scary for the shorts. Shorts may even see it as an opportunity to add more
    exposure, while longs look to take gift profits. Whatever the reason, the long-tem
    downtrend is generally able to re-assert itself during the day and those that
    bought into the early morning excitement get punished.

  zh: 我们先前发现，大幅向上跳空通常会在下跌趋势中导致更多上涨。最有可能的原因是，空头被困，市场在他们匆忙平仓时开始上涨。中等规模的向上跳空则是一种不同的情况。对空头来说，它们并不那么可怕。空头甚至可能将其视为增加更多头寸的机会，而多头则寻求获利的机会。不管原因是什么，长期的下跌趋势通常能在当天重新确立自己，那些在早晨兴奋中购买的者会受到惩罚。
- en: 'When deciding how to approach a gap up in the morning, make sure you consider
    at least two things: 1) Long-term trend of the market. 2) The size of the gap.
    They both matter.'
