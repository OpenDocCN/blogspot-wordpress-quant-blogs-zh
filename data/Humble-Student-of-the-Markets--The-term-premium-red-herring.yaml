- en: About a week ago, market anxiety was high over surging Treasury yields, which
    was attributed to concerns over a soaring fiscal deficit and a rising supply of
    Treasury paper. This led to upward pressure on the term premium, or compensation
    for holding longer duration assets, and real yields.

  zh: 大约一周前，市场对国债收益率的飙升感到焦虑，这被归因于对不断扩大的财政赤字和国债供应增加的担忧。这导致了期限溢价（即持有更长期限资产的补偿）或实际收益率的上行压力。
- en: Here’s what has happened since the peak in rate anxiety. In the space of a week,
    the market had to face a blowout jobs report, a surprise Middle East war, and
    hot PPI and slightly hot CPI prints. In the face of such news, one would think
    this would put upward pressure on yields. Instead, Treasury yields retreated.

  zh: 自利率焦虑高峰以来发生了什么。在一周的时间里，市场不得不面对一份令人印象深刻的就业报告、一场意外的中东战争以及热腾腾的PPI和稍微热一点的CPI数据。面对这样的消息，人们可能会认为这将对收益率产生上行压力。相反，国债收益率却下跌了。
- en: The fall in yields was initially attributable to a flight to safety, but such
    an explanation doesn’t seem plausible as the USD Index fell in lockstep. If there
    had been a flight to safety, the USD would have been bid.

  zh: 收益率的下跌最初可以归因于避险情绪，但这种解释似乎不太可信，因为美元指数同步下跌。如果存在避险情绪，美元就会被买入。
- en: What happened? The most reasonable explanation is that the jitters over rising
    term premium and real rates was a red herring.

  zh: 发生了什么事？最合理的解释是，对上升的期限溢价和实际收益率的担忧是一个误导。
