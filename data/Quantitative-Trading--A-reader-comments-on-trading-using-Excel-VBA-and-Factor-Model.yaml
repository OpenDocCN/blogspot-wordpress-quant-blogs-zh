- en: One of the key merits in adopting an automatic trading system approach that
    has helped me is to avoid the temptation for manual interference and thereby improving
    profitability by maintaining consistency. I have found the challenge of developing
    a successful system very rewarding from a personal perspective as I recognise
    that there are many that have tried and failed. However one problem I have encountered
    is my ongoing desire to regularly modify and improve the system which I have found
    can become counter productive as there is a real danger that system development
    becomes an end in itself! I just can't seem to stop tinkering as soon as I come
    up with a new idea or feature!

  zh: 采用自动交易系统方法的一个关键优点是，它帮助我避免了手动干预的诱惑，从而通过保持一致性来提高盈利能力。从个人角度来看，我认为开发一个成功的系统非常有成就感，因为我认识到有很多人尝试过但失败了。然而，我遇到的一个问题是我持续想要定期修改和改进系统，我发现这可能会适得其反，因为系统开发确实存在成为其本身的危险！只要我提出一个新想法或特性，我就忍不住要开始鼓捣！
- en: One advantage of using Excel VBA that I have found is that it is inherently
    flexible as it facilitates the processing of data which can be important especially
    when using fundamental data as part of the system. In this respect I recognise
    that every trader is trying to build in an edge that will make the system more
    profitable. I have noticed that many traders seem to only focus on price by trying
    to seek an edge by looking at special indicators or combination of indicators
    etc. Combining price data analysis with a Factor Model approach is a challenge
    which is ideally suited Excel VBA as it can be easily used to process both fundamental
    and macroeconomic data into a form that can be integrated with price data analysis.

  zh: 我发现使用Excel VBA的一个优点是它本质上很灵活，因为它便于处理数据，这在使用基本面数据作为系统的一部分时尤其重要。在这方面，我认识到每个交易者都在尝试构建一个边缘，使系统更加盈利。我注意到许多交易者似乎只关注价格，通过寻找特殊指标或指标组合等方式来寻求优势。将价格数据分析与因子模型方法相结合是一个挑战，这使得Excel
    VBA非常适合使用，因为它可以轻松处理基本面和宏观经济数据，使其能够与价格数据分析相结合。
- en: I recognise from your book that Matlab is more powerful than Excel VBA and may
    be just as flexible in integrating fundamental and macroeconomic data but I just
    wanted to draw your attention to benefits I have found using Excel VBA which may
    suit those who like myself are more comfortable in using Excel VBA and are reluctant
    to change. Other features that can be exploited that I have found helpful when
    back testing are automatically producing Price Charts that incorporate Entry and
    Exit points which provides visual reassurance that the system is working as intended
    as well as generating automatic Word reports recording key output for future reference.

  zh: 我从你的书中了解到，Matlab比Excel VBA更强大，也许在整合基本面和宏观经济数据方面同样灵活，但我只是想引起你注意我使用Excel VBA发现的好处，这可能适合像我这样更愿意使用Excel
    VBA且不愿改变的人。在回测时，我发现有帮助的其他特性是自动生成包含入场和出场点的价格图表，这提供了视觉上的确认，系统正在按预期工作，同时生成自动的Word报告，记录关键输出以供将来参考。
