    lust, care, panic, grief, and play.  He's famous for documenting when rats laugh
    via  inaudible chirps that correspond to tickling and the appropriate brain scan
    signatures. Lots of mammals have the same emotions humans do, which should come
    as no surprise to dog owners. He notes that he purpose of play is to takes us
    to the point of bad things happening, which explains why my kids always seem to
    end play with someone crying. He sees an instinct for seeking social interaction
    that turns on once the stronger affects (fear, lust, rage) as well as hunger are
    in check. It's useful to have an instinct to seek novelty and company, and it
    appears this is hard-wired.  If you take too much opiates, or are autistic, this
    instinct is stifled.

    a hard tipping point is irrelevant, we are way past that. Further, given we have

    that this R and R research has caused great austerity implies a novel definition

    as a rule: optimizing too much leads to feeling bad about alternatives that are
    pretty similar. A lot in life is random, so if in picking a college or career
    you keep wondering ''what if?'' you will be less happy and it''s unhelpful because
    generally things you chose among were pretty similar. I think it''s a very interesting
    question how and when to constrain choices you present others: too much choice
    is onerous, but more choice can better fit someone''s unknown preferences. Unfortunately,
    those skeptical of the market seem drawn to think regulation could be of big help
    here; I think it''s far better to leave such choices to those with skin in the
    game and a knowledge of the customers.  That is, bureaucrats will often think
    more than 3 of something they don''t care about is enough, because for them it
    is, but that''s a very silly inference. The'

  zh: 我对Barry Schwartz的忠告持同情态度，即我们应该更多地作为一种规则来满足：过度优化会让人对相似的替代品感到不好。生活中很多事情是随机的，所以如果在选择大学或职业时不断地纠结于“如果呢？”，你会更不开心，而且毫无帮助，因为一般你所选择的事物都是相似的。我认为如何以及何时限制对他人的选择是一个非常有趣的问题：选择太多让人不堪重负，但更多的选择可以更好地适应他人未知的偏好。不幸的是，那些对市场持怀疑态度的人似乎认为监管可能会带来很大的帮助；我认为更好的做法是把这些选择留给那些对游戏有了解并且了解客户的人。也就是说，官僚们经常会认为对于他们不关心的某物超过3个就够了，因为对他们来说够了，但这是一个非常愚蠢的推断。
