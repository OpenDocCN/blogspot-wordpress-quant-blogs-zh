- en: Years ago I was asked what kept us from being Warren Buffett. My reply was "how
    Buffett picked stocks was fairly well-known. The problem was the inability of
    managers to tolerate excessive tracking error." This was quant-speak for "portfolio
    managers spent too much time building benchmark hugging portfolios for business
    reasons".

  zh: 多年前有人问我是什么阻碍了我们成为沃伦·巴菲特。我回答说：“巴菲特挑选股票的方法是相对众所周知的。问题在于经理们无法忍受过度的跟踪误差。” 这句是量化语言，“基金经理花费太多时间构建接近基准的组合，出于商业原因”。

- en: One of the effects of Buffett’s approach is that he won’t buy companies whose
    businesses he doesn’t understand or he deems “too difficult to run”. As a result,
    the portfolio will contain very few companies in certain industries, such as Technology.
    As any good quant can tell you, a lot of return risk can be explained by industry
    weightings and such a lopsided portfolio will have returns that are very different
    from the S&P 500.

  zh: 巴菲特方法的一个效果是，他不会购买他不懂的业务或者他认为“太难经营”的公司。结果是，投资组合中将包含某些行业（如科技行业）非常少量的公司。正如任何好的量化分析师可以告诉你的，很多风险回报可以归因于行业权重，这样的非对称投资组合将具有与标普500指数非常不同的回报。

    consider the value of that cash flow stream at purchase time. Buffett et al seems
    to care less about the value of the company in the marketplace after its purchase.
    After all, the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s unlisted subsidiaries are not reported
    anywhere nor can they reported since there is no publicly listed value for these
    companies. After BRK acquires them, they only get valued by the market based of
    their aggregate cash flows, asset values, etc.**'

- en: It can be done. I once worked with a taxable family trust that held an equity
    portfolio with many positions with very low cost basis (and therefore large capital
    gains liability if the position were to be sold). The objective of the trust was
    to provide its current beneficiaries with an income stream while preserving the
    inflation adjusted value of the capital for future generations.

  zh: 这是可以做到的。我曾经与一个应税家庭信托合作，该信托持有一个股票投资组合，其中许多仓位成本基础非常低（因此如果这些仓位被卖出，将会有大量的资本增值责任）。该信托的目标是为现任受益人提供收入流，同时为后代保留经通胀调整后的资本价值。
- en: The trustees decided to focus the portfolio on holding dividend paying stocks
    with good growth prospects. They created a synthetic benchmark based on the dividend
    growth metrics to measure the portfolio’s performance. Returns were measured on
    an after-tax basis. The hurdle rate for selling a stock with an embedded capital
    gain therefore was higher than normal because of the higher after-tax cost of
    replacing the dividend stream.

  zh: 受托人决定将投资组合专注于持有具有良好增长前景的股息支付股票。他们根据股息增长指标创建了一个合成基准，以衡量投资组合的表现。回报是在税后基础上计算的。因此，对于一个包含内含资本增值的股票而言，出售的门槛比正常情况要高，因为替换股息流的税后成本较高。
- en: 'As the portfolio manager for one of the trust’s portfolios, I found myself
    in the unusual situation of apologizing every time the market went up, even if
    the portfolio had outperformed: “Sorry, we made money for you this quarter (but
    that means that we can’t re-balance the portfolio and sell anything without taking
    the capital gains hit)”. Conversely, market declines were welcome because it afforded
    an opportunity to harvest some capital losses so that the portfolio could be re-balanced
    on a tax-efficient basis.'

  zh: 这个信托的故事是投资者了解自己的目标并坚持自己的目标的例子。在这个案例中，信托知道自己的目标并创造了自身的基准。受托人关注股息及其增长率（正如伯克希尔哈撒韦公司关注现金流及其增长率一样）。市场在此期间为这些投资支付的金额大多是噪音，可以忽略不计。
