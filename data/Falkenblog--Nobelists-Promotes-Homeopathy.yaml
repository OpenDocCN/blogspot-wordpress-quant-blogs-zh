    dilute it several times, it becomes a tonic! Say, add some cyanide to a liter
    of water, mix, then take out a centiliter of the mixture, and add to a liter of
    pure water; take out a centiliter of the mixture, etc. You can do this 20 times
    and basically no salt is left. Homeopathy believes that water has a 'memory' of
    compounds that were once dissolved in it, which through another mysterious mechanism
    explains how homeopathy works. Skeptics of homeopathy, like me, think homeopathic
    medicines have nothing in them because they are diluted too much. Poison and medicine
    is a function of dose, after all.

    20 次，基本上不会剩下任何盐。顺势疗法相信水有一种对它曾经溶解过的化合物的“记忆”，从而通过另一种神秘的机制解释了顺势疗法的作用。像我这样对顺势疗法持怀疑态度的人认为，顺势疗法药物中没有任何成分，因为它们稀释得太厉害了。毒药和药物终究是剂量的问题。

    that if one believes in God that should be relevant to their jobs even if they
    keep such beliefs private, or if it such beliefs had no obvious relation to their
    job (say, an eye surgeon who is otherwise competent believing in fairies). He
    basically thinks one can't be really good at a job if you believe in things he
    finds stupid. I obviously disagree--not just with what he thinks are stupid ideas,
    but also that such stupidity disqualifies one for applying idea in other areas.
    I find comfort in the many perverse beliefs in creative minds, perhaps because
    I disagree with the consensus on many things and it's self-serving.

  zh: 在肯塔基大学一桩宗教歧视案件上，争辩说，如果有人相信上帝，那应该与他们的工作相关，即使他们会保守这样的信仰，或者这样的信仰与他们的工作没有明显关系（比如，一个除了相信仙女外还是一个称职的眼科医生）。他基本上认为，如果你相信他认为愚蠢的东西，那就无法真正做好工作。我显然不同意——不仅对于他认为愚蠢的想法，而且不同意这种愚蠢排斥了人们在其他领域应用想法的资格。我对有创造力思想中的许多反常信仰感到欣慰，也许是因为我在很多事情上不同意共识，这对我有利。
