- en: One of the more important facts of life is that adults are often very disingenuous.
    When the executive VP says 'the United Way chairmanship was the most important
    job I had here at Amalgamated,' it is a lie; when they imply that their main satisfaction
    comes from knowing their customers or voters are better off, it is a lie. Sure,
    there's an element of truth to what they are saying, but emphasis is important
    too. So, lying is part of life, especially in regard to hierarchies, because any
    hierarchy needs some platitudes about the greater good to maintain their legitimacy.

  zh: 生活中的一个更重要的事实是，成年人经常表现得非常不真诚。当执行副总裁说“联合方式主席是我在Amalgamated最重要的工作”，这是谎言；当他们暗示他们的主要满足来自于知道他们的客户或选民过得更好时，也是谎言。当然，他们所说的有一定的真实性，但强调也很重要。所以，谎言是生活的一部分，特别是在层级制度方面，因为任何层级制度都需要一些关于更大利益的陈词滥调来维护它们的合法性。
- en: Anyway, I was in Las Vegas last weekend and hung out with a Black Jack pro.
    His basic strategy was to find 2 deck black jack tables, which would give him
    enough time to count cards and generate an advantage. If they reshuffled too early,
    say after 52 cards, he couldn't make money, and this was part discretionary, part
    casino rule.

  zh: 无论如何，上个周末我在拉斯维加斯和一个二十一点高手一起玩。他的基本策略是找到两副牌的黑杰克桌，这样他就有足够的时间数牌并获取优势。如果他们太早洗牌，比如52张牌后，他就不能赚钱，这既是自由裁量，也是赌场规则。
- en: I won't give away all his secrets, but the bottom line is that it didn't seem
    worth it to me. As a job, not an avocation, it didn't seem fun, or even really
    well paying. The basic card counting part of the job is pretty mechanical and
    after repetition rather easy. Most importantly, he had a very interesting time
    with the dealers. Basically, you want them to know and like you, but just a little.
    Too much, and they will catch on to your game, too little and they won't do you
    any favors.

  zh: 我不会泄露他的所有秘密，但底线是对我来说，似乎不值得。作为一份工作，而不是一个爱好，它似乎并不有趣，甚至赚得不是很多。工作中的基本数牌部分相当机械，重复后相当容易。最重要的是，他与荷官们的交流非常有趣。基本上，你希望他们了解并喜欢你，但只是一点点。太多，他们会发现你的游戏，太少，他们就不会帮你。
- en: As they have a lot of discretion, and you are hoping to make say $300 off any
    on dealer, which in the context of their weekend is not a lot. Thus, they might
    choose to deal to you with only 25 cards left in the shoe, if they like you, whereas
    if they don't like you they will reshuffle after 50 cards. A great salesman is
    one who can make customers like them so much they don't mind paying a little extra,
    and don't like to even think about what is happening (like when dupes don't care
    their partner is using them because they are so adorable). Smarts are necessary
    to make this happen, but to make it a really valuable strategy you need the ability
    to make the opportunity cost seem a lot smaller than it is.

  zh: 由于他们有很大的自由裁量权，而你希望从任何一个荷官那里赚300美元，这在他们周末的情况下并不算多。因此，如果他们喜欢你，他们可能在牌鞋只剩下25张牌时发牌给你，而如果他们不喜欢你，他们会在50张牌后洗牌。一个优秀的销售员是能让顾客如此喜欢他们以至于不介意多付一点钱，并且不愿意考虑发生了什么（比如说，偶尔的情侣并不在乎他们的伴侣在利用他们，因为他们太可爱了）。智慧是必要的使这一切发生，但要使其成为一种真正有价值的策略，你需要让机会成本看起来比实际小得多。
