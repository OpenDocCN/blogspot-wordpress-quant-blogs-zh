    a definition from Investopedia: “A characteristic of a system, model or function
    that describes its capability to cope and perform under an increased or expanding
    workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or even increase
    its level of performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands.”'

    model building. The reason is very simple; I never had to. Most of the models
    I design are for my personal trading and since I don’t have millions of dollar
    in capital to trade (yet!), the scalability requirements are very insignificant.
    Most of my trading is on the mini futures and I only trade a few contracts per
    symbol. Keeping this in mind, I don’t have to worry too much about slippage when
    I place my orders since the effect of the order book are negligible. However,
    chances are I am not going to design models solely for my personal trading during
    my career.

- en: The scalability requirement for a hedge fund for example is however, very different.
    Imagine trading a high-turnover strategy on a single symbol, for the sake of example,
    consider a RSI2 strategy. It is a very short term strategy that has a relatively
    high turnover for an end-of-day strategy. Now trading this strategy with 50k is
    feasible (not optimal but not too bad), now think about trading the RSI2 signal
    on a single symbol with 100mm; very impractical. Think how much slippage would
    affect the strategy. At time of writing, the SPY opened at 133.02, trading 100mm
    would end up being about 751,654 shares at open quote. Admittedly, I don’t have
    the exact number, but I doubt that the order book opened almost a million deep
    at the ask and therefore we would expect some slippage effect. Presumably, it
    would be quite significant and would significantly change our expectation of return
    for our RSI2 strategy.

  zh: 对对冲基金而言，可扩展性的要求实际上是非常不同的。例如，想象一下在一个单一的符号上进行高交易量的策略，为了说明方便，我们考虑一个RSI2策略。这是一个非常短期的策略，对于一个日终策略来说，交易量相对较高。现在用50k来交易这个策略是可行的（不是最优的，但也不算太差），现在想象一下用100mm来在单一符号上交易RSI2信号；这是非常不切实际的。想想滑点会对策略产生多大的影响。在撰写本文时，SPY开盘价为133.02，交易100mm最终会在开盘报价时大约是751,654股。承认吧，我没有确切的数字，但我怀疑订单簿在卖价处几乎深度达到了百万级，因此我们预计会有一些滑点效应。
    presumably，这将会非常显著，并且会显著改变我们对RSI2策略回报的预期。
- en: Now I know that few hedge funds would trade a RSI2 on the SPY alone, it is only
    a conceptual example to support understanding, and I want to point out that I
    am not saying that RSI2 is non-scalable (nor that it isn’t). To evaluate scalability,
    we need robust backtesting clearly estimating the impact of the order book, latency
    (if intraday), and other relevant factors on the returns. Another angle to consider
    is scalability across assets, following our RSI2 example, if we allocate 50% to
    both the SPY and the QQQQ, in theory we reduce the weighted impact of slippage
    and other transaction costs on a given symbol (ie. the marginal transaction cost
    per symbol is decreasing when we diversify across assets). However, that effect
    is not necessary a linear one as nicely explained by Joshua in the comment section
    below.

  zh: 现在我知道，很少有对冲基金会仅在SPY上交易RSI2，这只是为了支持理解的一个概念性例子，我想指出我并不是说RSI2不具备可扩展性（也不是说它不具备）。要评估可扩展性，我们需要健壮的回测，清楚地估计订单簿、延迟（如果是日内的话）以及其他相关因素对回报的影响。另一个需要考虑的角度是跨资产的可扩展性，以我们的RSI2为例，如果我们将50%分配给SPY和QQQQ，从理论上讲，我们可以减少给定符号上的滑点和其他交易成本的加权影响（即当我们跨资产分散时，每个符号的边际交易成本在降低）。然而，正如Joshua在下面的评论部分很好地解释的那样，这种效果并不一定是线性的。
- en: Other avenues to consider in scalability are left to the interested reader who
    can always contact me via email if they desire since I have recently paid closer
    attention to the issue myself. Furthermore, for readers with similar career desires
    to mine, remember that models scalability is directly related to employability!
