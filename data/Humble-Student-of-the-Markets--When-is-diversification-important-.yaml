    nice and the higher correlations exhibited by global stock markets is a minor
    concern, but the most valuable form of diversification occurs during panics and
    crisis episodes - when virtually all asset classes go down. That's when you want
    something in your portfolio to save you.

    it is meant to be used as though it were an acid that dissolves away impurities,

    because we are rewarded for holding it. ***The remaining risk will be risky. Otherwise,

- en: I prefer to look for diversification more analytically. For example, hard assets
    tend to perform well during periods of rising inflationary expectations, but default-free
    fixed income assets such as government bonds will perform poorly. Conversely,
    we can expect that during a credit crisis, which is associated with heightened
    default risk, prices of default-free government bonds with good credit will rise,
    while hard asset prices would be under pressure.
