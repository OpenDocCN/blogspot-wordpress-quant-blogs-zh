  zh: 国际清算银行的研究人员将经济周期划分为两个部分：较短的商业周期和较长的金融周期。以下是摘要：
- en: 'We characterise empirically the financial cycle using two approaches: analysis
    of turning points and frequency-based filters. We identify the financial cycle
    with the medium-term component in the joint fluctuations of credit and property
    prices; equity prices do not fit this picture well. We show that financial cycle
    peaks are very closely associated with financial crises and that the length and
    amplitude of the financial cycle have increased markedly since the mid-1980s.
    We argue that this reflects, in particular, financial liberalisation and changes
    in monetary policy frameworks. So defined, the financial cycle is much longer
    than the traditional business cycle. Business cycle recessions are much deeper
    when they coincide with the contraction phase of the financial cycle. We also
    draw attention to the "unfinished recession" phenomenon: policy responses that
    fail to take into account the length of the financial cycle may help contain recessions
    in the short run but at the expense of larger recessions down the road.'

  zh: 我们通过两种方法对金融周期进行实证分析：转折点分析和基于频率的滤波器。我们将金融周期与信贷和房地产价格联合波动的中期成分相联系；股票价格并不适合这一模式。我们显示，金融周期的高峰与金融危机密切相关，并且自1980年代中期以来，金融周期的长度和振幅显著增加。我们认为这特别反映了金融自由化和货币政策框架的变化。如此定义的金融周期比传统的商业周期要长得多。当商业周期衰退与金融周期的收缩阶段相吻合时，衰退程度会更深。我们还关注“未完成的衰退”现象：如果政策反应没有考虑到金融周期的长度，可能会在短期内抑制衰退，但长远来看会导致更严重的衰退。

    and economic cycles. Early in the game of Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash
    and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels. Those who have more hotels
    make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible
    into property in order to profit from making other players give them cash. So
    as the game progresses, more hotels are acquired, which creates more need for
    cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with lots of hotels
    on it) at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels.
    When they are caught needing cash, they are forced to sell their hotels at discounted
    prices. So early in the game, “property is king” and later in the game, “cash
    is king.” Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold the right
    mix of property and cash, as this right mix changes.

  zh: 如果你了解“大富翁”游戏，你基本上就能理解信贷和经济周期。在“大富翁”游戏初期，玩家手头现金充裕而酒店数量稀少，将现金转为酒店是划算的。拥有更多酒店的人能赚更多的钱。看到这一点，人们倾向于尽可能将现金转换为物业，以便从让其他玩家给自己现金中获利。因此，随着游戏进行，酒店数量增加，同时也需要更多现金（用于支付落在别人拥有多家酒店的物业上的账单），而此时许多人的现金因购买酒店而减少。当他们陷入需要现金的困境时，他们被迫以打折价格出售酒店。所以游戏初期，“物业为王”，而后期则是“现金为王”。那些最擅长游戏的玩家懂得如何持有物业和现金的正确组合，因为这种正确的组合是会变化的。

    of the bank so that it could make loans and take deposits. Players would then
    be able to borrow money to buy hotels and, rather than holding their cash idly,
    they would deposit it at the bank to earn interest, which would provide the bank
    with more money to lend. Let’s also imagine that players in this game could buy
    and sell properties from each other giving each other credit (i.e., promises to
    give money and at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it would provide
    an almost perfect model for the way our economy operates. There would be more
    spending on hotels (that would be financed with promises to deliver money at a
    later date). The amount owed would quickly grow to multiples of the amount of
    money in existence, hotel prices would be higher, and the cash shortage for the
    debtors who hold hotels would become greater down the road. So, the cycles would
    become more pronounced. The bank and those who saved by depositing their money
    in it would also get into trouble when the inability to come up with needed cash.

  zh: 现在，让我们想象一下，如果我们改变银行的角色，使其能够放贷和接收存款，这个“大富翁”游戏会怎样进行。玩家将能够借款购买酒店，并且不会闲置现金，而是将其存入银行赚取利息，这将为银行提供更多放贷的资金。再想象一下，如果游戏中的玩家可以相互买卖物业，并给予对方信贷（即承诺在以后的时间给钱）。如果“大富翁”这样玩，它将为我们的经济运作方式提供一个几乎完美的模型。对酒店的投资会增加（将以未来某个时间交付货币的承诺来融资）。负债总额会迅速增长到现有货币量的倍数，酒店价格会更高，而持有酒店的债务人的现金短缺问题在将来会变得更加严重。因此，周期会更加明显。当银行及其通过存款储蓄资金的客户无法筹集到所需的现金时，也会遇到麻烦。

    To accomplish that goal, the economy needs to have a strong growth rate. Also
