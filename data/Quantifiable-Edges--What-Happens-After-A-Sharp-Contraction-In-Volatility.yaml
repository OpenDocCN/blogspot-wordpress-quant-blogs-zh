- en: I did a study looking at situations where historical volatility has contracted
    rapidly like it has in the last 3 days. For the study I looked at the 3-day historical
    volatility and compared it to the 10-day historical volatility 3 days ago. In
    other words I divided Friday’s 3-day historical volatility by Tuesday’s 10-day
    historical volatility. A result below 1 would indicate the last 3 days have been
    less volatile than the previous 10\. A number above 1 would indicate a recent
    uptick in volatility. For the SPX, Friday’s 3-day over Tuesday’s 10-day came in
    at a very low 0.23.

  zh: 我进行了一项研究，观察了历史波动性如过去3天一样急剧收缩的情况。对于这项研究，我查看了3天的历史波动性并将其与3天前的10天历史波动性进行了比较。换句话说，我将周五的3天历史波动性除以周二的10天历史波动性。结果低于1表明过去3天的波动性低于之前的10天。一个高于1的数字则表明最近波动性有所上升。对于SPX，周五的3天相对于周二的10天的波动性非常低，为0.23。
- en: I then looked to see what the 3-day historical volatility has typically been
    3 days later. What does a sharp contraction over the last 3 days indicate you
    might expect over the next 3 days? What I found is that when the 3-day over the
    offset 10-day dropped to 0.25 or lower the next 3 days were 5.5 times as volatile
    as the recent 3 days. This is based on 1,111 trading days since 1960 – or about
    9% of all trading days. Going back to just 1999 gave similar results, as the 3-day
    historical volatility increased by 5.4 times.

  zh: 然后我查看了3天后3天历史波动性通常是什么样子。过去3天的急剧收缩可能预示你预期接下来3天会发生什么？我发现，当3天相对于偏移10天下降到0.25或更低时，接下来的3天是最近3天波动性的5.5倍。这是基于自1960年以来的1,111个交易日——大约占所有交易日的9%。追溯到仅1999年，结果相似，因为3天历史波动性增加了5.4倍。
- en: This suggests we may see some increased movement over the next few days. A breakout
    of the recent 3-day range could be very sharp.
