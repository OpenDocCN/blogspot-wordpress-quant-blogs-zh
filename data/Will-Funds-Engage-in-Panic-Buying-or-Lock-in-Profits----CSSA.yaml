    such a large run, clients are desperate to participate and portfolio managers
    are under pressure to show that they have participated. That said, one could make
    the argument that fund managers sitting on large gains will be desperate to lock
    in profits and avoid giving up ground going into year end. It is hard to say which
    will occur, but my bet is that we are due for a large move heading into January.
    If cornered to choose a side, I would bet on further strength into year end because
    of favorable seasonality and the overall feeling I get that  profit desperation
    outweights caution. So strap on your seatbelts and get ready for a wild ride!

  zh: 进入年底，市场很可能不会无聊。经历了如此大的增长之后，客户迫切希望参与，而投资组合经理则面临着展示自己已经参与的压力。话虽如此，可以这样说，基金经理们坐拥巨大收益的可能会迫切锁定利润，并避免在年底让步。很难说会发生什么，但我打赌我们会在一月份迎来一次大幅度的波动。如果被迫选择一边，我会押注进入年底会有进一步的增长，因为有利的季节性和我总体上感觉到的利润渴望超过了谨慎。所以系好你的安全带，准备好经历一场狂野的旅程！
