    and so gave us all food insurance. We paid a special food contribution (not a
    tax!), and we were all entitled to a buffet offered by 3 different private companies.
    The buffet has to include traditional American fare, as well as Chinese, Mexican,
    Italian, Korean (dog), etc.--68 mandates in all. Most people don't want all the
    choices they pay for, but as they don't pay when they eat most people do not notice
    they are paying for things they don't eat. Now, as the food budget as a percent
    of GDP in America grows, and Americans are not any healthier than other developed
    countries, people ask, hey, can I just buy what I want to eat? The government

  zh: 好像国家决定食物对简单的市场来说太重要了，所以给了我们所有人食物保险。我们交了特别的食物捐款（不是税！），我们都有资格去3家不同的私人公司提供的自助餐。自助餐必须包括传统的美国食物，以及中餐，墨西哥餐，意大利餐，韩国餐（狗肉），等等——一共有68种要求。大多数人不想要他们支付的所有选择，但是由于他们吃饭时不用付费，大多数人并没有注意到他们正在支付他们不吃的东西。现在，随着美国食物预算占GDP的比例不断增长，而美国人的健康状况并不比其他发达国家好，人们开始问，嘿，我能不能只买我想吃的食物？政府告诉你

- en: So we have 3 buffets but the same menus, no out-of-pocket spending, and no real
    competition. This is what progressives think of as 'the market'. They convince
    themselves things will get better if they have even more top-down control (single
    payer) because then they could implement technological and logistic innovations
    (cutting out the darn middle man) that will lower costs, all the while keeping
    health care employment levels and compensation rates the same. One might be tempted
    to say, it can't get worse than the status quo, but that what the Russians said

  zh: 所以我们有3个自助餐，但是相同的菜单，不需要额外花费，也没有真正的竞争。这就是进步派认为的“市场”。他们说服自己，如果他们有更多的自上而下的控制（单一支付者），事情会变得更好，因为他们可以实施技术和后勤创新（剔除可恶的中间人），从而降低成本，同时保持医疗保健的就业水平和补偿率不变。有人可能会说，现状不能比这更糟糕了，但这就是1917年俄罗斯人的说法，他们错得离谱。
