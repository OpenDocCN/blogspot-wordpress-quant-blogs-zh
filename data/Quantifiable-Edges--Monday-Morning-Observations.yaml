- en: Just a few quick observations this morning. Although the market rose last week,
    several measures of breadth and volatility remain at extreme levels suggesting
    more of a bounce is likely. For instance, the VIX made a new intraday high on
    Thursday and a new closing high on Friday. The CBI remains elevated at 13\. Worden
    Bros. T2114 also remains extremely elevated. T2114 measures the number of stocks
    trading at least 1 standard deviation below their 40-day moving average. T2114
    closed at over 90% on Friday despite the fact that the market rose last week.
    The current 90% reading still exceeds all other periods other than the Crash of
    ’87.

  zh: 今天早上只是随便观察几点。尽管市场上周上涨，但许多宽度和波动性的度量指标仍然处于极端水平，暗示更像是反弹。例如，VIX在周四创下了新的日内高点，在周五创下了新的收盘高点。CBI指数保持在13高位。Worden兄弟的T2114指数也非常高。T2114衡量的是交易价格至少比其40天移动平均低一个标准差的股票数量。尽管市场上周上涨，但T2114在周五收盘时仍超过90%。当前的90%读数仍高于除了1987年股灾之外的所有其他时期。

- en: at some point over the following few days. It happened twice last week. The
    market has been extremely choppy. If this pattern of choppiness is to be broken
    there will need to be a strong move right from the start which utilizes the extreme
    conditions mentioned above to mount a sizable rally.

  zh: 在接下来的几天里某个时刻可能会发生。上周两周都出现了这种情况。市场波动非常剧烈。如果要想打破这种波动模式，需要从一开始就有一个强烈的动作，利用上面提到的极端条件发动一次较大的反弹。
- en: As violently choppy as the market has been it is also possible that both the
    short-term bullish and short-term bearish indications are satisfied over the course
    of the week. In any case, it should be another interesting one.

  zh: 市场尽管波动剧烈，但本周内短线看涨和短线看跌的迹象都有可能得到满足。无论如何，这又将是一个有趣的一周。
