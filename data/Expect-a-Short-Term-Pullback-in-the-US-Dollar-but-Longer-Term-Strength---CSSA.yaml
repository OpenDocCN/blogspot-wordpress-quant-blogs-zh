- en: The recent dip in the markets coincided with significant dollar short-covering–and
    hence dollar strength. Asking which caused the other is somewhat akin to asking
    the classic chicken and egg problem. Nonethless, by digging deeper into the technicals,
    the commitment of traders, and just common sense economics, it is easy to see
    (strangely this view is unconventional) why the dollar will be strong for the
    coming year. In the short-term however, the dollar is bouncing off of oversold
    conditions, and momentum and acceleration are waning. The commercials in the US
    dollar index are currently holding a very low level of positions which is generally
    a bearish sign since they are contrarian. The recent move by Australia (with Canada
    soon to follow) to hike interest rates will only create more temporary demand
    for the carry trade—borrowing in US dollars to buy Aussie dollars—and I would
    expect short-term Aussie strength. Note you can buy FXA which is the CurrencyShares
    ETF which tracks this index–or you do the much more lucrative trade of leveraging
    up by shorting dollars vs the aussie currency at generate a spread of 3.75% (try
    that at 100 to 1 leverage!).

  zh: 最近市场的下跌与美元的显着空头回补同时出现，因此美元走强。问哪个导致了另一个有点类似于问经典的鸡和蛋问题。尽管如此，通过深入挖掘技术、交易者的承诺以及常识经济学，很容易看出（奇怪的是，这种观点是不传统的）为什么美元在未来一年将会强劲。然而，在短期内，美元正从超卖状态反弹，动量和加速度正在减弱。美元指数中的商业广告目前持有非常低的头寸，这一般是一个熊市迹象，因为它们是反向操作的。澳大利亚最近的举动（加拿大即将效仿）加息只会为套利交易带来更多的临时需求——以美元借款购买澳大利亚元——我预计短期内澳元将走强。请注意，你可以购买
    FXA，这是跟踪这一指数的 CurrencyShares ETF——或者你可以通过做空美元对澳元货币进行更有利可图的交易，产生3.75% 的利差（以 100
    倍杠杆尝试吧！）。
- en: With the market currently showing some bullish momentum and other risk-oriented
    sentiment indicators flashing green, the dollar is still holding up fairly well.
    This indicates that the short-term move in markets may last a few days, until
    a short-term dollar pullback would signal overexuberance.  However, keep in mind
    that the  50-day moving average has recently crossed the 200-day on the dollar
    –ie the golden cross, which is a strong long-term signal. It is not wise to bet
    against this long-term trend -as those who shorted the market following the golden
    cross in the SPY learned the hard way. Further supporting the US dollar are the negative
    headwinds facing the Euro–with many constituent countries facing significant problems
    (including Greece) with currently no good policy responses. As the Chinese face
    significant inflation and choose to cool down their economy, at some point they
    will invariably entertain the prospect of currency revaluation versus the dollar.
    This would be desirable to both the US and China, and since the two governments
    are working together, this is not an unlikely outcome for 2010.  I would be buying
    any decent pullback–looking for the 5-day moving average to cross below the 10-day
    moving average for a couple days with a low rsi2 value.

  zh: 目前市场显示出一些看涨的势头，其他风险倾向情绪指标也呈现出绿色，但美元仍然相当稳健。这表明市场的短期走势可能会持续几天，直到短期美元回调信号过度狂热。然而，请记住，50日移动平均线最近已经穿过美元的200日移动平均线，即黄金交叉，这是一个强劲的长期信号。打赌反对这种长期趋势是不明智的——那些在黄金交叉之后做空市场的人已经付出了惨痛的代价。支持美元的另一个因素是欧元面临的负面阻力——许多成员国面临着重大问题（包括希腊），目前尚无良好的政策回应。随着中国面临重大通货膨胀并选择冷却经济，他们迟早会考虑与美元重新评估货币的前景。这对美国和中国都是可取的，并且由于两国政府正在合作，这对于2010年来说并非不太可能的结果。我会买入任何适度的回调——寻找5日移动平均线在10日移动平均线下交叉，并持续几天，同时
    rsi2 值较低。
