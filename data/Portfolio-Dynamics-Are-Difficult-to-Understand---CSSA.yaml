    Rather, the variance of a portfolio is a quadratic function of its composition.
    This thwarts the intuition of most Analysts and Investors. Indeed, the nature
    of risk may be the single most important argument for the use of quantitative
    analysis in investment management. Neither Investors nor Analysts can be blamed
    for this fact. Nor can Harry Markowitz. Nature made risk a quadratic function.
    Markowitz only discovered it*.” *William Sharpe*

- en: Studies conducted by psychologists have consistently illustrated how human beings
    have difficulty with correctly integrating multiple sources of information. Even
    when factors can be combined in a linear function, human experts across disparate
    fields such as law and medicine fail to perform as well as a simple regression
    model. This problem becomes especially prevalent when dealing with convex or non-linear
    problems. William Sharpe won the Nobel Prize for simplifying an otherwise highly
    counterintuitive quadratic solution (brought forth by Harry Markowitz) into a
    linear framework. This model is known to many as the CAPM, and unfortunately the
    model required too many simplifying assumptions to make it work. Subsequent research
    showed that several of these assumptions did not appear to hold true in capital
    markets. The greatest violation was the assumption of a positive expected linear
    relationship between beta and future returns (systematic risk). In practice, research
    showed that beta was either negatively related or had no clear relationship to
    future returns and displayed more of a non-linear profile.

  zh: 心理学家进行的研究一直在说明人类在正确整合多个信息源方面存在困难。即使因素可以合并成线性函数，法律和医学等不同领域的人类专家也无法像简单的回归模型那样表现良好。当处理凸函数或非线性问题时，这个问题尤其突出。威廉·夏普因将一个否则极具反直觉的二次解决方案（由哈里·马克维茨提出）简化为线性框架而获得了诺贝尔奖。这个模型被许多人称为CAPM，不幸的是，这个模型需要太多的简化假设才能使其工作。后续研究表明，其中几个假设似乎在资本市场中不成立。最大的违约是假设β和未来回报（系统性风险）之间存在正期望的线性关系。实践中，研究表明，β要么呈负相关，要么与未来回报没有明确的关系，并显示出更多的非线性特征。
- en: 'The original Markowitz (MPT) framework is very difficult to conceptualize,
    and leads to portfolios that would otherwise not appear to be logical. Several
    counter-intuitive properties exist, here are two interesting ones: 1) when the
    sharpe of most portfolios are high, adding assets that reduce portfolio volatility
    will increase the sharpe regardless of their returns 2) when the sharpe of most
    portfolios are close to zero, adding assets with a positive return will increase
    the sharpe regardless of their volatility. If a human being were to form a portfolio
    using judgment it is highly unlikely that they would account for these properties.
    This is where discretionary managers get into trouble– they may have a good understanding
    of how to forecast returns or generate possible scenarios, but integrating this
    information is not as straightforward as it appears. This is where portfolio math
    tends to have most of its value.'

  zh: 原始的马科维茨（MPT）框架非常难以概念化，并导致了本应不会出现的投资组合。存在几个违反直觉的属性，以下是两个有趣的属性：1）当大多数投资组合的夏普比率很高时，添加降低投资组合波动性的资产将增加夏普比率，而不管它们的回报如何；2）当大多数投资组合的夏普比率接近零时，添加具有正回报的资产将增加夏普比率，而不管它们的波动性如何。如果一个人使用判断力来形成投资组合，他们极有可能不会考虑到这些属性。这就是离散管理人员遇到麻烦的地方
    - 他们可能很了解如何预测回报或生成可能的场景，但整合这些信息并不像看起来那样直截了当。这是投资组合数学发挥最大价值的地方。
- en: Despite the strengths of MPT , it is also important to understand where the
    math can go wrong. Primarily these flaws stem from the difficulty in estimating
    noisy time series data and the exacerbation of error that occurs as a function
    of generating “optimal” solutions. MPT optimization can become highly concentrated
    and inadvertently maximize allocation mistakes as a function of the degree of
    instability with inputs such as returns, correlations, and volatilities. However,
    the math remains functionally correct and is closed related to the math underlying
    multiple regression models. In the next post, I will show how the different optimization
    algorithms are related. Most share a common theme that is not clearly discussed
    in the research.

  zh: 尽管MPT有其优势，但理解数学可能出错的地方也同样重要。首先，这些缺陷主要源于估计噪声时间序列数据的困难以及生成“最优”解决方案时错误加剧的问题。MPT优化可能会变得高度集中，不经意间最大化分配错误，这取决于输入的不稳定程度，如回报、相关性和波动性。然而，数学在功能上仍然是正确的，并且与多个回归模型背后的数学紧密相关。在下一篇文章中，我将展示不同的优化算法之间的关系。大多数算法有一个共同的主题，但在研究中并没有明确讨论。
