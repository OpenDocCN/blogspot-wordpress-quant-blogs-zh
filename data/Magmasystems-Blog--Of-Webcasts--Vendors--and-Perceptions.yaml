- en: Some people have pinged me to find out why I never appeared on the webcast with
    Coral8 a few weeks ago. Basically, it was because of a mess-up by the folks at
    Incisive Media.

  zh: 有些人ping我，想知道为什么我几周前没有和Coral8一起出现在网络直播中。基本上，这是因为Incisive Media的人搞错了。
- en: You had to call a certain phone number to participate in the webcast. The operator
    dutifully asked me for my name and my company. I was then transferred to what
    turned out to be a listen-only line which enabled me to hear the speakers, but
    prevented them from hearing me. After the presenter from The Aite Group gave his
    spiel, the presenters asked if I was on the line. From my perch on the trading
    floor, I screamed into the phone “I’m here! I’m here!” … but since I was on a
    listen-only line, nobody on the other side could hear me. I furiously sent emails
    to the guys at Coral8 and Incisive Media, but all were oblivious. I finally hung
    up, called back the operators, and explained that I was one of the presenters,
    and the operator put me on the presenters-only line, but by that time, John Morrell
    had started his 30-minute pitch for Coral8\. I had another meeting scheduled for
    noon, so I had to leave the webcast.

  zh: 你必须拨打一个特定的电话号码来参加网络直播。操作员忠实地问我了我的名字和公司。然后我被转接到一个只听不说的线路，这使我能够听到演讲者，但他们无法听到我。The
    Aite Group的演讲者说完后，演讲者问我是否在线。我从交易大厅的位置对着电话大喊“我在这里！我在这里！”但由于我是在一个只听不说的线上，所以对方听不到我。我愤怒地向Coral8和Incisive
    Media的人发送电子邮件，但没有人理会。最后我挂了电话，回拨给操作员，解释说我是其中之一演讲者，操作员把我转接到演讲者专用的线路，但那时，John Morrell已经开始为Coral8进行30分钟的推销了。我中午还有一个会议，所以我不得不离开网络直播。
- en: I have to admit that I had no idea that I was going to be part of a Coral8 infomercial,
    and if I did, I would not have been part of the webcast. As a good member of MegaBank,
    I need to be extremely careful about the PERCEPTION of a relationship between
    a specific vendor and myself. In fact, recently, I felt that I had to cancel the
    recording of a CEP podcast when I found out that the people who set up the podcast
    were bringing the Chief Architect of BEA Systems to the interview to ask questions.
    Not only do I not want to be perceived as a shill for a specific vendor, but I
    do not want my name on a banner next to the name of a company whose products I
    am not using. Even if the BEA architect’s questions to me were vendor-neutral,
    having my name on a podcast that has the BEA name on it as the sponsor would imperceptibly
    tie me into BEA.

  zh: 我必须承认，我完全不知道自己将会成为Coral8的一个电视直销节目的部分，如果我知道的话，我就不会参加这次网络直播了。作为MegaBank的优秀成员，我必须对特定供应商和我之间关系的**看法**极度小心。事实上，最近，我发现组织这次播客的人将会请BEA系统的首席架构师来接受采访提问时，我不得不取消CEP播客的录制。我不希望被视为特定供应商的**托儿**，也不希望我的名字和一个我不用其产品的公司的名字并列在横幅上。即使BEA架构师的提问是中立的，但我的名字在一档有BEA作为赞助商的播客上，就会不知不觉地将我与BEA联系在一起。
- en: The SOA/Web Services conference that I spoke at a few weeks ago had no vendor
    tie-in. I was on a panel with someone from Bank of America and from Google. There
    were no SOA/WebServices vendors on the panel. I am also scheduled to speak about
    CEP at a big conference in a few months, and I will be careful not to mention
    the specific technology stack that we are using. I don’t mind being mentioned
    as a reference customer for a vendor, under the conditions that

- en: Being a member of the management layer at MegaBank and blogging at the same
    time is a tricky proposition. If you read something here, you need to be thoroughly
    convinced that I am not shilling for any vendor. I disparage all vendors equally.
    I am not like certain consulting firms, who have relationships with every vendor
    and will never render a negative opinion about any of those vendors IN PUBLIC.

  zh: 在MegaBank担任管理层成员的同时写博客是一个棘手的提议。如果你在这里读到些什么，你必须彻底确信我并不是为任何供应商做推广。我对所有供应商都一视同仁。我不像某些咨询公司，他们与每个供应商都有关系，并且永远不会在公共场合对那些供应商发表负面意见。
