    a little different. “There were only 350 people,” he says. “***They had $6 million
    in capital. Any time we priced a deal, every partner at the firm came to the meeting***.”

- en: The key quote is every partner came to the meeting when they priced the deal
    because the partners' money was on the line. Do you think that today's Morgan
    Stanley behaves in the same way when the senior directors are playing with Other
    Peoples' Money?

- en: I see two problem in the structure of today's financial services firms. First,
    rewards are asymmetric. Today, if they win, bankers make out like bandits, but
    if they lose, someone else takes the hit. If a partnership investment bank loses,
    the partners lose their houses, their cars, their kids education, etc. That kind
    of double-edged incentive system makes people far more sensitive about risk control.

  zh: 我认为今天金融服务公司的结构存在两个问题。首先，奖励是不对称的。今天，如果他们赢了，银行家们会像强盗一样发财，但如果他们输了，其他人会承担损失。如果合伙投资银行亏损了，合伙人将失去他们的房子、汽车、孩子的教育等。这种双刃剑式的激励系统会使人们对风险控制变得更加敏感。

- en: When Chesley Sullenberger landed Flight 1549 in the Hudson, he was hailed as
    a hero, but bringing the plane down and getting the passengers off safely was
    a team effort. Co-pilot Jeffery Skiles somehow had completed restart attempts
    on both engines and was also able to run through most of the procedures to ditch
    the airplane — “something [the crash investigators] found difficult to replicate
    in simulation.” And the flight attendants (Shelia Dail, Donna Dent, and Doreen
    Welsh) ensured that 150 people were able to get out of the two of four exits that
    were viable, within three minutes.

  zh: 当切斯利·萨伦伯格（Chesley Sullenberger）在哈德逊河上成功着陆1549航班时，他被誉为英雄，但是将飞机降落并安全疏散乘客是一个团队的努力。副驾驶杰弗里·斯凯尔斯（Jeffery
    Skiles）成功地尝试重新启动了两台发动机，并且还能够按照大部分迫降程序操作飞机——“这是[坠机调查人员]发现在模拟中难以复制的事情。”而机组人员（谢莉娅·戴尔、唐娜·登特和多琳·威尔士）确保了150人能够在三分钟内从两个可用的四个出口中逃生。

- en: As anyone who has spent time around investment stars knows, the kind of culture
    that is created to support them usually doesn’t lend itself very well to the investment
    equivalent of landing in the Hudson. Instead, the environment can be much like
    that which Gawande has seen in operating rooms, where a head surgeon rules the
    day and is rarely challenged. Few are willing to speak up, leading to “a kind
    of a silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians sticking
    narrowly to their domains. ‘That’s not my problem’ is possibly the worst thing
    people can think,” but it happens all the time (even in the investment world where
    people tend to be smart and opinionated).

  zh: 正如那些花时间与投资明星打交道的人所知道的，支持他们的那种文化通常并不适合投资领域的“哈德逊河着陆”。相反，环境可能更像加瓦德在手术室看到的那样，那里有一位主刀医生掌控全局，很少受到挑战。很少有人愿意挺身而出，导致“一种默许的疏远，这是专业技术人员紧紧局限于他们领域内的后果。‘这不是我的问题’可能是人们能想到的最糟糕的事情，”但这种情况时有发生（甚至在人们通常认为聪明且喜欢发表意见的投资世界里）。

- en: The star system isn’t universal in the business, but it is dominant. And often
    one of the stars is also given the title of chief investment officer at some point
    along the way, a further acknowledgment of their track record — and a position
    for which most are wholly unprepared. Oh, the part of it where they are supposed
    to opine about the market? That they can do and do well. But the real work, of
    creating an organization that builds on an array of talent and a confluence of
    ideas to meet the needs of clients? Not so much.
