    We are preprogrammed in a way that makes learning speech easy, in that almost
    everyone does it without much training. A small amount of rather degenerate experience
    allows us to make a leap into a rich cognitive system using an innate structure
    that is today still quite mysterious. In comparison, people need years of training
    to learn mathematics, or writing. It''s really a fascinating insight into the
    human mind.'

  zh: ，他表达了他们对人类习得语言固有能力的理解。我们以一种使学习语言变得容易的方式预编程，几乎每个人都能做到，而无需太多训练。一点点相当退化的经验就能让我们跃入一个富有的认知系统，使用一种今天仍然相当神秘的内在结构。相比之下，人们需要多年的训练才能学会数学或写作。这确实是对人类思维的一种迷人洞察。

- en: The old theory of behaviorism posited that people learn by overtraining, induction,
    and deduction. The state we would achieve merely by this method would be a reflection
    of our environment, which means it would be extraordinarily impoverished and show
    much more variability than what we observe.

- en: The most imaginative people are the most credulous, as to them everything is
    possible. Though unlike most leftists of the 1960s, he believed in some innate
    nature of man, in other aspects he was a typical socialist, whose theory of economics
    is merely a critique of capitalism as opposed to anything positive or realistic.
    In his view of human nature people are eager to work for collectives that capture
    all the great gifts of mankind, but big government or corporations are always
    frustrating these efforts. Chomsky thinks anyone with power is evil, which conflates
    many shades of gray. That is, ignorant foragers in the jungle are noble savages,
    even though they have little enlightenment and high homocide rates, merely because
    they are not efficient enough to affect others. Further, because the US is powerful,
    it necessarily is more repressive than any other government. Tell that to all
    the immigrants who want to move here.

  zh: 最有想象力的人最容易相信，因为对他们来说一切都是可能的。尽管与20世纪60年代的大多数左派不同，他相信人的一些固有本性，在其他方面，他是一个典型的社会主义者，他的经济理论仅仅是对资本主义的批判，而不是任何积极或现实的东西。在他对人性的看法中，人们渴望为捕捉到所有人类伟大礼物的集体工作，但大政府或大公司总是挫败这些努力。乔姆斯基认为，任何拥有权力的人都是邪恶的，这混淆了许多灰色地带。也就是说，丛林中无知的狩猎者是高贵的野蛮人，即使他们没有太多启蒙，而且杀人率很高，仅仅是因为他们不够高效以影响他人。此外，因为美国很强大，所以它必然比任何其他政府更加压制。告诉所有想要移民到这里的移民。
