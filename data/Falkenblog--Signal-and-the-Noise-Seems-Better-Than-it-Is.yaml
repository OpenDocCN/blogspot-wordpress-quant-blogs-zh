- en: There were some neat anecdotes, like about how the McLaughlin Group's forecasts
    were about 50-50, but I didn't think it meant these guys were clueless so much
    as McLaughlin was basically asking for opinion where the true probability is about
    50-50\. As Steve Sailer notes, no one wants to hear depressing statistics like
    the murder rate in Detroit will be higher than the suburbs, or that per capital
    income in Somalia will be lower than in Estonia in 2010 or lots of other really
    important facts about the future, because we take those for granted. Instead,
    we want to know if iPhones will be more popular than the Samsung phone, which
    is more objectively about 50-50.

  zh: 有些有趣的轶事，比如关于麦克劳林小组的预测约为50-50，但我并不认为这意味着这些家伙毫无头绪，只是麦克劳林基本上是在询问意见，真实的概率大约是50-50。正如史蒂夫·萨勒指出的，没有人想听认为底特律的谋杀率将高于郊区，或者2010年索马利亚的人均收入将低于爱沙尼亚，或者关于未来的很多其他重要事实，因为我们认为这些事实理所当然。相反，我们想知道iPhone是否会比三星手机更受欢迎，这更客观地说大约是50-50。

- en: In weather forecasting there are structural models that look at where weather
    is now and how its moving, and forecast the interaction.  These work well for
    about 8 days, but after that long term averages from the Farmer's Almanac work
    better.  In economics, simple vector-autoregressions that are basically regression-to-the-mean
    models work better than averages for a year, and then long-term averages dominate.
     Structural models are worse in the short and long term.  This should give one
    pause when you listen to a macroeconomist, and indeed their stock as public pundits
    has depreciated quite a bit since the 1970's heyday.

  zh: 在天气预报中，有一些结构模型，这些模型看当前天气的位置以及它的移动情况，并预测它们的交互。  这些模型大约可以用来预测8天，但在这之后，来自《农夫年鉴》的长期平均值效果更好。
     在经济方面，简单的向量自回归模型基本上比年度平均值更好，然后长期平均值占主导地位。  结构模型在短期和长期内均较差。  当你听宏观经济学家讲话时，这应该让人停下来想想，实际上自从20世纪70年代以来，他们作为公共专家的地位已经贬值了很多。
- en: For example, when I joined a bank as a economic analyst around 1987, the economists
    all remembered when their departments had a whole floor of economists generating
    forecasts on everything (employment by sector in Modesto California, PPI by commodity
    type, interest rates over the next 5 years).  By then, then group was down to
    about 8 economists, and now most big banks have one economist, and he's just used
    for PR to put on CNBC, and the internal decision makers don't even pretend to
    listen to him (at Moody's, we had an  economist and that position is still strangely
    respected; I don't remember once anyone mentioning his work in internal discussions).
    We had debates between monetarist-based models, and Keynesian models, and they
    all were no better than guessing.

  zh: 例如，1987年左右我加入一家银行担任经济分析师时，经济学家都记得他们的部门曾经有整整一层楼的经济学家为每件事情做预测（摩德斯托加州各个行业的就业情况，各种商品类型的生产者价格指数，未来5年的利率）。
    到那时，这个团队已经减少到大约8名经济学家，而现在大多数大型银行只有一个经济学家，他只是用来在CNBC上发表公关文章的，内部决策者甚至都不敢假装听他的意见（在穆迪，我们有一名经济学家，奇怪的是这个职位现在仍然受到尊敬；我记不得有人在内部讨论中提到过他的工作）。我们进行了一些基于货币主义模型和凯恩斯模型的辩论，但他们都不如瞎猜好。
- en: 'I would have liked to hear some inside scoop on his baseball model, which seems
    to have been pretty good, but I guess he figured that was too much inside baseball.
     As for his election model, it''s kind of interesting he simply averaged polls,
    a pretty straightforward approach.  Most things that work are like that: so simple
    they don''t seem really profound. It would be nice if the key to forecasting was
    something really tricky like a Kalman filter or a 100 equation macro-model, but
    I know these don''t work because I''ve seen them fail first hand. Nonetheless,
    one often meets someone with more education than experience who thinks their new
    technique will work, and if it''s complicated enough, they won''t ever have to
    admit it doesn''t.'

  zh: 我本来想听听他的棒球模型的内幕消息，这个模型似乎相当不错，但我猜他觉得那太过于专业了。至于他的选举模型，他只是将民意调查简单地进行了平均，一个非常直接的方法。大多数有效的方法都是如此：如此简单以至于看起来并不深奥。如果预测的关键是一些真正棘手的东西，比如卡尔曼滤波器或100方程的宏观模型，那就太好了，但我知道这些东西行不通，因为我亲眼看到它们失败。尽管如此，我们经常遇到一些学历超过经验的人，他们认为自己的新技术行得通，而且如果足够复杂，他们永远都不必承认它不行。

- en: Milton Friedman was a hedgehog. And he got the big picture of cause and effect
    right in a way that the foxes around him completely missed. Take just one example,
    his 1968 American Economic Association presidential speech, in which he said that
    continued inflation would not bring unemployment down, but would lead to stagflation.
    He used simple, compelling logic, from one intellectual foundation. He ignored
    big computer models, statistical correlations, and all the muddle around him.
    And he was right.

  zh: 米尔顿·弗里德曼是一个刚性的人。他正确地把握了原因和结果的大局，而他周围的人完全忽视了这一点。只拿一个例子，他在1968年美国经济协会总统演讲中说，持续的通货膨胀不会降低失业率，而是会导致滞胀。他运用了简单而有说服力的逻辑，来自一个智力基础。他无视了大型计算机模型、统计相关性以及他周围的混乱。他是对的。
- en: In political forecasting, anyone’s success in predicting cause and effect is
    even lower. U.S. foreign policy is littered with cause-and-effect predictions
    and failures—if we give them money, they’ll love us; if we invade they will welcome
    us as liberators; if we pay both sides they will work for peace, not keep the
    war and subsidies going forever.

  zh: 在政治预测中，任何人对因果关系成功的预测比例甚至更低。美国外交政策充斥着因果关系的预测和失败——如果我们给他们钱，他们会爱我们；如果我们入侵，他们会像解放者一样欢迎我们；如果我们双方都付钱，他们会为和平而努力，而不是永远保持战争和补贴下去。
