    of the recent crisis to crises in the past. In effect, he argues that the crisis
    was the direct result of the uncontrolled creation of money by the shadow banking
    sector, and ultimately took place as a classic bank run, no different from runs
    in the past, except that this run took place mostly out of public view because
    it didn't involve ordinary bank deposits. The new kind of money in this bank run
    was stuff such as repo agreements and commercial paper which played the role of
    money for financial institutions. In 2007-2008, when lenders lost confidence (for
    good reason) in the mortgage-backed collateral backing this money, they demanded
    that money back, and the financial system seized up.

    prior to the financial crisis. What did they see? They did not see the possibility
    of a systemic crisis. Nor did they see how capital markets and the banking system
    had evolved in the last thirty years. They did not know of the existence of new
    financial instruments or the size of certain money markets. They did not know
    what "money" had become. They looked from a certain point of view, from a certain
    paradigm, and missed everything that was important... The blindness is astounding.
    That economists did not think such a crisis could happen in the United States
    was an intellectual failure.

    Lucas asserts (around 19:40) that debt just doesn't matter because the level of
    debt and credit always "cancels out." He seems to think it is strange that anyone
    could even think that debt should matter, as if he's completely blind to the massive
    agony and social upheaval ensuing from foreclosures and failed businesses around
    the US and the world. Lars suggests this is "unbelievable stupidity" and it is
    certainly unbelievable, but I think maybe it is less stupidity and reflects more
    a kind of borderline autistic inability to make a distinction between some extremely
    abstract mathematical model and actual economic reality. In Lucas's models, I
    suspect that debt and credit do always cancel out. Which is one aspect of what
    makes those models quite useless for many purposes, and dangerous in the hands
    of anyone who takes them too seriously.

  zh: 关于债务及其在危机中的主要作用，链接由Lars Syll提供。罗伯特·卢卡斯认为（大约在19:40）债务无关紧要，因为债务和信贷水平总是“相互抵消”。他似乎觉得有人认为债务重要很奇怪，就好像他完全忽视了美国和世界范围内由于抵押品赎回权和失败企业所引发的巨大痛苦和社会动荡。Lars认为这是“难以置信的愚蠢”，这确实令人难以置信，但我认为这可能不是愚蠢，更多地反映了一种边缘自闭症，无法区分一些极其抽象的数学模型和实际的经济现实。在卢卡斯的模型中，我怀疑债务和信贷总是相互抵消。这是使这些模型对于许多目的来说相当无用，并且在任何认真对待它们的人手中都可能危险的一个方面。
