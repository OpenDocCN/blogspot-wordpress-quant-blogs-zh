- en: One year ago yesterday, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (1 month) ETN
    ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) was rolled out to little
    fanfare, with the exception of the [widespread coverage](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)
    that VXX and sibling [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) received
    here when the ETNs were launched.

  zh: 一年前的昨天，iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (1 month) ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX))低调推出，除了在ETN上市时VXX和兄弟产品[VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)获得[广泛报道](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)之外。
- en: VXX opened at 100.11 that day, with the VIX at 42\. 63\. One year later, VXX
    is down 68.4% and the VIX is down 42.2%.

  zh: VXX那天开盘价为100.11，VIX为42.63。一年后，VXX下跌了68.4%，VIX下跌了42.2%。
- en: 'Setting aside leveraged ETFs, long positions in VXX were by far the best way
    to lose money in an ETF over the course of the last year. Putting the 68.4% loss
    in VXX in perspective, there were only two other ETFs in which investors could
    have lost 50% of their investment: short financials ([SEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SEF)),
    which were down 52%; and short emerging markets ([EUM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EUM)),
    which fell 50%. Long natural gas ([UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG))
    and short base metals ([BOS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BOS))
    would both have resulted in losses of 48%.'

  zh: 撇开杠杆ETF不谈，过去一年中持有VXX无疑是亏钱的最佳方式。将VXX的68.4%跌幅放在心上，还有另外两只ETF投资者可能损失了50%的投资：做空金融([SEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SEF))，下跌了52%；和做空新兴市场([EUM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EUM))，下跌了50%。做多天然气([UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG))和做空基础金属([BOS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BOS))都会导致48%的损失。
- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    captures the VXX in all its futility, with a ratio of VXX to the VIX on top to
    see how VXX has underperformed the cash/spot volatility index throughout the past
    year.

  zh: 这周的[图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)展示了VXX的全部无用之处，顶部显示了VXX与VIX的比率，以观察VXX在过去一年中表现如何逊色于现金/现货波动率指数。
- en: The links below explain the manner in which negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    and other factors have caused VXX to underperform the VIX and turn in such as
    disastrous performance. All things considered, I expect VXX to perform better
    relative to the VIX in its second year than it did in its first year, though admittedly
    this is not a very high bar to clear.

  zh: 下面的链接解释了负面[滚动收益率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)和其他因素如何导致VXX表现逊于VIX，并取得如此灾难性的表现。综合考虑，我认为VXX在其第二年相对于VIX的表现会比第一年有所改善，尽管承认这并不是一个很高的门槛。
