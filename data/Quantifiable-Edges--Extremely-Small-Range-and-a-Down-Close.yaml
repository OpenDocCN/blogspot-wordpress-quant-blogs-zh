    few things to note here that aren’t evident in the above table. First, 24 of 29
    instances (86%) saw the SPY close below its trigger day close at some point in
    the next 4 days. This is quite a high number. Interestingly, the last 2 times
    it has occurred, 4/7/09 and 5/5/09, it has led to swift rises and there was no
    lower close. That speaks to the power of the recent up move from the March lows.
