    is the table of [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    of 30% or more that I update periodically in this space, along with the subsequent
    performance in the S&P 500 Index following these spikes.

- en: This time around I have elected to add an additional column that identifies
    the catalysts involved (necessarily a subjective process) in each instance. When
    thinking about these catalysts, it might be helpful to compare the nature of the
    threat and the size of the VIX spike to changes in volatility during various high-profile
    historical events, an analysis I captured in [Volatility During Crises](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/volatility-during-crises.html).
    Another useful exercise is to think about the fundamental factors influencing
    each VIX spike in the context of [A Conceptual Framework for Volatility Events](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html),
    which I find particularly useful in helping to gauge just how large of a VIX spike
    a certain type of event might trigger.

  zh: 这一次，我决定添加一个额外的列，标识每个实例中涉及的催化剂（必然是一个主观的过程）。在思考这些催化剂时，将威胁的性质和VIX飙升的大小与各种高调历史事件中的波动性变化进行比较可能会有所帮助，我在
    [危机期间的波动性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/volatility-during-crises.html)
    分析中捕捉到了这一点。另一个有用的练习是思考在 [波动性事件的概念框架](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html)
    的背景下影响每个VIX飙升的基本因素，我发现这特别有助于衡量某一类型事件可能引发的VIX飙升有多大。
- en: Of course the table below has its own set of data nuggets, both fundamental
    and technical. One interesting statistic I find worth highlighting is the relatively
    high frequency of large VIX spikes that have occurred during the past five years.
    VIX data goes back 26 years and yet more than half of the VIX spikes in this table
    data are from the past five years. I think it is no coincidence that the [VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (initially [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)) were launched in 2009
    and the inverse VIX ETPs ([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV)
    and [ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV)) and leveraged VIX
    ETPs (starting with [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX))
    were launched in the following year, when big VIX spikes suddenly became more
    common – much more so than during the [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008)
    financial crisis, the dotcom crash, etc. For additional information on the subject
    of more VIX spikes in spite of a generally lower volatility environment, check

  zh: 当然，下表中还有其自己的一系列数据要点，既有基本的也有技术性的。我发现值得强调的一个有趣的统计数据是过去五年中大型VIX飙升的相对高频率。VIX数据可追溯到26年前，但是这个表格数据中一半以上的VIX飙升都发生在过去五年。我认为这并非巧合，[VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)（最初是[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    和 [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)）是在2009年推出的，而反向VIX ETPs（[XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV)
    和 [ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV)）以及杠杆VIX ETPs（从[TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    开始）是在随后的一年推出的，当时大型VIX飙升突然变得更为普遍——远比[2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008)年金融危机、互联网泡沫破裂等时期更普遍。有关在总体波动性环境更低的情况下发生更多VIX飙升的更多信息，请查看[2014年VIX飙升次数排名第三](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2015/01/2014-had-third-highest-number-of-20-vix.html)。

- en: As noted previously, based on the data for all VIX spikes in excess of 30%,
    the SPX has a tendency to outperform its long-term average over the course of
    the 1, 3 and 5-day periods following the VIX spike. Also worth noting that that
    10 and 20 days following the VIX spike, the SPX has a tendency not only to underperform,
    but to decline. Further, while the huge decline following 9/29/08 VIX spike tends
    to dwarf the other data points, even when you remove the 9/29/08 VIX spike it
    turns out that the SPX still loses money in the 10 and 20-day period following
    a VIX spike. When the analysis is extended out 50 trading days, the SPX is back
    to being profitable, but performing below its long-term average. On the other
    hand, when the analysis includes 100 days following the VIX spike, the SPX is
    back to outperforming its long-term average.

  zh: 如前所述，根据所有超过30%的VIX跳升的数据，SPX在VIX跳升后的1、3和5日期间往往表现优于其长期平均水平。同样值得注意的是，在VIX跳升后的10和20日，SPX不仅表现不佳，而且倾向于下跌。此外，尽管2008年9月29日VIX跳升之后的大幅下跌往往使其他数据点相形见绌，但即使去掉了2008年9月29日的VIX跳升，SPX在VIX跳升后的10和20日期间仍然亏损。当分析延长到50个交易日，SPX回到盈利状态，但表现仍低于其长期平均水平。另一方面，当分析包括VIX跳升后的100天，SPX回到表现优于其长期平均水平。
- en: In summary, this data suggests that following a 30% one-day VIX spike, there
    appears to generally be a tradable oversold condition in stocks that lasts approximately
    one week, followed by a period of another month or so in which the markets typically
    has difficulty coming to terms with the threat to stocks. This tendency makes
    today’s market action even more remarkable in that today was by far the worst
    performance of the SPX in a day following a 30% VIX spike.

  zh: 总结来说，数据显示在30%的一日VIX跳升之后，通常会出现大约持续一周的可交易的超卖状况，随后市场通常需要一个月左右的时间来应对对股票的威胁。这种倾向使得今天的市场行为更加引人注目，因为今天是在30%的VIX跳升之后SPX表现最差的一天。

- en: As noted many times here in the past, the data in this table supports the idea
    of both short-term and longer-term [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion),
    but calls into question the role of mean reversion in the 10-20 days following
    a VIX spike, where fundamental factors have a tendency to overwhelm a technically
    oversold condition in stocks.
