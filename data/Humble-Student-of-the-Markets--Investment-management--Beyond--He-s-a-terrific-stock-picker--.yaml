    certificates that you own are genuine? Even if they are genuine, does the governance
    framework allow you to exercise your rights as a shareholder or bondholder in

    way. There is no one-size-fits-all trading style suitable for all equity managers.
    You have to tailor the trading style to the reason that you are trading. As an

    so it pays to use a patient buy on the bid and sell on the ask trading style.

- en: Unfortunately, many investment organizations treat trading as an after-thought
    and assign their most junior personnel to that function. Such a decision is generally
    a mistake. To illustrate my point, the gap between a median and first quartile
    manager for a US equity large cap manager is roughly 100 bp when viewed over a
    10 year time frame. Supposing that a manager turns over 100% a year (which is
    admittedly a little high but not a big outlier) but he can squeeze 20bp per trade
    from optimizing his implementation process. If achieved, this simple step translates
    to an improvement of 40bp in performance. That`s practically half the distance
    between the median and first quartile manager. What's more, all this can be achieved
    without altering the way the other parts of the investment process, such as how
    the buy and sell decisions are made.

    in place to be hired. If there is a perceived shortfall in the investment process,
    it is up to the investor weigh the pros and cons of that manager. For example,
    an equity manager who uses a research intensive stock picking process and holds
    a concentrated portfolio of 20-30 stocks will likely not care very much about
    tracking error against a benchmark (that's for closet indexers!). Analysis might
    reveal that his tracking error might be as high as 20% (one-standard deviation
    of 20% variation in return against the benchmark). Such an investment process
    might be acceptable if the magnitude of manager's stock selection returns overwhelm
    the riskiness of his portfolio, as defined by tracking error. By contrast, a quantitative
    equity manager with a highly risk-controlled process who holds a 150-200 stock
    with a 10% tracking error is likely judged to be unacceptable because of the level
    of tracking error risk he is taking.
