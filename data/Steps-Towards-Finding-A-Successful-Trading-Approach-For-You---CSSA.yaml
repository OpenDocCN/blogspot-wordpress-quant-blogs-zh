    trying to decide how they should trade. This includes figuring out the right tools
    that should be used (indicators or strategies), the time frame that should be
    employed (day,swing, long-term), and the main vehicles that they should trade
    (stocks, ETFs, futures). Success in the markets is not about finding the ultimate
    strategy. Success flows from finding both a style and instrument that you are
    comfortable with and are willing to become an expert in. Remember that all you
    have to do is find a way to make money in a consistent manner. This could involve
    only trading one strategy and one vehicle in one time frame. Most successful traders
    I have read about are specialists in one area. Even then, they don’t trade every
    day, they wait for the highest edge situations —[a point emphasized constantly
    by Rob Hanna of Quantifiable Edges](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/kirk-hanna.html).
    Think of the great predators in the animal kingdom, despite the power of a lion
    or a tiger, they don’t attack prey impulsively. Often they will forego opportunities
    to attack animals that they can probably overpower, and wait for even more favorable
    situations. They wait for the sick, the weak or the young, and even then they
    wait for the exact right moment. Unless you are highly organized and have a lot
    of capital, you should leave the multi-strategy approach to the hedge-funds or
    institutions. You have to stay focused and go for the easy prey.

  zh: 大多数交易者最好花上一个周末的时间来反思，决定自己应该如何交易。这包括找出应该使用正确的工具（指标或策略），应该采用的时间框架（日内、震荡、长期），以及他们应该交易的主要品种（股票、ETF、期货）。在市场上取得成功不在于找到终极策略。成功的关键在于找到一种你感到舒适且愿意成为专家的风格和工具。记住，你只需要找到一种持续赚钱的方法。这可能意味着只交易一个策略、一个品种和一个时间框架。我所了解的许多成功交易者都是某个领域的专家。即便如此，他们并不每天都交易，他们等待的是最有利的情况——[这是Rob
    Hanna of Quantifiable Edges不断强调的观点](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/kirk-hanna.html)。想想动物界的顶级捕食者，尽管狮子或老虎拥有强大的力量，但它们并不会冲动地攻击猎物。经常会有放弃攻击那些它们可能能够轻易战胜的动物的机会，等待更有利的情况。它们等待病弱或年幼的猎物，即便如此，它们也会等待最精确的时机。除非你组织高度有序且资本充裕，否则你应该将多策略方法留给对冲基金或机构。你必须保持专注，寻找容易攻击的目标。

    the constraints of your own position: 1) how much money do you have in your account–with
    less than $10,000 I would argue that trade countertrend and short-term will leave
    you broke 80% of the time due to commissions, position-sizing constraints, and
    too little capital relative to leverage embedded in most futures contracts 2)
    how much time can you spend trading a given time frame? If you work at the office
    all day, even if you have access or some time, day-trading is obviously out of
    the question. Even swing trading without automatic execution or a substantial
    amount of planning or discipline will be difficult—you will have to be organized
    and make a daily game plan to succeed. Missing a few exits or entries can mean
    the difference between having a profitable versus losing year. 3) do you have
    access to a good platform to do backtesting and have real-time indicator display?
    without a platform day-trading is obviously silly to consider, and swing trading
    should not be attempted either. 4) what is your personality like? If you are a
    type-A, highly motivated and highly organized person, then quantifiable swing
    trading is probably ideal for you and a good route to consistent success. Day-trading
    might require a little too much flexibility to suit your personality, and will
    probably seem more like a crapshoot with a high degree of noise and fluctuation.
    If you are a type-B, very relaxed and somewhat disorganized person that has difficulty
    maintaining routine, then trend trading should be your game. Your personality
    is suited towards having the patience to wait for and then ride out big moves.
    The whipsaws and lower win rate will probably affect you much less than a type-A
    person. Shorter-term trading will eat you alive if you do not keep records, or
    account for all the details like position-sizing, commissions, and good execution.
    Risk management will probably not appeal to you, and in the short-term arena this
    is not something you can approach half-heartedly. [A good article on this topic
    by Brett Steenbarger](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/11/risk-management-and-opportunity.html).
    Lastly, as a type-B person trying to trade short-term, you can’t just fall asleep
    at the wheel, or go through periods of inattention to your trading.'

  zh: 除了找出最适合你的方法，你还应该考虑你自身职位的限制：1)你的账户里有多少资金——如果少于10,000美元，我敢说逆趋势交易和短期交易会让你80%的时间因为手续费、持仓大小限制以及相对于大多数期货合约中嵌入的杠杆而言资金过少而破产；2)你能花多少时间在给定的交易时间段内交易？如果你整天在办公室工作，即使你有时间或一些便利，日内交易显然是不可能的。即使没有自动执行的日内交易或大量的计划或纪律，摆动交易也会很困难——你必须有组织，并制定每日交易计划才能成功。错过几个入场或离场点可能意味着盈利与亏损的区别。3)你是否可以访问一个好的平台进行回测并显示实时指标？没有平台，日内交易显然是不理智的考虑，摆动交易也不应该尝试。4)你的个性如何？如果你是一个类型A，高度
    motivated 和高度有组织的人，那么量化的摆动交易可能最适合你，也是通往持续成功的好方法。日内交易可能需要太多的灵活性来适应你的个性，并且可能看起来像是一种带有高噪音和波动的赌注。如果你是一个类型B，非常放松且有些无组织的人，维持日常规律有困难，那么趋势交易应该是你的游戏。你的个性更适合耐心等待并抓住大的行情。摆动和较低的胜率可能会影响你，但影响远小于类型A的人。如果你不保持记录，或不考虑所有细节如持仓大小、手续费和良好的执行，短期交易会让你痛苦不堪。风险管理可能对你没有吸引力，在短期领域里这不能半心半意地对待。[Brett
    Steenbarger关于这个话题的一篇好文章](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/11/risk-management-and-opportunity.html)。最后，作为一个试图进行短期交易类型B的人，你不能只是放手不管，或在交易过程中注意力不集中。
