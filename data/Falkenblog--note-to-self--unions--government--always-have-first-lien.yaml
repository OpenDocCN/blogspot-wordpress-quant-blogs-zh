- en: In the Chrysler deal, the [United Auto Workers] were unsecured creditors and
    the Chrysler bondholders were secured creditors. The bondholders received 28%
    of the value of their $6.9 billion in bonds in cash; the Union will receive stock
    worth approximately $4.2 billion, and a note for an additional $4.58 billion,
    which represents 82% of the value of their claim. Either the government negotiators
    have dyslexia and have made a terrible mistake in their paperwork, or this is
    political payoff writ large. Is this not the equivalent of financial waterboarding?

  zh: 在克莱斯勒的交易中，[联合汽车工人工会]是无担保债权人，而克莱斯勒的债券持有人是有担保的债权人。债券持有人获得了他们价值69亿美元债券价值的28%现金，工会将收到约42亿美元的股票，以及额外的458亿美元的票据，这代表他们债权价值的82%。政府谈判者是否患有阅读障碍，并在文件上犯了可怕的错误，或者这是政治回报的大手笔。难道这不是金融水刑的等同物吗？

- en: The President screaming that the hedge funds are looking for an unjustified
    taxpayer-funded bailout is the big lie writ large. Find me a hedge fund that has
    been bailed out. Find me a hedge fund, even a failed one, that has asked for one.
    In fact, it was only because hedge funds have not taken government funds that
    they could stand up to this bullying. The TARP recipients had no choice but to
    go along

  zh: 总统咆哮着对冲基金正在寻求一笔不正当的纳税人资助是一个明显的大谎言。给我找一个得到过纾困资金的对冲基金。给我找一个哪怕倒闭了的对冲基金，也要找到一个索要过纾困资金的。实际上，正是因为对冲基金没有接受政府资金，他们才能够抵制这种霸凌。而TARP项目的受益人别无选择，只能听之任之。
- en: Law is an interesting subject. The letter, intent, and popularity of the law,
    all interact in a game with a great deal of strategy. Having been involved in
    costly litigation, I know the game is anything but straightforward, because if
    you try to be reasonable in a game with someone who has bad faith, you will lose
    even more (most litigation involves loss for both parties, it's just damage control
    once you start). Further, the end-game is hardly limited to what some jury decides,
    because of the precedent, judge's decisions, the signaling, the costs, and the
    fact that most disputes do not go to trial.

  zh: 法律是一个有趣的主题。法律的细节、意图和普及都在一个充满策略的游戏中相互作用。曾经参与过昂贵诉讼的我知道，这场游戏绝不仅仅是一帆风顺，因为如果你试图在和一个恶意方交涉的游戏中表现得合理，你会受到更大的损失（大多数诉讼都会对双方造成损失，一旦你开始，就只能控制损失）。此外，终局几乎不局限于某个陪审团的决定，还要考虑到判例、法官的决定、信号传递、成本，以及大多数纠纷都不会进行审判。
- en: While this gaming is all unavoidable in a world with people, it is disturbing
    when something as solid as liability law and throws it out the window (debts used
    to have an explicit priority).

  zh: 虽然在有人的世界里，这种游戏是不可避免的，但当像责任法这样的实质性事物被抛在一边时，这就令人不安了（债务曾经明确地有优先权）。
