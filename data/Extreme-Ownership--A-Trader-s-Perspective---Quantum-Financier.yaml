    authors and retired Navy SEAL officers Jocko Willink and Leif Babin take us through
    the leadership lessons they learned through the treacherous streets of Ramadi
    (Iraq) during some of the heaviest fighting of that conflict. With some interpretation
    many of the principles in the book can be very useful to traders. Here is some

    it removed a tremendous amount of pressure from them to “do the right thing”.

    The way this usually works in my experience is that the senior trader would take
    it on as part of his platform and eat the loss if the strategy doesn’t work as
    expected for whatever reason. In order for this process to work, the senior trader
    must really believe in what is being attempted. Failure to do that will only serve
    to stifle the process and embitter the creator of the strategy. It is then very
    important to commit to the idea and to believe it can be successful in order to
    make the development process work.

    analysis, risk monitoring and everything in between the only way to make an effective
    dent in said to-do list and improve your platform is to aggressively prioritize
    each task and tackle them successively focusing on the highest priority one. It
    is also important to recognize that those priorities are shifting in real-time.
    For instance, focusing on research while a production algo loses connectivity
    would be a problem to say the least! Additionally, in a risk limit liquidation,
    affectionately known as a puke situation where say multiple algorithms are requiring
    immediate action all at the same time this becomes a matter of survival for a
    trading platform. If the liquidation isn’t handled in a disciplined and unemotional
    fashion it can lead to much larger losses so prioritization here again is key.

    all the minute details. In addition to that, traders responsible for the desk
    during those sessions must know what they are trying to accomplish and what they
    can and also importantly cannot do in other to reach that goal. It is no use having
    somebody sitting in front of a computer overnight without any power to make any
    real decisions. All that ends up creating is a lot of lost sleep over middle of
    the night phone conversations. Furthermore, many such situations are time-sensitive.
    One can’t afford to have the execution trader not empowered to make decisions
    once they are needed. That being said, it is critical to clearly outline what
    are the limits of that decision-making authority. This is one of the areas where
    I really struggle because it is often very difficult to own the result of something
    that you don’t end up directly causing. But the important part here is that it
    is one job to mentor and train those people so that there is no scenarios where
    they would make a decision that goes against the intent which in our case is always
    to make the most money possible while minimizing the associated risk.
