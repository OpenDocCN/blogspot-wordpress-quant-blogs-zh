    Our minds are designed for survival, and hence we rely on heuristics, experience
    and linear-thinking. But its important to think about these things in the stock
    market because it impacts our chances of survival in the brave new world of modern
    computing and artificial intelligence. While you look at a chart of Apple Computer,
    the computer algorithms at Goldman Sachs are  simultaneously analyzing  Apple,
    QQQQ, IBM, Microsoft, option prices, the US dollar, interest rates and a host
    of other inter-relationships. Their goal is to determine relative value, or to
    predict changes in the stock price. So while you are predicting a breakout or
    a breakdown by looking at historical patterns, they are looking in multiple dimensions
    at the “invisible” factors that affect Apple prices. Clearly they are going to
    be more accurate than you at predicting the future price of Apple,  no matter
    how good you are at reading charts. The market is a highly complex and interconnected
    web, and to look at the price of the underlying is to operate in only 2 dimensions.

  zh: 我们很难因为我们一次只考虑了几个维度而责怪我们的倾向。我们的思维是为了生存而设计的，因此我们依赖于启发式、经验和线性思维。但是在股市中考虑这些问题很重要，因为它影响了我们在现代计算和人工智能的勇敢新世界中生存的机会。当你看着苹果电脑的图表时，高盛的计算机算法同时分析着苹果、QQQQ、IBM、微软、期权价格、美元、利率以及许多其他相互关系。他们的目标是确定相对价值，或者预测股价的变化。因此，当你通过查看历史模式来预测突破或崩溃时，他们正在以多个维度查看影响苹果价格的“不可见”因素。很明显，无论你在读图表方面有多么出色，他们都会比你更准确地预测苹果的未来价格。市场是一个高度复杂和相互关联的网络，仅仅看基础资产的价格就是在运作中仅有的两个维度。

    to complex real-time intermarket analysis —beyond the scope of even sophisticated
    traders. In fact, simply integrating multiple time frames in a comprehensive sequence
    will greatly assist in classification accuracy. This approach is well-documented
    by Brian Shannon of Alphatrends, and his book is highly recommended as both a
    theoretical and practical framework: [http://www.alphatrends.net/](http://www.alphatrends.net/).
     Basically, to properly predict direction you are better off aligning yourself
    with more than one time frame, and also giving added weight to the long-term time
    frame. This general concept affects equity curve analysis in unique and interesting
    ways.'

  zh: 这种思维方式也影响着策略。这绝对不仅限于复杂的实时跨市场分析，这甚至超出了精通的交易者的范围。事实上，仅仅将多个时间框架集成到一个全面的序列中就会极大地帮助分类的准确性。这种方法由Alphatrends的Brian
    Shannon有详细记录，他的书作为理论和实践框架都是强烈推荐的：[http://www.alphatrends.net/](http://www.alphatrends.net/)。基本上，要正确预测方向，最好将自己与不止一个时间框架对齐，并且还要给予长期时间框架更多的权重。这个总体概念以独特而有趣的方式影响着权益曲线分析。
- en: When we are trying to determine whether or not to turn strategies on or off
    such as daily follow-through, we are only looking at one time-frame. Our assumption
    is that we can “time” daily-follow through with a reasonable degree of accuracy
    for the purposes of creating an adaptive approach.  However, much like the examples
    mentioned above, there is reason to believe that looking at more things simultaneously
    will improve our ability to make predictions.  In this case we can take a multiple
    time-frame approach and look at the spectrum of mean-reverting strategies, and
    ideally consider intermediate and long-term time frames as well. Furthermore,
    we can look at the factors that affect mean-reversion such as volatility and trendiness.
    From there we can use an even more layered approach by considering markets other
    than the S&P500, and perhaps even look at the individual sector or stock level.
     This is the type of approach that is far less prone to random error, and data-snooping,
    and is much more “robust.” An effect such as mean-reversion is broad-based and
    driven by strong common factors that many of us many not currently understand,
    but nonetheless exist. Detecting such shifts in the tectonic plates of the markets
    requires a multi-dimensional approach to equity curve analysis.

  zh: 当我们试图确定是否启用或禁用某些策略，比如每日跟进时，我们只关注一个时间框架。我们的假设是我们可以“定时”每日跟进，以合理程度的准确性来创建一个适应性方法。然而，正如上面提到的例子一样，有理由相信同时关注更多的事情会提高我们做出预测的能力。在这种情况下，我们可以采用多个时间框架的方法，审视均值回归策略的范围，并且理想情况下也要考虑中期和长期的时间框架。此外，我们可以研究影响均值回归的因素，比如波动性和趋势性。从那里我们可以采取更加分层的方法，考虑除了标普500以外的其他市场，甚至可能考虑个别板块或股票级别。这是一种远小于随机误差和数据窥探的倾向，且更加“健壮”的方法。均值回归此类效应是基于广泛的、由许多我们可能当前并不理解但确实存在的强共同因素所驱动。要探测市场地壳板块
    such shifts 需要多维度的股票曲线分析方法。
