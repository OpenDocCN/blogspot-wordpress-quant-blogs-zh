- en: '1) **The market is operating in compressed time:** runs are getting shorter
    as information flow is accessible more rapidly, commissions are lower, and participants
    react and synthesize information faster. High frequency, program, and algorithmic
    trading makes up most of the trading volume. This is what is responsible for what
    is perceived as mean-reversion: runs rarely last more than 3 days . Imagine a
    roulette wheel that rarely if even landed on red more than 3 times in a row—it
    would be very easy to make money using a martingale strategy. As a consequence
    fading generates much higher winning percentages than in the past which makes
    it a profitable strategy, in contrast 40% or fewer runs lasted only 1 day in the
    past gradually moving into the mid 50s this decade. The winning percentage for
    daily follow-through prior to this decade (ie a trending strategy) was lower than
    the inverse MR system in this decade– and made its money like most  trend systems
    via a higher W/L ratio.'

  zh: 1) 市场正在压缩时间中运行：随着信息流动更加迅速，运行时间变短，佣金降低，参与者的反应和信息整合速度更快。高频、程序化和算法交易占据了大部分交易量。这就是所谓的均值回归：运行很少持续超过3天。想象一个轮盘赌，很少甚至连续3次落在红色上——使用马丁格尔策略赚钱会非常容易。因此，衰减产生的胜率比过去高得多，使其成为一个盈利的策略。相比之下，过去只有40%或更少的运行只持续了1天，逐渐在本世纪初期上升到50年代中期。在本世纪初之前，每日跟进的趋势策略（即趋势策略）的胜率低于本世纪的逆MR系统——并且像大多数趋势系统一样，通过较高的胜负比赚取利润。
- en: 2) **The market is becoming more efficient:** for many of the reasons above.
    The Sharpe Ratio for all combinations of profitable run strategies is declining
    over time. Traders are confusing the high profitability of mean-reversion strategies
    in recent years on an absolute rather than risk-adjusted basis. Volatility was
    higher in 2008 than it has ever been over long periods. The Sharpe Ratio for trending
    and countertrending strategies prior to this decade was higher–partially this
    reflects poor market returns for this decade, but the trend across decades is
    lower.

  zh: 2) 市场正在变得更加有效率：正如上述许多原因所示。所有盈利运行策略的夏普比率随着时间的推移而下降。交易者混淆了近年来均值回归策略的高盈利性，这是在绝对而非风险调整的基础上。2008年的波动性比长期以来的任何时候都要高。本世纪初之前，趋势和逆趋势策略的夏普比率更高——这部分反映了本世纪的糟糕市场回报，但跨世纪的趋势更低。
- en: '3) **Run Frequency Is Also Dictated by Auto-Correlation and  Market Breadth:** 
    A lesser known fact is that autocorrelation (ie the tendency to follow through) in
    the index used to be driven by a lead/lag effect where the larger stocks moved
    first and the smaller stocks followed in sequence (See a Non-Random Walk Down
    Wall Street). With electronic trading and the acceleration of market time, this
    lead/lag effect is gradually becomind smaller and smaller. The correlation of
    the Russell 2000 and the S&P500 is becoming higher for example. Breadth and increasing
    breadth is the only observable clue of this lead/lag effect happening in real-time.
    Thus when breadth starts from a lower base and starts accelerating in conjunction
    with price my theory is that auto-correlation or follow through is more likely
    than mean-reversion. For a a complete review of the effect of market breadth,
    Quantifiable Edges has an entire archive here that is well worth reading [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Breadth](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Breadth) .
    Some additional breadth research came out today [http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/editorial/The-TRIN-An-Indicator-to-Tell-You-if-the-Market-is-82283.cfm](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/editorial/The-TRIN-An-Indicator-to-Tell-You-if-the-Market-is-82283.cfm).
    The opposite is true if breadth is absent–ie if prices are falling/rising and
    breadth is low then MR is more likely. The other contingency is that when breadth
    is extreme and prices and volumes are extreme this should lead to mean reversion
    as well. The current abscence of mean-reversion after the spectacular performance
    in 2008 is largely due to breadth factors—-in 2008 we saw a massive withdrawal
    of capital, and a gradual decline in market breadth which based on my theory would
    dictate heavy mean-reversion under most contingencies. In contrast in 2009 since
    the beginning of the rally we are seeing a return of money to the market and heavy
    and accelerating  breadth as noted by Rob Hanna at Quantifiable Edges   [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/2009-rally-breadth-without-compare.html](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/2009-rally-breadth-without-compare.html)   Thus
    it should not be surprising that MR has weakened substantially and has not been
    the dominant regime. Nonetheless at a macro-level the same principles apply as
    dictated by the theory: when prices and breadth reach extremes such as they have
    now, mean-reversion should be likely to set in again quite soon.'

  zh: 3) **运行频率也由自相关性和市场广度决定：** 一个不太为人所知的事实是，指数中的自相关性（即倾向于持续）曾经是由领先/滞后效应驱动的，其中大盘股先动，小盘股依次跟随（参见《华尔街的非随机漫步》）。随着电子交易和市场时间的加速，这种领先/滞后效应正在逐渐变得越小越小。例如，罗素2000和标普500的自相关性正在变得更高。广度以及不断增加的广度是这种领先/滞后效应实时发生的唯一可观察的线索。因此，当广度从较低的基础开始，并且与价格一起加速时，我的理论是，自相关性或持续性比均值回归更有可能。对于市场广度的效果的完整回顾，Quantifiable
    Edges有一个完整的档案，非常值得一读[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Breadth](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Breadth)。今天还有一些额外的广度研究发布[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/editorial/The-TRIN-An-Indicator-to-Tell-You-if-the-Market-is-82283.cfm](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/editorial/The-TRIN-An-Indicator-to-Tell-You-if-the-Market-is-82283.cfm)。如果缺少广度——即如果价格正在下跌/上涨，而广度较低，那么均值回归更有可能。另一个情况是，当广度极端，价格和成交量也极端时，这也应该导致均值回归。在2008年表现出色之后，当前均值回归的缺失在很大程度上是由广度因素造成的——在2008年，我们看到了大量资本的撤出，市场广度逐渐下降，根据我的理论，在大多数情况下，这将导致强烈的均值回归。相比之下，自2009年反弹开始以来，我们看到了资金回到市场，以及由Rob
    Hanna在Quantifiable Edges注意到的强烈和加速的广度[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/2009-rally-breadth-without-compare.html](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/2009-rally-breadth-without-compare.html)。因此，MR已经大幅减弱，并且一直没有成为主流，这并不令人惊讶。尽管如此，在宏观层面上，同样的原则适用，由理论决定：当价格和广度达到现在的极端水平时，均值回归应该很快就会再次出现。
