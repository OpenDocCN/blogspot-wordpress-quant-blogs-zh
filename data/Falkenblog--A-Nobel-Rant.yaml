- en: A Nobel Prize means that you did something really well appreciated. With hindsight,
    some of these are found positively harmful (note Edgar Moniz's Nobel for the lobotomy),
    and many are just irrelevant (what great insights today do we use from, say, Myrdal,
    Leontief, or Lewis?). Unfortunately, it is the best brand name in academia, so

  zh: 诺贝尔奖意味着你做了一些受到高度赞赏的事情。事后看来，其中一些被发现是积极有害的（请注意埃德加·莫尼斯获得了卡威脑叶切除术的诺贝尔奖），而许多只是无关紧要的（我们今天从那些人那里得到了什么伟大的见解，比如从迈尔达尔、利昂蒂夫还是刘易斯那里？）。不幸的是，这是学术界中最好的品牌名称，所以如果你有一个诺贝尔奖，克鲁格曼

    Crow laws, the Korean War, fear of nuclear death, Elvis...I suppose they all caused
    the prosperous 1950s. I''m not sure what, specifically, he thinks was a good policy:
    the separation of Investment Banking from commercial banking? That has been shown
    irrelevant looking at cross-country analysis, and even in this latest crisis,
    it was not investment/commercial bank hybrids that did much different. Perhaps
    he''s talking about the various Securities acts of 1934 and 43, which basically
    made brokers sign statements with their addresses, and noting they understood
    parochial laws that forbid stealing and fraud (who knew?).'

  zh: 是可以的。很多事情都是独特的：吉姆·克劳法律、朝鲜战争、对核死亡的恐惧、猫王……我想他们都导致了繁荣的1950年代。我不确定他具体认为哪项政策是好的：把投资银行与商业银行分开吗？从跨国分析来看，这是无关紧要的，甚至在最近的危机中，投资/商业银行混合体并没有做出太多不同。也许他在谈论1934年和43年的各种证券法案，这些法案基本上让经纪人签署陈述书，注明他们的地址，并注意到他们理解禁止偷窃和欺诈的教区法律（谁知道呢？）。

- en: The economy is a big, complex thing. To blame the S&L crisis on Reagan is like
    blaming WW2 on Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its long history, from the Depository Institutions
    Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, to the Garn–St. Germain Depository
    Institutions Act of 1982, to Tax Reform in 1986, created a problem that was not
    anticipated by either party very well. But they started in the Carter administration.

  zh: 经济是一件庞大而复杂的事情。把储蓄与贷款危机归咎于里根就像把二战归咎于富兰克林·D·罗斯福一样。从1980年的存款机构去监管和货币控制法案，到1982年的Garn-St.
    Germain存款机构法案，再到1986年的税收改革，都造成了一个问题，双方都没有很好地预见到。但这些政策都是从卡特政府开始的。

- en: He seems to forget that the regulators were actually punishing banks that did
    not lower their standards sufficiently. To meet Community Reinvestment Act goals,
    and goals set forth at the Justice Department, banks had to get more loans into
    minority groups, and the easiest way to do that was to lend with no money down
    based on the incorrect, but widely held assumption that housing prices, in aggregate,
    would not go down. Regulators were encouraging this, so to the degree there would
    have been 'more regulation', it would have only been worse.

  zh: 他似乎忘记了监管机构实际上是在惩罚那些没有降低标准的银行。为了实现《社区再投资法》的目标，以及司法部制定的目标，银行必须将更多贷款提供给少数族裔群体，而最简单的方法就是根据错误但被广泛认可的假设，即房价总体上不会下跌，无需首付就能贷款。监管机构鼓励这样做，因此可以说，如果当时“更多监管”，只会使情况变得更糟。
