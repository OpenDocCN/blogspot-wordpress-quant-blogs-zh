- en: One study I looked at this weekend was how the market reacted following times
    when the SPY gapped higher, never traded down to the previous day’s close, and
    closed above its open as it did on Friday. Friday was a bit of a borderline example
    since the gap was small and it came within 1 cent of filling the overnight gap,
    but the results were interesting nonetheless. Rather than use a results table
    as I normally do I decided to show an equity curve of this study. The equity curve
    assumes a 5-day exit. It may be a bit difficult to read the dates below. The test
    was run from the SPY inception in 1993 though 2/6/09.

  zh: 本周末我研究的一项是市场在SPY跳空上涨后、从未交易至前一日收盘价、并且收盘价高于开盘价时的反应，正如上周五所发生的那样。周五的例子有点边缘，因为跳空很小，它接近于填平隔夜跳空，但结果仍然有趣。我决定展示这项研究的股票曲线，而不是像我通常那样使用结果表格。该股票曲线假设一个5天的退出。下面的日期可能有点难以阅读。从1993年SPY成立至2009年2月6日进行了这项测试。

- en: 'What I see is an incredibly strong and consistent tendency to reverse and trade
    lower has been evident since the bear market began in late 2007\. This tendency
    did not exist prior to that. It is worth taking note of such test results for
    a couple of reasons: 1) To understand how the market is reacting to such setups
    currently (or in the recent past). By knowing what the market current tendency
    is you can position yourself to take advantage of it. 2) To consider possible
    implications if these kind of setups stop preceding strong negative market reactions.
    The bear market reaction has been extremely negative. If negative reactions to
    this or other similar bear-only studies stop occurring it could signal a shift
    in market dynamics and a possible rally.'

  zh: 我所看到的是，自2007年底市场开始熊市以来，强烈的反转和下跌交易倾向一直很明显。这种倾向在此之前并不存在。值得关注这些测试结果有几个原因：1) 了解市场如何当前（或最近过去）对这种设置作出反应。通过知道市场目前的倾向，你可以
    positioning yourself to take advantage of it. 2) 考虑如果这些设置停止预示强烈的负面市场反应会带来什么可能的含义。熊市反应已经非常负面。如果对这种或其他类似的仅熊市研究的负面反应停止出现，这可能表明市场动态发生了转变，并可能出现反弹。
