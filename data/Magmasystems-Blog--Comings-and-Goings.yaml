- en: In the United States, men are glued to their TV sets, watching the National
    Football League's annual college draft. This is the time when 26 football teams
    throw a ridiculous amount of money at elite college atheletes.

- en: On Wall Street, the annual post-bonus dance is almost complete. As people received
    their bonus checks in February or March, news comes almost every day that this
    person or that person has departed for company X or Y. This has dessimated several's
    company's IT departments, as the one person who knows a certain application inside
    and out is suddenly no more .... and the mad scramble for talent starts anew as
    companies try to backfill these positions.

  zh: 在华尔街，年度奖金舞会几乎要结束了。随着人们在二三月份收到了他们的奖金支票，几乎每天都有这样的消息传来：这个人或那个人已经离开，去了公司X或Y。这使得一些公司的IT部门遭受了毁灭性的打击，因为那些对某个应用程序了如指掌的人突然间就不见了……公司们开始新一轮的人才争夺战，试图填补这些职位。

- en: Just like the NFL draft, those of us in Wall Street IT sit back and await news
    to see where our colleagues end up. Such is the situation with me. I sit back
    and monitor the blogs, anxiously waiting to see where Matt, Pin, and Deglan end
    up. Matt announced his resignation on his blog, and invited all comers to bid
    on his services. In his last blog post, he said that he had many offers from his
    blog readers. Whoever the lucky company is who ends up with Matt, it will be money
    well spent.

  zh: 就像NFL选秀一样，我们这些华尔街IT人士都坐等消息，看我们的同事最终会去哪里。我的情况就是这样。我坐等博客更新，焦急地等待看到Matt、Pin和Deglan最终会去哪里。Matt在他的博客上宣布了他的辞职，并邀请所有人对他的服务进行竞标。在他的最后一篇博客文章中，他说他的博客读者给了他很多工作机会。无论哪个有幸与Matt合作的公司，都将物有所值。
- en: The bar has been raised slightly in terms of compensation packages for senior
    developers. On Wall Street, a total compensation package of slightly over $200K
    is becoming more common. The calls from headhunters are becoming more frantic,
    as Wall Street scrambles to fill positions of their dearly departed developers.
    The base salary seems to still be $150K, but on Wall Street, bonus is everything.
    Managing Directors typically make 200-300% in bonus. Developers are still in the
    30-40% range in most companies,except for the premier companies, where your 18-hour
    days might get you upwards of 80%. But, as a colleague of mine told me recently,
    many a marriage has been sacrificed in exchange for that bonus.

  zh: 在薪酬待遇方面，高级开发人员的门槛略有提高。在华尔街，年薪略高于20万美元的薪酬包越来越普遍。猎头公司的电话变得越来越疯狂，因为华尔街急于填补那些离职开发人员的位置。基本工资看起来仍然是15万美元，但在华尔街，奖金至关重要。
    Managing Directors通常奖金是工资的200-300%。大多数公司的开发人员的奖金范围仍然是30-40%，但在顶级公司，你可能会因为18小时的工作日获得高达80%的奖金。但是，我的一个同事最近告诉我，为了那个奖金，许多婚姻都牺牲了。
