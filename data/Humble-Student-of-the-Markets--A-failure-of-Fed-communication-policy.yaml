    offsets. The first offset is the unusually high degree of fiscal drag, which the
    Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates at about 1¾ percent of potential GDP
    in 2013.1 The two most important components of this restraint are the end of the
    payroll tax holiday and the increase in income tax rates this past January, and,
    more recently, the government spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration.
