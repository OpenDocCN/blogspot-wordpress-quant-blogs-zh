  zh: 首先，哈德恩指出，在过去的十年中，随着高频交易（HFT）变得突出，交易量激增，同时，股票在被再次交易前持有的时间也缩短了：

    average investor for around four years. By the start of this century, that had
    fallen to around eight months. And by 2008, it had fallen to around two months.'

- en: As recently as a few years ago, trade execution times reached “blink speed”
    – as fast as the blink of an eye. At the time that seemed eye-watering, at around
    300-400 milli-seconds or less than a third of a second. But more recently the
    speed limit has shifted from milli-seconds to micro-seconds – millionths of a
    second. Several trading platforms now offer trade execution measured in micro-seconds
    (Table 1).

- en: 'First, he offers a useful clarification of why the bid-ask spread is normally
    taken as a useful measure of market liquidity (or more correctly, the inverse
    of market liquidity). As he points out, the profits market makers earn from the
    bid-ask spread represent a fee they require for taking risks that grow more serious
    with lower liquidity:'

  zh: 首先，他澄清了为什么买卖价差通常被看作是市场流动性的一个有用衡量（或者更准确地说，是市场流动性的倒数）。正如他指出的，市场制造商从买卖价差中获得的利润代表了他们为了承担随着流动性降低而变得更加严重的风险所要求的费用：
- en: The market-maker faces two types of problem. One is an inventory-management
    problem – how much stock to hold and at what price to buy and sell. The market-maker
    earns a bid-ask spread in return for solving this problem since they bear the
    risk that their inventory loses value. ...Market-makers face a second, information-management
    problem. This arises from the possibility of trading with someone better informed
    about true prices than themselves – an adverse selection risk. Again, the market-maker
    earns a bid-ask spread to protect against this informational risk.

  zh: 市场制造商面临两种类型的问题。一种是库存管理问题——持有多少股票以及以什么价格买入和卖出。市场制造商通过解决这一问题来获得买卖价差，因为他们承担了库存价值下降的风险。...市场制造商还面临第二个，信息管理问题。这源于可能与比他们更了解真实价格的人交易——选择风险。同样，市场制造商通过获得买卖价差来防范这种信息风险。

- en: The bid-ask spread, then, is the market-makers’ insurance premium. It provides
    protection against risks from a depreciating or mis-priced inventory. As such,
    it also proxies the “liquidity” of the market – that is, its ability to absorb
    buy and sell orders and execute them without an impact on price. A wider bid-ask
    spread implies greater risk in the sense of the market’s ability to absorb volume
    without affecting prices.

  zh: 因此，买卖价差是市场制造商的保险费。它提供了对库存贬值或定价不当风险的保护。因此，它也代表了市场的“流动性”——即其吸收买入和卖出订单并执行它们而不影响价格的能力。买卖价差扩大意味着市场吸收大量交易而不影响价格的风险更大。

- en: For example, Brogaard (2010) analyses the effects of HFT on 26 NASDAQ-listed
    stocks. HFT is estimated to have reduced the price impact of a 100-share trade
    by $0.022\. For a 1000-share trade, the price impact is reduced by $0.083\. In
    other words, HFT boosts the market’s absorptive capacity. Consistent with that,
    Hendershott et al (2010) and Hasbrouck and Saar (2011) find evidence of algorithmic
    trading and HFT having narrowed bid-ask spreads.

  zh: 很难精确计算，但数据显示过去十年买卖价差减少了大约十倍。因此，按照这个标准，高频交易（HFT）确实似乎使现代金融的“轮子”更加顺畅地运转。
- en: But there's also more to the story. Even if bid-ask spreads may have generally
    fallen, it's possible that other measures of market function have also changed,
    and not in a good way. Haldane moves on to another set of data, his Chart 9 (below),
    which shows data on volatility vs correlation for components of the S&P 500 since
    1990\. This chart indicates that there has been a general link between volatility
    and correlation -- in times of high market volatility, stock movements tend to
    be more correlated. Importantly, the link has grown increasingly strong in the
    latter period 2005-2010.

  zh: 但这其中还有更多内容。即使买卖价差可能普遍下降，其他市场功能指标也可能发生变化，而且不是好的方向。霍尔丹接着查看另一组数据，他的图9（下面），显示了自1990年以来标普500成分股的波动性与相关性数据。这幅图表表明波动性与相关性之间存在一种普遍联系——在市场波动性高的时候，股票走势倾向于更具相关性。重要的是，在2005-2010年后的后期，这种联系变得越来越强。

    link, with consequences.

  zh: 霍尔丹认为，这暗示了HFT推动了这种联系的增强，并产生了后果。
- en: Two things have happened since 2005, coincident with the emergence of trading
    platform fragmentation and HFT. First, both volatility and correlation have been
    somewhat higher. Volatility is around 10 percentage points higher than in the
    earlier sample, while correlation is around 8 percentage points higher. Second,
    the slope of the volatility / correlation curve is steeper. Any rise in volatility
    now has a more pronounced cross-market effect than in the past.... Taken together,
    this evidence points towards market volatility being both higher and propagating
    further than in the past.

  zh: 自2005年以来发生了两件事，与交易平台碎片化和高频交易（HFT）的出现相一致。首先，波动性和相关性都略有上升。波动性比早期样本高出大约10个百分点，而相关性则高出大约8个百分点。其次，波动性/相关性曲线的斜率变得更加陡峭。现在的任何波动性上升都会比过去产生更明显的跨市场影响...综合来看，这一证据表明市场波动性不仅更高，而且比过去传播得更远。
- en: 'This interpretation is as interesting as it is perhaps obvious in retrospect.
    Markets have calmer periods and stormier periods. HFT seems to have reduced bid-ask
    spreads in the calmer times, making markets work more smoothly. But it appears

- en: Far from solving the liquidity problem in situations of stress, HFT firms appear
    to have added to it. And far from mitigating market stress, HFT appears to have
    amplified it. HFT liquidity, evident in sharply lower peacetime bid-ask spreads,
    may be illusory. In wartime, it disappears. This disappearing act, and the resulting
    liquidity void, is widely believed to have amplified the price discontinuities
    evident during the Flash Crash.13 HFT liquidity proved fickle under
