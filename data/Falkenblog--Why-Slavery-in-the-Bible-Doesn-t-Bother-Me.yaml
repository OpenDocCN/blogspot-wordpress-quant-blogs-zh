    is long, but it bends towards justice." Many people cannot understand how a worldview,
    or a 'real' God, could have any legitimacy today if it ever tolerated such an
    institution. I am a Christian, and while I agree that slavery is abhorrent today,
    it was a moral advance in its time. Those asserting that ancient tribes should
    have condemned it categorically are just naïve prigs.

    released. For example, in 689 BC, the Assyrian King Sennacherib destroyed Babylon
    and carried a statue of their god Marduk back to Nineveh. By 612 BC, the Babylonians
    were strong enough to come back and [destroy Nineveh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nineveh_(612_BC)),
    and the 2,000-year-old Assyrian kingdom never recovered. There were endless genocidal
    conflicts throughout the Bronze Age, so if a tribe, like the Hebrews, unilaterally

    same time—and the current study shows that they made it to Iberia, too. Though
    60 percent of the region's total DNA remained the same, the Y chromosomes of the
    inhabitants were almost entirely replaced by 2,000 BC. The history of humanity

    not merely by the owner but by a community, as otherwise, enslaved people would
    run off at the first opportunity for a better life. Conquering tribes did not
    take the defeated men home and have them work as a group, they sold them off to

- en: The feudal system applied to a continent united by a shared religion reduced
    the need for genocide or slavery in Europe. Serfs would serve their King regardless
    of which cousin won the job, and in either case, they would be allowed to worship
    the same god, so it did not matter too much. Yet the entire time, ethics were
    subject to prudential rationality. For example, ransoming captured nobility was
    financially prudent and honorable, but this principle was relaxed when costly,
    as all principles are. Thus, at the battle of Agincourt (1415), the English took
    so many prisoners that King Henry worried they might overpower their guards; he
    violated the rule of war by ordering the immediate execution of thousands. The
    selective application of principles in times of existential crises is rational
    and predictable (Cicero noted, "In times of war, laws fall silent.").

- en: Prison is an invention of the early 1800s as an alternative to corporal punishment.
    Before that, jails existed merely to hold people until their trial, as no society

    was so prominent. As late as the 1700s, 222 crimes were punishable by death in
    Britain, including theft, cutting down a tree, and counterfeiting tax stamps.
    The alternatives, such as a fine or property forfeiture the average criminal did
    not have, and the non-punishment of criminals has never been an equilibrium. As
    Thomas Sowell has [frequently noted](https://blog.acton.org/archives/83316-3-questions-to-counter-arguments-from-the-economic-left.html),
    a policy must look at the trade-offs, not just the benefits, and these are often

    underlying the condemnation of slavery revolve around the equality and dignity

    British abolitionist William Wilberforce who viewed all people as "made in the
    image of God." This stands in contradiction to atheism which cannot justify nor
