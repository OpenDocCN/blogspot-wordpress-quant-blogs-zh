    have a 3-year-old and another on the way. They want to buy a larger home with
    more bedrooms for the kids, and purchase that from the couple who are trading
    up to a nicer home in a better school district. Those sellers purchase their new

    inter-market analysis of the US Dollar, commodities and stock prices raise another
    level of concern. The chart below shows the USD Index, commodity prices as measured
    by the CRB Index in green and the correlation of the USD with the SPX in the bottom
    panel. As the chart shows, USD levels are roughly inversely correlated with commodity
    prices, which have been rallying recently. The USD is now testing a critical level
    of technical support that stretches back several years. If the greenback were
    to rise, it would create a headwind for stock prices. The bottom panel shows the
    rolling 20-week correlation of the USD with the SPX, which has tended to be negative.
