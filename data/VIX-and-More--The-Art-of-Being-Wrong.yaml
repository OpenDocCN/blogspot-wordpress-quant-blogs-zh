    should be required reading for all investors. One of the most difficult things
    to do in life is to learn from the mistakes of other people – and while Niederhoffer
    is famous mostly for his two large blowups, he is also reflective, insightful
    and a fun read. Perhaps more importantly, outside of those two blowups, Niederhoffer
    has a superb track record and is highly regarded for his trading skills. Many
    think that Niederhoffer’s blowups should negate the value of what Niederhoffer
    says. I think quite the opposite. Here is a trader we can all learn from, including
    both his successes and his failures.'

    encountered is John Cassidy’s lengthy feature in The New Yorker from October 2007

    Can Victor Niederhoffer Survive Another Market Crisis?](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/15/071015fa_fact_cassidy?currentPage=all)

    February of this year and appeared in the Wall Street Journal as [Ten Things I
