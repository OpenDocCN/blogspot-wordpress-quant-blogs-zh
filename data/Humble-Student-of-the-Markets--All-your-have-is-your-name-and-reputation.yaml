    a higher standard and more is expected of them. Each year, they’re required to
    sign off on a code of conduct that includes a clause saying CFAs “have a duty
    of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent
    judgment. Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their clients and
    place their clients’ interests before their employer’s or their own interests.”

    a shortfall in KYC at Wachovia's operation in London, which he set about correcting,
    while at the same time implementing what was known as an enhanced transaction
    monitoring programme, gathering more information on clients whose money came through
    the bank's offices in the City, in sterling or euros. By August 2006, Woods had
    identified a number of suspicious transactions relating to *casas de cambio* customers
