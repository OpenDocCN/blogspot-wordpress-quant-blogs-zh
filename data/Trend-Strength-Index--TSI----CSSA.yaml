    in a reliable way to adjust your trading strategies accordingly. We need a way
    of measuring things so that we can adjust our strategies based on a change in
    some measure that is predictive of future behavior. For example, we know that
    human beings have an internal temperature of 98 degrees–under this circumstance,
    a person behaves quite normally. However, shift that temperature up to 104 degrees
    and that same person will behave very differently. If we shift that temperature
    to 93/94 degrees, a similar radical change in behavior is observed. More importantly–and
    this has subtle implications–under most circumstances these shifts in temperature
    are caused by some environmental influence, and once the environment changes a
    person will return to stasis at 98 degrees. The body temperature can also help
    us differentiate between different species–for example biologists make the distinction
    between warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals that have different behavior as
    a function of temperature. What we need for the stock market is some absolute
    measure that helps us predict a change in the behavior for stocks/markets, and
    also a means of  classifying different species/markets.

  zh: 股票和市场不断变化，它们的行为需要以一种可靠的方式进行分类，以便相应地调整你的交易策略。我们需要一种测量事物的方法，这样我们就可以根据某些预测未来行为的衡量指标的变化来调整我们的策略。例如，我们知道人类的体温是98华氏度——在这种情况下，一个人表现得相当正常。然而，把体温提高到104华氏度，同一个人会表现得非常不同。如果我们把体温降到93/94华氏度，会观察到类似的行为上的巨大变化。更重要的是——这具有微妙的含义——在大多数情况下，这些体温的波动是由某种环境因素引起的，一旦环境发生变化，人的体温就会回到98华氏度的静态状态。体温还可以帮助我们区分不同物种——例如，生物学家根据体温的不同行为将温血动物和冷血动物区分开来。股市需要的是一些绝对的衡量标准，帮助我们预测股票/市场的行为变化，以及区分不同市场/物种的手段。
- en: I often discuss theories and ideas about markets with other people, and one
    person that I have had several discussions with in recent times is Frank Hassler
    of the blog **Engineering Returns** [http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/](http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/)
    Frank is a very intelligent and also very diligent researcher that likes to research
    any and all ideas–a trait that I definitely respect. Frank was inspired by some
    of the research introduced on the LTR (Livermore Trend Ranking) and the necessity
    for classifying stocks as either mean-reversion or trending. In the course of
    his research, Frank was generous enough to share one of the indicators that he
    created that he calls the TSI- for Trend Strength Index. The TSI is an intermediate-term
    absolute (versus relative ) measure of the tendency of a stock to trend or mean
    revert.  The premise underlying the theory is that stocks with a high degree of
    momentum in relation to volatility are much less likely to mean-revert than those
    that have a low degree of momentum in relation to volatility.

  zh: 我经常和别人讨论关于市场的理论和观点，最近我和一个人多次讨论，他就是Frank Hassler，博客**工程回报**的作者[http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/](http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/)
    Frank是一个非常聪明也非常勤奋的研究者，喜欢研究任何和所有的观点——这是我非常尊重的一个特质。Frank受到了一些在LTR（Livermore趋势排名）上介绍的研究的启发，以及将股票分类为均值回归或趋势性的必要性。在他的研究中，Frank慷慨地分享了他创建的一个他称之为TSI的指标——趋势强度指数。TSI是股票趋势或均值回归的中期绝对（而非相对）衡量标准。该理论的基础是，与波动性相比动量程度高的股票比动量程度低的股票更不可能均值回归。
- en: If you think about stocks like Apple Computer, they do not exhibit much choppiness
    in relation to the strength of their overall trend. This is what makes them difficult
    to trade counter-trend since a) they have fewer opportunities/fewer pullbacks
    or ralles b) the few pullbacks/rallies are either immediately followed by higher
    or lower prices in the direction of the trend, or an abrupt change in the trend
    altogether. In contrast this makes them much easier to trade with the trend, since
    the reward relative to uncertainty is higher in most scenarios.  Tommorow, I will
    introduce the formula for the TSI and also some results. This indicator is highly
    useful at determining which  stocks to trade with the trend, and which stocks
    to avoid trend trading in favor of a mean-reversion strategy. The TSI can also
    be used as a measure to apply to the same stock as a trend filter.

  zh: 如果你思考一下像苹果电脑这样的股票，它们相对于整体趋势的强度来说，并没有表现出太多的波动性。这就是它们反趋势交易困难的原因，因为 a) 它们的反转机会/回调或反弹较少
    b) 少数的回调/反弹要么立即被趋势方向更高的或更低的价格所跟随，或者趋势本身发生急剧变化。相比之下，这使得它们在顺趋势交易时更容易，因为在大多数情况下，相对于不确定性的回报更高。
    明天，我将介绍TSI的公式以及一些结果。这个指标在确定哪些股票顺趋势交易以及哪些股票避免趋势交易而采用均值回归策略方面非常有用。TSI还可以用作对同一只股票应用趋势过滤器的度量。
