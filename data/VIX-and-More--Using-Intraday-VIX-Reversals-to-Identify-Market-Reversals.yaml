- en: I was going to wait for the market to pick a direction today and offer my thoughts
    on that direction, but since it looks as if indecision is becoming prevalent in
    the area of SPX 840-850, I thought it might be time to turn to a tangential subject.

  zh: 我本打算等待市场今天选择一个方向，然后就那个方向提供我的想法，但是由于看起来SPX 840-850区域的不确定性正在变得普遍，我认为现在可能是时候转向一个相关主题了。
- en: '[Gio: The Hawaii Trader](http://ibankcoin.com/gioblog/), has a post covering
    last week’s action with the title, [Weekly Review: Using VIX Reversals to Spot
    Intraday Market Reversals…Over and Over and Over](http://ibankcoin.com/gioblog/?p=2773).
    As the title suggests, Gio claims that during periods of extreme market volatility
    the VIX often turns in advance of the broader markets and can therefore be used
    as a day trading tool. Unfortunately, at least to my eye, I find the accompanying
    chart provided by Gio to be inconclusive at best. To my (admittedly slightly astigmatic)
    eye, the DJI turns prior to the VIX in three or four of the five examples he cites.'

    Reversals to Spot Intraday Market Reversals…Over and Over and Over](http://ibankcoin.com/gioblog/?p=2773)
    的帖子中，介绍了上周的行动。正如标题所示，Gio声称在市场极端波动期间，VIX经常在更广泛的市场之前转向，因此可以用作日内交易工具。不幸的是，至少在我看来，我发现Gio提供的图表最多也只能算是不确定的。在他引用的五个例子中，我的（尽管略微近视）眼睛看来，DJI在VIX之前转向了三到四次。'
- en: More broadly, my own experience is that the VIX is a superb coincident indicator
    that occasionally lags turns in the SPX during periods of extreme market volatility
    – a phenomenon that I documented repeatedly during the last four months of 2008\.
    My belief is that when the markets are falling rapidly and the VIX is spiking,
    investors frequently buy puts aggressively on the bounces, particularly when then
    fear the resumption of a bear trend. Very rarely have I witnessed the VIX turning
    before the SPX during periods of high volatility.

  zh: 更广泛地说，我的经验是，VIX是一个出色的同时指标，偶尔在极端市场波动期间落后于SPX的转折，这是我在2008年最后四个月中反复记录的现象。我相信，当市场迅速下跌，VIX飙升时，投资者通常会在反弹时积极购买看跌期权，尤其是当他们担心熊市趋势恢复时。在高波动性期间，我很少见到VIX在SPX之前转折的情况。
- en: At some point in the future I will probably elaborate on this subject, but I
    would certainly be interested in hearing about the perspectives and experiences
    of other traders regarding the VIX as a day trading signal and as a leading or
    lagging indicator.
