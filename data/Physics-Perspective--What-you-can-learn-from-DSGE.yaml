    to be "NOTHING AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Its true, I'm not a fan at all of Dynamic
    Stochastic General Equilibrium models, and think they offer poor tools for exploring
    the behaviour of any economy. That said, I also think economists should be ready
    and willing to use any model whatsoever if they honestly believe it might give
    some real practical insight into how things work. I (grudgingly) suppose that
    DSGE models might sometimes fall into this category.

  zh: 所以这就是我想要在这里探索的，我会在下面简要讨论。但首先，我想说几句话关于我对DSGE模型的不满之处。
- en: The first thing is that the agents in such models are generally assumed to be
    optimisers. They have a utility function and are assumed to maximize this utility
    by solving some optimization problem over a path in time. [I'm using as my model
    the well known Smets-Wouters model as described in

    be a rather hugely implausible account of how any person or firm makes decisions
    when facing anything but the simplest problems. So it would seem like a miracle
    to me if the optimal behaviors predicted by the models would turn out to resemble
    even crudely the behavior of real individuals or firms.

  zh: 由Smets和Wouters撰写，恰到好处地，][我个人认为这是一种相当难以置信的描述，它描述了任何个人或公司在面对除了最简单问题时的决策方式。因此，如果模型预测的最优行为即使是以粗糙的方式，也与真实个体或公司的行为相类似，那对我来说简直就是一个奇迹。
- en: Having said that, if I try to be generous, I can suppose that maybe, just maybe,
    the actual behaviour of people, while it isn't optimizing anything, might in the
    aggregate come out to something that isn't at least too far away from the optimal
    behavior, at least in some cases. I would guess there must be armies of economists
    out there collecting data on just this question, comparing the actions of real
    individuals and firms to the optimal predictions of the models. Maybe it isn't
    always bad. If I twist my arm, I can accept that this way of treating decision
    making as optimization sometimes lead to interesting insights (for people facing
    very smple decisions, this would of course be more likely).
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 说了这么多，如果我试图宽容一点，我可以说也许，只是也许，人们实际的 behavior，尽管它并没有在优化什么，但在总体上可能与最优行为相差不会太远，至少在某些情况下是这样的。我猜测一定有大批的经济学家在收集关于这个问题的数据，将真实个体和公司的行为与模型的最优预测进行比较。也许这并不总是坏事。如果我要扭曲我的手臂，我可以接受这种将决策视为优化的处理方式有时会带来有趣的洞察（对于面临非常简单决策的人来说，这当然更有可能）。
- en: The second thing I find bad about DSGE models is their use of the so-called
    representative agent. In the Smets-Wouters model, for example, there is essentially
    one representative consumer who makes decisions regarding labor and consumption,
    and then one representative firm which makes decisions on investment, etc. If
    you read the paper you will see it mention "a continuum of households" indexed
    by a continuous parameter, and this makes it seem at first like there is actually
    an infinite number of agents. Not really, as the index only refers to the kind
    of labor. Each agent makes decisions independently to optimize their utility;
    there are no interactions between the agents, no one can conduct a trade with
    another or influence their behavior, etc. So in essence there is really just one
    representative laborer and one representative firm, who interact with one another
    in the market. This I also find wholly unconvincing as the real economy emerges
    out of the complex interactions of millions of agents doing widely different things.
    Modelling an economy like this seems like modelling the flow of a river by thinking
    about the behaviour of a single representative water molecule, bouncing along
    the river bed, rather then thinking about the interactions of many which create
    pressure, eddies, turbulence, waves and so on. It seems highly unlikely to be
    very instructive.

  zh: 我认为DSGE模型第二个不好的方面是它们使用了所谓的代表性代理人。例如，在Smets-Wouters模型中，本质上存在一个代表性的消费者，他负责劳动和消费决策，然后一个代表性的公司负责投资等决策。如果你阅读这篇论文，你会看到它提到“由连续参数索引的大量家庭”，这乍一看好像实际上有无穷多个代理人。实际上并非如此，因为索引仅指的是劳动种类。每个代理人独立做出决策以优化他们的效用；代理人间没有互动，没有人能与另一个人进行交易或影响他们的行为等。所以本质上实际上只有一个代表性的劳动者和一个代表性的公司，他们在市场中相互互动。这也让我觉得完全不可信，因为真实经济是从数百万个做不同事情的代理人的复杂互动中产生的。像这样建模经济似乎就像通过考虑单个代表性的水分子在河床上的行为来模拟河流流动，而不是考虑许多分子的相互作用，这些相互作用产生压力、漩涡、湍流、波浪等。这似乎非常不太可能非常有教益。
- en: But again, let me be generous. Perhaps, in some amazing way, this unbelievably
    crude approximation might sometimes give you some shred of insight. Maybe you
    can get lucky and find that a collective outcome can be understood by simply averaging
    over the behaviors of the many individuals. In situations where people do make
    up their own minds, independently and by seeking their own information, this might
    work. Perhaps this is how people behave in response to their perceptions of the
    macroeconomy, although it seems to me that what they hear from others, what they
    read and see in the media, probably has a huge effect and so they don't act independently
    at all.

  zh: 但是再次，让我大度一点。也许，以某种令人惊奇的方式，这个不可思议的粗略近似有时可能会给你一些启示。也许你可以侥幸发现，通过简单地平均许多个体的行为，可以理解集体结果。在人们确实独立做决定并寻求自己的信息的情况下，这可能有效。也许人们就是这样对宏观经济的感知做出反应的，尽管我认为他们从别人那里听到的、在媒体上看到的东西可能产生巨大的影响，所以他们根本就不独立行动。
- en: But maybe you can still learn something from this approximation, sometimes.
    Does anyone out there know if there is research exploring this matter of when
    or under what conditions the representative agent approximation is OK because
    people DO act independently? I'm sure this must exist and it would be interesting
    to know more about it. I guess the RBC crowd must have an extensive program studying
    the empirical limits to the applicability of this approximation?

  zh: 但是也许你仍然可以从这种近似中了解到一些东西，有时候。外面的人有没有人知道有没有研究探索在什么情况下代表性代理人的近似是可行的，因为人们确实独立行动？我确信这肯定存在，并希望了解更多关于这方面的信息。我猜RBC团队肯定有一个广泛的研究项目，研究这种近似应用的实证限制？
- en: So, those are my two biggest reasons for finding it hard to believe the DSGE
    framework. To these I might add a disbelief that the agents in economy do rapidly
    find their way to an equilibrium in which "production equals demand by households
    for consumption and investment and the government." We might stay well away from
    that point, and things might generally change so quickly that no equilibrium ever
    comes about. But let's ignore that. Maybe we're lucky and the equilibrium does
    come about.

  zh: 所以，这就是我发现很难相信DSGE框架的两个最大原因。我可能会再加上一个信念，即经济中的代理商迅速找到一种均衡，其中“产出等于家庭对消费和投资的需求以及政府的需求”。我们可能离那个点还很远，事情可能会变化得如此之快，以至于从未实现过均衡。但让我们忽略这一点。也许我们很幸运，均衡确实实现了。

    the Smets-Wouters model, assume that the representative agents have rational expectations,
    i.e. they process information perfectly and have a wholly unbiased view of future
    possibilities. What this paper does is to relax that assumption in a DSGE model,
    assuming instead that people have more realistic "natural" or "intuitive expectations."
    Look at the empirical literature and you find that there's lots of evidence that
    investors and people of all kinds tend to overestimate recent trends in time series
    and expect them to continue. This paper explores some of this empirical literature,
    but then goes to its main purpose -- to include these trend following expectations
    into a DSGE model.

  zh: 由 Andreas Fuster, David Laibson, 和 Brock Mendel 撰写。大多数DSGE模型，包括Smets-Wouters模型，都假设代表性代理人有理性预期，即他们完美地处理信息，对未来可能性有一个完全无偏的观点。这篇论文所做的就是在一个DSGE模型中放宽这个假设，转而假设人们的预期更加现实“自然”或“直觉”。看看实证文献，你会发现有很多证据表明投资者和各种各样的人倾向于高估时间序列最近的趋势，并预期它们会继续。这篇论文探讨了其中一些实证文献，但接着转到其主要目的——将这种趋势跟随的预期纳入DSGE模型。

- en: '.....we embed natural expectations in a simple dynamic macroeconomic model
    and compare the simulated properties of the model to the available empirical evidence.
    The model’s predictions match many patterns observed in macroeconomic and financial
    time series, such as high volatility of asset prices, predictable up‐and‐down
    cycles in equity returns, and a negative relationship between current consumption

- en: Standard DSGE models with fully-rational expectations have difficulty producing
    large swings in house prices and household debt that resemble the patterns observed
    in many industrial countries over the past decade. We show that the introduction
    of simple moving-average forecast rules for a subset of agents can significantly
    magnify the volatility and persistence of house prices and household debt relative
    to otherwise similar model with fully-rational expectations. We evaluate various
    policy actions that might be used to dampen the resulting excess volatility, including
    a direct response to house price growth or credit growth in the central bank’s
    interest rate rule, the imposition of a more restrictive loan-to-value ratio,
    and the use of a modified collateral constraint that takes into account the borrower’s
    wage income. Of these, we find that a debt-to-income type constraint is the most
    effective tool for dampening overall excess volatility in the model economy.
