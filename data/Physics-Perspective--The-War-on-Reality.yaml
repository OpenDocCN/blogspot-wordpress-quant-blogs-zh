    which targeted the private intelligence firm HBGary Federal.  That hack yielded
    75,000 e-mails.  It revealed, for example, that Bank of America approached the
    Department of Justice over concerns about information that WikiLeaks had about
    it.  The Department of Justice in turn referred Bank of America to the lobbying

    brought in to find a way to undermine the credibility of WikiLeaks and the journalist
    Glenn Greenwald (who recently broke the story of Edward Snowden’s leak of the
    N.S.A.’s Prism program),  because of Greenwald’s support for WikiLeaks. Specifically,
    the plan called for actions to “sabotage or discredit the opposing organization”
    including a plan to submit fake documents and then call out the error. As for
    Greenwald, it was argued that he would cave “if pushed” because he would “choose

    real, and resembles in some ways the employment of “Psyops” (psychological operations),
    which as most students of recent American history know, have been part of the
    nation’s military strategy for decades. The military’s “Unconventional Warfare
    Training Manual” defines Psyops as “planned operations to convey selected information
    and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective
    reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations,
    groups, and individuals.” In other words, it is sometimes more effective to deceive
    a population into a false reality than it is to impose its will with force or
    conventional weapons.  Of course this could also apply to one’s own population
    if you chose to view it as an “enemy” whose “motives, reasoning, and behavior”
    needed to be controlled.
