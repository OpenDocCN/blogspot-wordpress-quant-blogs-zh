- en: If you wanted to find an example in your investment textbook to illustrate “VIX
    Mean Reversion,” last week would be a classic case study.  After soaring 75% in
    the week ended March 2^(nd), the VIX snapped back 24% this week, so that it now
    sits comfortably between its 10 and 20 day SMAs.

  zh: 如果您想在您的投资教材中找到一个例子来说明“VIX均值回归”，上周将是一个经典案例。在截至3月2日的那一周，VIX飙升了75%，而本周回调了24%，因此现在它舒适地位于其10和20日SMA之间。
- en: Perhaps surprising to some, this 24% drop is still less of a move than the VIX
    drops in each of the three previous instances in which the VIX Weekly Sentiment
    Indicator (VWSI) was at -10, as I discussed [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vwsi-at-10.html).  It
    is enough of a move, however, for the current week’s VWSI to return to a neutral
    reading of zero.  This roughly translates as the odds times the magnitude of another
    VIX spike are about the same as the odds times the magnitude of continued subsidence
    over the coming week.  Said another way, there is a higher probability that the
    VIX will be lower on March 16, *but* if the VIX makes a significant move in the
    coming week, that move is more likely to be up than down.

  zh: 对于一些人来说，这24%的下跌仍然比VIX在VIX周情绪指数（VWSI）为-10时的前三次下跌要小，正如我上周所讨论的那样。然而，这足以使本周的VWSI恢复到中性读数零。这大致相当于另一个VIX飙升的可能性与接下来一周持续下降的可能性的概率乘以幅度相同。换句话说，VIX
    在3月16日更有可能下跌，*但是* 如果VIX在接下来的一周内有显著的波动，那么这种波动更有可能是向上的。

    the spike strategy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/four-ways-to-play-vix-options-following.html),
    this looks like a good time to start taking those profits.  Keep in mind, however,
    that the VIX has a [tendency to drop](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-performance-during-options.html)
    during options expiration.  With the 10 day SMA of total put to call ratio currently
    sitting at 1.28, you can safely assume that it will need a [Sherpa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa)
    to stay at that altitude, suggesting that the market is poised to move upward
    and the VIX may have another leg down this week.

    [夏尔巴](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa) 才能保持在这个高度上，这表明市场有望上涨，而VIX本周可能会再次下跌。
