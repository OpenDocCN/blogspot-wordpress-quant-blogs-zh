- en: Yesterday, in [VIX Sets Two New Records](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/vix-sets-two-new-records.html),
    I suggested that it was coming, but I never expected it to happen in such dramatic
    fashion.

  zh: 昨天，在[VIX创两项新纪录](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/vix-sets-two-new-records.html)一文中，我曾暗示过这种情况即将到来，但我从未想过它会以如此戏剧性的方式发生。
- en: In what I believe is an unprecedented move, the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    collapsed today without any movement in the front month VIX futures.

  zh: 在我看来，这是一个前所未有的举动，[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)今天崩溃了，而前端月份VIX期货没有任何变动。
- en: 'For those who are fixated on the cash VIX and the first two months of VIX futures,
    the movement in the November through May VIX futures chronicled below probably
    looks unremarkable, as proportional as it is, but that is exactly the point: the
    VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    almost never moves in uniform proportions. Typically the front month moves the
    most, the second month may move half as month as the front month, the third month
    half as much as the second month and so on. See the links at the bottom for some
    examples.'

  zh: 对于那些专注于现金VIX和VIX期货的前两个月的人来说，下面记录的11月到5月VIX期货的变动可能看起来并不引人注目，尽管它按比例来说是这样的，但这就是问题的关键：VIX
    [期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)几乎从不以统一的比例移动。通常前端月份移动最多，第二个月可能移动前端月份的一半，第三个月移动第二个月的一半，依此类推。一些例子见文末链接。
- en: Today the cash VIX gained 0.14 points (to close at 19.07) and the front month
    VIX futures held steady at 20.65, indicating that market participants see the
    likely October settlement for the VIX one week from tomorrow at about 1.58 points
    above the current level.

  zh: 今天现金VIX上涨了0.14点（收盘价为19.07），而前端月份VIX期货保持在20.65不变，表明市场参与者认为下周二VIX的10月结算价将比当前水平高出约1.58点。
- en: The really interesting part is that at the same time the consensus of opinion
    is calling for a short-term rise in the VIX, there was an almost audible sigh
    of, “Oops, we have this one wrong…” when it comes to the longer-term outlook for
    the VIX.

  zh: 真正有趣的是，与此同时，舆论共识预期VIX短期将会上升，但当涉及到VIX的长期前景时，却有一种几乎可以听到的，“哦，不，我们搞错了…”的叹息。

  zh: 昨天我认为我走在了边缘，当我重申了过去几个月一致的观点：
- en: '*“I do believe that when estimates of near-term and long-term volatility show
    a record degree of divergence, some considerable opportunities are presented.
    As I have spelled out in a number of instances lately, my thinking has been that
    the back month volatility will likely collapse in order to bring the present and
    the future back into line. There has been some evidence of that happening during
    the past two days, but I anticipate that long-term volatility expectations will
    continue to decline.”*'

  zh: '*“我相信当短期和长期波动率的估计显示出记录性的分歧时，会带来一些相当大的机会。正如我最近在多个场合所阐述的，我的想法是远月波动率可能会崩溃，以使现在和未来重回正轨。过去两天已经有一些证据表明这种情况正在发生，但我预计长期波动率预期将继续下降。”*'
- en: Today it looks as if I picked up quite a few converts. Now the question becomes
    one of how low the distant month volatility in the VIX futures will fall. Back
    in April it went as low as the 23s. Today the distant month VIX futures dipped
    below the 30 level for the first time since June. The May 2011 futures are already
    down 2.85 points (8.7%) this month and if they are to match April’s levels, there
    are still another 6 points left to fall.

  zh: 今天看来我赢得了不少信徒。现在问题变成了远月VIX期货中的波动率会跌得多低。去年4月它曾低至20多一点。今天远月VIX期货自6月以来首次跌破30点。2011年5月的期货本月已经下跌了2.85点（8.7%），如果它们要达到4月的水平，还有6点左右的跌幅。
