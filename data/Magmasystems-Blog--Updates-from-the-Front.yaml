- en: It has been difficult for me to get the proper motivation to blog. These past
    few weeks have been like a punch to the gut of anyone who is working in the financial
    services industry. Over the past few weeks, we have seen friends, colleagues and
    relationships dissolve, as the capital markets sector has undergone a painful
    consolidation. And as managers, it has been especially painful to deliver bad
    news to some of the very hard workers who we have collaborated with over the past
    several years.

  zh: 这段时间对我来说很难找到写博客的动机。过去几周对任何在金融服务行业工作的人来说都像是一记重拳。在过去的一段时间里，我们看着朋友、同事和关系一个个消解，因为资本市场经历了一次痛苦的整合。作为管理者，在过去几年里与一些非常努力工作的人合作，然后向他们传达坏消息，这尤其痛苦。
- en: I am hopeful that in adversity comes new opportunities for my former colleagues.
    The capital markets sector is not the be-all and end-all in jobs, and there are
    plenty of opportunities out there for good technical people. As I have said before
    here ... Always Be Coding. Keep your technical skills sharp. Get out of your offices,
    read blogs, go to MeetUps, start to code that great new app.

  zh: 我乐观地认为，在逆境中我的前同事们会找到新的机会。资本市场并不是工作的全部，对于优秀的技术人员来说，外面有很多机会。正如我以前在这里说过...永远在编码。保持你的技术技能精湛。走出办公室，阅读博客，参加MeetUp，开始编写那个伟大的新应用程序。
- en: I want to thank my team ... SW, HH, FW, JW, PJ, and JR ... for taking the wisps
    of smoke and turning them into an application which we hope will signal a new
    class of applications in my firm for capturing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing
    real-time data flows.

  zh: 我想感谢我的团队... SW、HH、FW、JW、PJ、JR... 感谢他们将一丝丝烟雾变成了一个我们希望能标志着公司在捕捉、清洗、分析和可视化实时数据流方面新一代应用程序的应用。
- en: I also want to thank the vendors who have made this year successful for the
    CEP team. We have given Coral8 much deserved grief at times, but we are confident
    that with the new technical management, they will deliver some great things to
    us in 2009.

  zh: 我还要感谢那些让CEP团队今年取得成功的供应商。我们过去有时对Coral8发过牢骚，但我们相信，有了新的技术管理，他们会在2009年给我们带来一些很棒的东西。
- en: On a personal note, in addition to heading up the CEP team, I have just taken
    over the role of Chief Architect and Chief Strategist for Equities (a title that
    reads better than it is), and I have a new team reporting into me. I have taken
    over the role of my former boss, but you won't find any gala press releases that
    trumpet this appointment.

  zh: 顺便说一下，除了领导CEP团队，我还刚刚接管了股票部门的首席架构师和首席策略师的角色（这个头衔听起来比实际更好），并且我有一个新的团队向我汇报。我接过了我前上司的角色，但你们不会找到任何庆祝这一任命的盛大新闻稿。
- en: Does this mean that my company will turn into a 100% Microsoft shop, with every
    application tied into CEP? No, not really.

  zh: 这意味着我的公司会变成一个100%的微软商店，每个应用程序都绑定到CEP吗？不，实际上不是。
- en: The title of Chief Architect means a lot of different things in a lot of different
    companies. In my company, it means dividing my time into interesting things (engaging
    new vendors and technologies, doing POC's, and trying to convince the business
    to come up with the budget to follow through on the more worthwhile POC's), and
    more mundane things (like doing roadmaps, pursuing system retirements, trying
    to consolidate various efforts, etc). It also means hobnobbing with my fellow
    wizards in the other divisions (Fixed Income, Munis, Transaction Services, Retail
    Banking) and trying to overcome the traditional silos to come up with consolidated
    efforts and cost savings in these difficult times. I dare say that the words "Process
    Re-engineering" and "Cost Savings" are a lot more important than "Revenue Building"
    in these times.

  zh: 首席架构师的头衔在许多不同的公司里意味着很多不同的事情。在我公司，这意味着我将时间分配给有趣的事情（如接触新的供应商和科技、进行POC测试、试图说服业务部门为更有价值的POC测试拨出预算），以及更平凡的事情（如制定路线图、推进系统退役、尝试整合各项努力等）。它还意味着与其他部门（固定收益、市政、交易服务、零售银行）的同行巫师们打交道，并试图克服传统的孤岛效应，以在困难时期产生整合努力和节约成本。我敢说，在当前时期，“流程再工程”和“节约成本”这两个词比“收入建设”更重要。
- en: It also means that I need to take a sobering look at Microsoft technologies.
    One of the reasons I was hired into my company was to help the former Chief Architect
    push Microsoft technologies throughout my firm. However, I like to think that
    I will not be a shill for any company. Microsoft will have to prove themselves
    to be worthy alongside the reams of Java infrastructure that we employ. I would
    also like to think that I can use my new powers for good instead of evil, and
    that I will be able to push Microsoft to pay more attention to the capital markets
    sector.

  zh: 这也意味着我需要对微软技术进行冷静的审视。我被招聘到公司的其中一个原因是为了帮助前首席架构师将微软技术推广到我们公司。然而，我不想成为任何公司的代言人。微软需要证明他们与其他我们使用的众多Java基础设施一样值得信赖。我也希望我能将我的新权力用于正义而非邪恶，并且我能促使微软更加关注资本市场领域。
- en: Who would have thought that in the span of one year, Merrill, Wachovia, Bear,
    Lehman, and WAMU would be gone, and GS and Morgan Stanley would be turned into
    bank holding companies?

- en: I have no idea what 2009 will bring. All of the news reports indicate that 2009
    will be as rough as 2008\. But we all need to stay focused so that, when we come
    out of the muck and mire in (hopefully) 2010, we can all hit the ground running.

  zh: 我不知道2009年会带来什么。所有新闻报道都表明，2009年将和2008年一样艰难。但我们都需要保持专注，这样我们才能在（希望是）2010年走出困境后，重新出发。
