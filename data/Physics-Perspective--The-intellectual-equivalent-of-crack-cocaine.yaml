    Philosophy, i.e. that branch of modern philosophy/literary criticism typically
    characterized by a, shall we say, less than wholehearted commitment to clarity
    and simplicity of expression. The genre is represented in the libraries by reams
    of apparently meaningless prose, the authors of which claim to get at truths that
    would otherwise be out of reach of ordinary language. Here''s a nice example,
    the product of the subtle mind of one Felix Guattari:'

  zh: 英国历史学家杰弗里·艾尔顿曾将后现代主义哲学称为：“即现代哲学/文学批评的一个分支，通常以一种，我们怎么说呢，对清晰和表达的简洁性不是全心全意地承诺著称。这一流派在图书馆里以成堆的似乎毫无意义的散文为代表，其作者声称能够用这些散文触及到用普通语言无法触及的真理。这里有一个很好的例子，是菲利克斯·瓜塔里（Felix
    Guattari）那精妙绝伦的头脑的产物：
- en: '“We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear
    signifying links or archi-writing, depending on  the author, and this multireferential,
    multi-dimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality,
    the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove
    us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of
    the ontological binarism we criticised previously.”'

  zh: “我们可以清楚地看到，在作者不同的情况下，线性符号链或原初写作之间并没有单向对应关系，这种多参照系、多维度的机械催化。对称的规模、横贯性、他们扩张的病理非话语特征：所有这些维度都让我们远离排除中间的逻辑，并加强了我们之前批评过的关于存在二元论的立场。”
- en: I'm with Elton. This writer, it seems to me, is up to no good, trying to pull
    the wool over the reader's eyes, using confusion as a weapon to persuade the reader
    of his superior insight. You read it, you don't quite get it (or even come close
    to getting it), and it is then tempting to conclude that whatever he is saying,
    as it is beyond your vision, must be exceptionally deep or subtle or complex,
    too much for you to grasp.

  zh: 我同意艾尔顿的观点。在我看来，这位作家似乎没有安好心，试图蒙蔽读者的双眼，利用混乱作为武器，让读者相信他的深刻见解。你读后可能并不能完全理解（或者甚至接近理解），此时你可能会得出这样的结论：无论他在说些什么，既然它超出了你的理解范围，那它必定非常深刻或微妙或复杂，超出了你的理解能力。
- en: You need some self confidence to come instead to the other logically possible
    conclusion -- that the text is actually purposeful nonsense, all glitter and no
    content, an affront against the normal, productive use of language for communication,
    "crack cocaine" as the writer gets the high that comes from appearing deep and
    earning accolades without putting in the hard work to actually write something
    that is insightful.

  zh: 你需要一些自信心，才能得出另一个逻辑上可能的结论——即文本实际上是有意为之的胡言乱语，华而不实，内容空洞，是对语言正常、富有成效的交际用途的挑战，“可卡因”让作者体会到那种似乎深刻并无需付出艰苦努力就能获得赞誉的快感。

    philosophy and there may be more to the thinking of some of its representatives

    one has rivalled his record. It is that almost no one has seriously tried to emulate
    his investment style. The herd instinct is powerful, even dominant, among asset

- en: If he is a genius, it is the genius of simplicity. No special or original insight
    is needed to reach his appreciation of the nature of business success. Nor is
    it difficult to recognise that companies such as American Express, Coca-Cola,
    IBM, Wells Fargo, and most recently [Heinz](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/292eab28-76c5-11e2-8569-00144feabdc0.html
    "Heinz is a staple of the Buffett strategy - FT.com") – Berkshire’s largest holdings
    – meet his criteria. ... Which leads back to the question of why Berkshire has
    so few imitators. After all, another crucial insight of business economics is
    that profitable strategies that can be replicated are imitated until returns from
    them are driven down to normal levels. Why do the majority of investment managers
    hold many more stocks, roll them over far more often, engage in far more complex
    transactions – and derive less consistent and profitable results?

  zh: 如果他是个天才，那也是简单的天才。要理解他对商业成功本质的欣赏，并不需要特别或原创的洞察力。也不难认识到，像美国运通、可口可乐、IBM、富国银行，以及最近[亨氏](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/292eab28-76c5-11e2-8569-00144feabdc0.html
    "亨氏是巴菲特策略的基石 - FT.com")——伯克希尔最大的持股——符合他的标准... 这引出了一个问题：为什么伯克希尔的模仿者这么少？毕竟，商业经济学的另一个重要洞察是，可以复制的盈利策略会被模仿，直到它们的回报降到正常水平。为什么大多数投资经理持有更多股票，更频繁地轮换，进行更复杂的交易——并且产生的结果不一致且利润较低？
- en: 'The explanation, Kay suggests, is that Buffet''s strategy also demands an awful
    lot of hard work and it''s easier for many investment experts to follow the rather
    different strategy of Felix Guattari, not actually working to achieve superior
    insight, but working to make it seem as if they do, mostly by obscuring their
    actual strategies in a bewildering cloud of complexity. Sometimes, as in the case
    of Bernie Madoff, the obscuring complexity can even take the very simple form
    of essentially no information whatsoever. People who are willing to believe need
    very little help:'

  zh: 凯伊提出，这种解释是，巴菲特的策略也要求付出大量的艰苦努力，而对于许多投资专家来说，遵循菲利克斯·瓜塔里（Felix Guattari）的策略要容易得多，并不是真正努力获得卓越的洞察力，而是努力让自己看起来好像做到了，这主要是通过将他们的实际策略隐藏在令人困惑的复杂性中。有时候，像伯纳德·马多夫（Bernie
    Madoff）的案例，这种隐藏的复杂性甚至可以采取本质上没有任何信息的形式。愿意相信的人不需要太多的帮助：
- en: '... the deeper issue is that complexity is intrinsic to the product many money
    managers sell. How can you justify high fees except by reference to frequent activity,
    unique insights and arcana? But Mr Buffett understands the limitations of his
    knowledge. That appreciation distinguishes people who are very clever from those
    who only think they are.'

- en: One final comment. I think finance is rife with this kind of psychological problem.
    But I do not at all believe that science is somehow immune from these effects.
    I've encountered plenty of works in physics and applied mathematics that couch
    their results in beautiful mathematics, demonstrate formidable skill in building
    a framework of theory, and yet seem utterly useless in actually solving or giving
    insight into any real problem. Science also has a weak spot for style over content.

  zh: 最后一点评论。我认为金融界充满了这种心理问题。但我一点也不认为科学 somehow 免疫于这些影响。我在物理学和应用数学领域遇到了很多作品，它们用美丽的数学表述结果，擅长构建理论框架，但在解决或给出任何实际问题的见解上似乎完全无用。科学在形式上也容易忽视内容。
