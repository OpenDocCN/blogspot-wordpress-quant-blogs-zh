    the linking together of institutions by contracts implies a greater chance for
    the propagation of financial stress from one place to another. The same thing
    applies to any network such as the electrical grid -- sharing demands among many
    generating stations makes for a more adaptive and efficient system, able to handle
    fluctuations in demand, yet also means that failures can spread across much of

    if the credit network of the interbank market is a credit chain – in which each
    agent is linked only to one neighbor along a ring – the probability of a collapse
    of each and every agent (a bankruptcy avalanche) in case a node is hit by a shock
    is equal to one. As the number of partners of each agent increases, i.e. as the
    network evolves toward completeness, the risk of a collapse of the agent hit by
    the shock goes asymptotically to zero, thanks to risk sharing. The larger the
    pool of connected neighbors whom the agent can share the shock with, the smaller
    the risk of a collapse of the agent and therefore of the network, i.e. the higher
    network resilience. Systemic risk is at a minimum when the credit network is complete,
    i.e. when agents fully diversify individual risks. In other words, there is a
    monotonically decreasing relationship between the probability of individual failure/systemic
    risk and the degree of connectivity of the credit network.'

  zh: 在他们的开创性贡献中，艾伦和盖尔得出结论，如果银行间市场的信贷网络是一个信贷链——其中每个代理只与环形的一个邻居相连——那么在节点受到冲击的情况下，每个代理（破产雪崩）崩溃的概率等于一。随着每个代理的合作伙伴数量增加，即网络向完整性发展，受到冲击的代理崩溃的风险趋于零，感谢风险共享。代理可以与多少相连的邻居共享冲击，冲击的风险就越小，因此网络的弹性越高。当信贷网络完整时，系统风险最小，即当代理完全多样化个体风险时。换句话说，个体失败/系统性风险的概率与信贷网络的连通度之间存在单调递减的关系。

    risk, arising from factors specific to one bank''s business and which can make

    DOES decrease with increasing connectivity: banks become more resistant to shocks
    coming from their own business, but that systemic risk DOES NOT decrease. The
    latter risk increases with higher connectivity, and can win out in determining
    the overall chance a bank might go bankrupt. In effect, the effort on the part
    of many banks to manage their own risks can end up creating a new systemic risk
    that is worse than the risk they have reduced through risk sharing.'

- en: There are two principle elements in the credit network model they study. First
    is the obvious fact that resilience of an institution in such a network depends
    on the resilience of those with whom it shares risks. Buying CDS against the potential
    default of your Greek bonds is all well and good as long as the bank from whom
    you purchased the CDS remains solvent. In the 2008 crisis, Goldman Sachs and other
    banks had purchased CDS from A.I.G. to cover their exposure to securitized mortgages,
    but those CDS would have been more or less without value had the US government
    not stepped in to bail out A.I.G.

  zh: 第二个因素模型非常重要，这是我 在Bloomberg文章中没有提及的内容。这是指财务困境往往具有固有的非线性特征——一些麻烦或困境往往会引发更多的问题。Battiston及其同事将这称为“趋势加强”，并如下描述：
- en: '... trend reinforcement is also quite a general mechanism in credit networks.
    It can occur in at least two situations. In the first one (see e.g. in (Morris
    and Shin, 2008)), consider an agent A that is hit by a shock due a loss in value
    of some securities among her assets. If such shock is large enough, so that some
    of A’s creditors claim their funds back, A is forced to fire-sell some of the
    securities in order to pay the debt. If the securities are sold below the market
    price, the asset side of the balance sheet is decreasing more than the liability
    side and the leverage of A is unintentionally increased. This situation can lead
    to a spiral of losses and decreasing robustness (Brunnermeier, 2008; Brunnermeier
    and Pederson, 2009). A second situation is the one in which when the agent A is
    hit by a shock, her creditor B makes condition to credit harder in the next period.
    Indeed it is well documented that lenders ask a higher external finance premium
    when the borrowers’ financial conditions worsen (Bernanke et al., 1999). This
    can be seen as a cost from the point of view of A and thus as an additional shock
    hitting A in the next period. In both situations, a decrease in robustness at
    period t increases the chance of a decrease in robustness at period t + 1.'

  zh: …趋势加强也是信用网络中相当普遍的机制。它至少可以在两种情况下发生。在第一种情况（例如，参见Morris和Shin，2008年的研究），考虑一个由于其资产中某些证券价值的损失而受到冲击的代理商A。如果这种冲击足够大，以至于A的一些债权人要求偿还资金，A被迫以低于市场价格的价格出售一些证券以偿还债务。如果证券的出售价格低于市场价格，资产负债表的资产一侧的减少将超过负债一侧，从而无意中增加了A的杠杆。这种情况可能导致损失和稳健性的降低（Brunnermeier，2008；Brunnermeier和Pederson，2009）。第二种情况是当代理商A受到冲击时，其债权人B在下一个时期使信贷条件变得更加严格。实际上，当借款人的财务状况恶化时，贷款人要求更高的外部融资溢价是众所周知的（Bernanke等人，1999年）。从A的角度看，这可以被视为一种成本，因此可以被视为在下一个时期对A的额外冲击。在两种情况下，时期t的稳健性的降低增加了时期t+1的稳健性降低的可能性。

    develop some stochastic equations to follow the evolution of a bank's "robustness"
    R -- considered to be a number between 0 and 1, with 1 being fully robust. A bankruptcy
    event is marked by R passing through 0\. This is a standard approach in the finance
    literature on modeling corporate bankruptcies. The equations they derive incorporate
    their assumptions about the positive influences of risk sharing and the negative
    influences of distress propagation and trend reinforcement.

  zh: 我不会深入到详细的数学计算中。大概来说，作者们建立了一些随机方程来跟踪银行“稳健性”R的变化——被认为是一个介于0和1之间的数字，其中1表示完全稳健。破产事件由R穿过0点来标记。这是公司破产模型化中的一个标准方法。他们推导出的方程包含了关于风险共享的正面影响和困境传播以及趋势加强的负面影响假设。
- en: The key result shows up clearly in the figure (below), which shows the overall
    probability of a bank in the network to go bankrupt (a probability per unit of
    time) versus the amount of risk-sharing connectivity in the network (here given
    by k, the number of partners with which each bank shares risks). It may not be
    easy to see, but the figure shows a dashed line (labeled 'baseline') which reflects
    the classical result on risk sharing in the absence of trend reinforcement. More
    connectivity is always good. But the red curve shows the more realistic result
    with trend reinforcement or the positive feedback associated with financial distress
    taken into account. Now adding connectivity is only good for a while, and eventually
    becomes positively harmful. There's a middle range of optimal connectivity beyond
    which more connections only serve to put bank in greater danger.

    interlinkage of credit networks – one of the main features of globalization –
    allows for international risk sharing but it also makes room for the propagation
