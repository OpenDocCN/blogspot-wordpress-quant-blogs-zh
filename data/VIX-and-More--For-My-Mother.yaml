- en: Over the years I have learned many things from her and I have a wealth of memories
    to cherish, but her absence will leave a large void in my life.  Needless to say,
    I love her and will miss her dearly.

  zh: 多年来，我从她那里学到了许多东西，留下了许多珍贵的回忆，但她的离去给我的生活留下了巨大的空白。不用说，我爱她，会非常怀念她。
- en: When she was just out of college, my mother took a job teaching high school
    math in an inner city school in <place st="on"><city st="on">Hartford</city>,
    <state st="on">Connecticut</state></place>.  She particularly enjoyed teaching
    those who struggled most with math and delighted in making math fun for them by
    translating difficult concepts into games and real life applications.

  zh: 当她刚从大学毕业时，我母亲在康涅狄格州哈特福德市的一所城市高中找到了一份教数学的高中老师工作。她特别喜欢教那些数学最困难的学生，并乐于通过将难以理解的概念转化为游戏和实际生活应用，让他们觉得数学有趣。
- en: I could not have been more than eight years old when she presented me with a
    slide rule and helped me to understand that numbers were more than just tables
    to be memorized, but concepts and relationships that reduced much of the complexity
    of the world to simple truths.  I didn’t know what a Monte Carlo simulation was
    back then, but after she taught me how to calculate batting averages and ERAs,
    I grabbed some dice and lots of paper and created dice baseball leagues, internalizing
    probabilities and distributions along the way so that it became effortless for
    me to create mock baseball leagues, teams, games and players whose various stats
    were just as real in statistical terms as those logged in Fenway Park and Yankee
    Stadium.  Needless to say, when the rest of my class finally got around to long
    division a couple of years later, I just smiled and nodded my head.

  zh: 我可能不超过八岁，她就送我一把尺规，帮我理解数字不仅仅是需要记忆的表格，而是概念和关系，这些能将世界的许多复杂性简化为简单的真理。当时我还不知道蒙特卡洛模拟是什么，但她教会我如何计算打击率和ERA后，我就拿了一把骰子和很多纸，创造了骰子棒球联赛，在这个过程中内化了概率和分布，所以对我来说创建模拟棒球联赛、球队、比赛和球员的统计数据变得轻而易举，这些统计数据在统计意义上与芬威公园和洋基体育场记录的统计数据一样真实。不用说，当我的其他同学几年后终于开始学习除法时，我只是微笑点头。
- en: Though she remained a teacher of one sort or another all her life, my mother
    always wanted to be a journalist more than anything else.  When her career veered
    in a journalistic direction, I was there to cheer her on and learn everything
    I could about the process of gathering information, analyzing it, formulating
    ideas, and presenting them in a persuasive manner.

  zh: 虽然她一生中一直是某种形式的老师，但我母亲总是比任何事情都更想成为一名记者。当她的事业朝着新闻方向发展时，我在旁边为她加油，学习关于信息收集、分析、构思和以说服性方式呈现的一切我能学到的东西。
- en: Only in the last day or two have I come to realize that not only do I find myself
    pursuing some of the same disciplines that were close to her heart, but in many
    ways the expression of my ideas here in this blog are the offspring of her life’s
    work as well.

  zh: 直到最近一两天，我才意识到我不仅发现自己追求一些她生前热爱的学科，而且我在博客中表达的想法也是她一生工作的延续。
- en: The passing of the baton from one generation to the next does not always go
    as smoothly as some might have hoped.  In this case, I could not have been better
    prepared.  Thank you, Mom, for being a great teacher and for everything you have
    done for me.

    a postcard.  Mom, this one is for you.
