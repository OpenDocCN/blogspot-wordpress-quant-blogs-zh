- en: There are two types of bad trades.  The first is the mode-mean trade where the
    mode is positive the mean zero or negative.  One shouldn't make this kind of investment,
    because at best it simply adds noise to one's portfolio.  The net return to the
    passive investor can be especially negative because often they mistakenly overpay
    for management, not anticipating the drawdown, and the agent does not payback
    old profits when this is all revealed. Such trades are common in financial markets,
    and savvy investors are very aware of them.  Junk bonds, writing out-of-the-money
    options, hurricane insurance, are good examples.

  zh: 有两种类型的糟糕交易。第一种是模式平均交易，其中模式为正，平均为零或负。不应进行这种投资，因为最多只会给投资组合增加噪音。被动投资者的净回报可能尤其为负，因为他们经常错误地支付了管理费，没有预料到回撤，并且当一切揭示时，代理商并不偿还旧利润。这种交易在金融市场上很常见，精明的投资者对此非常清楚。垃圾债券、写出价外期权、飓风保险，都是很好的例子。
- en: Another type of bad trade is where losses are expected initially, but supposedly
    it's just a learning curve or scale issue, and eventually once all the ducks are
    in a row the positive cash flow supposedly appears.  These are more common, as
    with any high frequency trading strategy that burns transaction costs, not realizing
    that those close-to-close returns used in the back tests weren't realistic estimates
    of feasible net fill prices.

  zh: 另一种糟糕交易是最初预期会有损失，但据说只是一个学习曲线或规模问题，最终一切就位后，正现金流据说会出现。这种情况更为常见，就像任何会产生交易成本的高频交易策略一样，没有意识到在回测中使用的收盘到收盘回报并不是可行净成交价格的现实估计。
- en: The more money an investor has tied up in such trades the lower their total
    return over the long run. You can try to avoid them, but a better priority is
    to simply identify them and flush them when they reveal themselves. That is, getting
    out of bad investments is probably the single most important thing an investor
    can do,as opposed to finding alpha, which is simply much harder.

  zh: 投资者在此类交易中捆绑的资金越多，长期来看，他们的总回报就越低。你可以尝试避免它们，但更好的优先事项是简单地识别它们，并在它们显露时将其清除。也就是说，摆脱糟糕的投资可能是投资者能做的最重要的事情，而不是寻找阿尔法，这只是更难的事情。
- en: Our economy has many such bad trades going on at any one time, and the sooner
    these are abandoned, the quicker people will reallocate their time towards something
    that actually costs less than its revenue.  Consider guarantees to farmers, which
    supposedly allow farmers to withstand the vagaries of weather, ensuring our very
    survival.  We have policies that encourage producer cartels, direct payments via
    subsidies, paying farmers to not farm, disaster aid, insurance subsidies, and
    export subsidies *and* import tariffs. So now farmers who suffered from the recent
    drought directly get fully insured payments, and those who avoided it get the
    revenue from higher prices.  This isn't helping us become more efficient farmers.

  zh: 我们的经济在任何时候都有许多这样的糟糕交易正在进行，而这些交易被放弃得越早，人们就越快将他们的时间重新分配到实际成本低于其收入的事物上。考虑对农民的保证，据说这些保证可以使农民经受住天气的变幻莫测，确保我们的生存。我们有鼓励生产者卡特尔的政策，通过补贴直接支付，支付农民不耕种，灾难援助，保险补贴以及出口补贴*和*进口关税。所以现在，直接遭受最近干旱影响的农民可以获得完全保险的支付，而那些避免受到影响的农民则因价格上涨而获得收入。这并没有帮助我们成为更高效的农民。
- en: Then we have clean energy, education, defense, high-speed rail, all costly investments that
    potentially will pay off big eventually, but in practice are subverted by special
    interests into a focus on producers not consumers.  If the negative present value
    were revealed via the negative cash flow at market prices, an efficient response
    would be to reallocate capital and labor. Instead, these activities are propped
    up under the hope that mere time will allow some sort of critical take-off point
    in future productivity.

  zh: 然后我们有清洁能源、教育、国防、高速铁路，所有这些都是成本高昂的投资，可能最终会有很大的回报，但实际上被特殊利益扭曲成关注生产者而不是消费者。如果通过市场价格的负现金流来揭示负现值，那么有效的反应将是重新分配资金和劳动力。相反，这些活动在希望仅仅通过时间将来某种关键的生产力起飞点而被支撑着。
- en: Many like to deride the short-term nature of markets, but the long-term rationalizations
    of top-down industrial planning is much worse.  It's not like our non-market economy
    is allocating capital like Berkshire Hathaway, rather just a series of patches
    to problems created by prior programs.

  zh: 许多人喜欢嘲笑市场的短期特性，但自上而下的长期规划的理性化要糟糕得多。不像我们的非市场经济像伯克希尔哈撒韦那样配置资本，只是前期项目造成的问题的一系列补丁。
- en: The best way to increase productivity is to stop doing things that have negative
    NPVs because these have massive opportunity costs, and this is best reflected
    by the true discounted cashflow *sans* government in its myriad forms. Obviously
    this is a pipe dream, but it's an example of the way government can help the economy
    and reduce spending simultaneously.

  zh: 提高生产力的最佳途径是停止做那些具有负净现值的事情，因为这些事情具有巨大的机会成本，而真正的折现现金流*减去*政府及其各种形式很好地反映了这一点。显然这只是一个痴人说梦，但它是政府帮助经济并同时减少支出的一个例子。
- en: There would be some costly adjustments, but as they say, when you are in a hole,
    stop digging. What is prudence in the conduct of every portfolio can scarce be
    folly in that of a great kingdom.

  zh: 在进行一些昂贵的调整时，正如人们所说的，当你陷入困境时，应停止挖掘。在每个投资组合的管理中谨慎行事，对于一个伟大的王国来说几乎不可能是愚蠢的。
