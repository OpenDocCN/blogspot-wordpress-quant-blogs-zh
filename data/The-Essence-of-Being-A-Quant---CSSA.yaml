    matters. In my case, one question that stood out was to define the essence and
    importance of the profession to investment management. I began to realize that
    the term itself or even the profession is poorly defined and articulated even
    within the industry. The first time I was asked what a “quant” was, I simply explained
    that they were number-crunchers that created systems for trading money. The reality
    is not far off from this simplistic explanation. But having read and heard a lot
    of different explanations (and accusations!), the essence of being a quant is
    to translate any possible unit of useable information for either financial forecasting,
    algorithm development, or rules-based systems for trading-  lets call this broad
    class simply “**trading models**“. This includes (but is definitely not limited
    to): 1) fundamental data 2) technical data 3) economic data 4) news 5) weather
    6) or anything that might be considered useful or predictive. The analytical tools
    of the trade have become highly cross-disciplinary and come from a wide variety
    of fields such as (but not limited to): 1)math 2) statistics 3) physics 4) economics
    5) linguistics 6) psychology 7)biology. A lot of the common methods used across
    fields fall in the now burgeoning interdisciplinary field of “data mining and
    analysis.”'

  zh: '- 在假期期间，人们有机会反思一些更哲学性的问题。在我这种情况，其中一个突出的问题就是要定义投资管理职业的本质和重要性。我开始意识到，这个术语本身甚至在这个行业内部都没有很好地定义和阐述。第一次有人问我“量化分析师”是什么时，我只是简单解释说他们是用来创建交易系统的数字处理者。现实情况并不比这个简单的解释复杂多少。但阅读和听到了很多不同的解释（以及指责!),
    量化分析师的本质是将任何可能的可用信息单位翻译成用于金融预测、算法开发或基于规则的交易系统——我们称这个广泛的类别为“**交易模型**”。这包括（但绝不限于）以下内容:
    1) 基本面数据 2) 技术面数据 3) 经济数据 4) 消息 5) 天气 6) 或者可能被认为是具有预测价值的其他任何信息。交易的分析工具已经高度跨学科，并且来自诸如（但不仅限于）以下领域的广泛多样：1)
    数学 2) 统计学 3) 物理学 4) 经济学 5) 语言学 6) 心理学 7) 生物学。许多跨领域常用的方法都属于目前迅速发展的跨学科领域“数据挖掘与分析”。'
- en: 'A quant is simply interested in creating a quantifiable method for developing
    trading models. If a concept is not quantifiable it is often because it is either
    1) not clearly defined or 2) simply not testable. These principles are generally
    respected by all scientists regardless of discipline. There is truthfully no area
    that should not be of interest to a quant, there are just areas that are more
    or less fruitful or simply worth prioritizing. Since financial price data of many
    time series are of high quality and readily available with long histories, this
    is a natural area of priority. Why then do quants seem to frown or pick on technical
    analysis which makes use of the same data? The answer is because most of the original
    technical analysis literature and media falls into the two categories identified
    as being difficult to quantify. Often the concepts and ideas are highly elaborate
    with a wide range of extenuating circumstances where the same conclusion would
    hold a different meaning. This implies a highly complex decision tree approach
    (assuming all of the nuances can be identified or articulated). The downside to
    believing in traditional technical analysis is twofold: 1) a lack of statistical
    robustness 2)  the flawed assumption that markets are stationary- we can rely
    on gravity *but we cannot rely on any measurable financial phenomena to always
    follow the same set of laws or rules since they operate in a dynamic ecosystem
    of different market players; asset managers, central banks, and governments constantly
    try to influence or anticipate the actions of eachother*. While that may sound
    harsh— it does not mean that we should abandon using technical indicators or ideas.
    It simply means that indicators or ideas represent testable inputs into a trading
    model that can and should be monitored or modified as conditions change.'

  zh: 量化交易员仅仅关注为交易模型创建一个可量化的方法。如果一个概念不可量化，那通常是因为它要么是1)定义不清晰，要么是2)根本无法测试。这些原则通常被所有学科的科学家所尊重。实际上，没有任何领域对量化交易员来说应该不感兴趣，只是有些领域更加多产或者值得优先考虑。由于许多时间序列的金融价格数据质量高、历史悠久且容易获得，这是优先考虑的自然领域。那么为什么量化交易员似乎对技术分析皱眉头或者对其嗤之以鼻，而技术分析正是利用了同样的数据呢？答案是，大部分原始的技术分析文献和媒体都属于难以量化的两类。通常，这些概念和想法非常复杂，有许多缓解情况，其中相同的结论会有不同的含义。这暗示了一个高度复杂的决策树方法（假设所有细微差别都能被识别或阐述）。相信传统的技术分析的缺点有两点：1)
    缺乏统计稳健性 2) 假设市场是稳定的——我们可以依赖重力*但不能依赖任何可测量的金融现象，因为它们在一个由不同市场参与者构成的动态生态系统中运作；资产管理经理、中央银行和政府不断试图影响或预测彼此的行为*.虽然这听起来可能很严厉——但这并不意味着我们应该放弃使用技术指标或想法。这仅仅意味着指标或想法是交易模型的可测试输入，这些输入可以根据条件的变化进行监控或修改。
- en: What about the die-hard fundamental analysis approach? They are more similar
    to traditional quants (thanks to value investors for example that often create
    quantitative rules of thumb that are easy to test) and tend to use statistical
    analysis or some form of quantitative application in portfolio management regardless
    of their level of discretionary judgment.  However, they are also guilty of some
    of the same flaws as technical analysts because they often rely on concepts that
    are  either not observable  or not testable from a practical standpoint (and hence
    not quantifiable). For example, if a portfolio manager talks about the importance
    of having a meeting with management and assessing their true intentions for making
    corporate decisions– this is not really testable for a quant. Neither is the leap
    of foresight that an investor has about whether a product that has never been
    sold will be popular. The downside to believing in a purely fundamentalist approach
    is that the relative value of the insights that they claim are important is very
    difficult to assess or measure. Regardless of how important these individuals
    claim (and rationally product foresight is potentially a real skill) their qualitative
    or intuitive insights are, they must be separated from the style or factor exposure
    that is quantifiable (that is taken on either intentionally or unintentionally)
    to determine some baseline of usefulness. For example if a portfolio manager claims
    to buy large cap value stocks with high quality balance sheets, but uses additional
    “judgment factors” to narrow down their list for the portfolio, their performance
    should be benchmarked against a stock screen or factor model that approximates
    their approach. This gives some insight as to how much positive or negative value
    has been added by their added judgment. In many cases this value tends to be negative–which
    calls into question the utility in paying a portfolio manager such exorbitant
    compensation.

  zh: 那么，那些坚持基本面分析的“铁杆”呢？他们与传统量化分析师更为相似（感谢价值投资者，例如他们经常创造出易于测试的量化规则），并且在投资组合管理中，无论其自主判断水平如何，都倾向于使用统计分析或某种形式的量化应用。然而，他们在某些方面也犯有与技术分析师相同的错误，因为他们经常依赖那些从实际出发不可观测或不可测试的概念（因此也无法量化）。例如，如果一个投资组合经理谈论与管理层会面的重要性，以及评估他们做出公司决策的真实意图——这对量化分析师来说是无法真正测试的。同样，投资者对于一个从未销售过的产品是否会受欢迎的远见也是不可量化的。坚持纯粹的基本面分析方法的缺点是，他们所声称的重要洞察力的相对价值非常难以评估或衡量。无论这些个体声称多么重要（以及理性地看，产品预见性可能是一种真正的技能），他们的定性或直觉性洞察力，它们必须与那些可量化的风格或因子暴露（即有意或无意地承担的）分离，以确定一些有用的基准。例如，如果一个投资组合经理声称购买具有高质量资产负债表的大型价值股票，但使用额外的“判断因素”来缩小他们的投资组合名单，那么他们的表现应该与一种接近他们方法的股票筛选或因子模型进行基准对比。这可以让我们了解他们的额外判断增加了多少积极或消极价值。在许多情况下，这种价值往往是负面的——这引发了这样一个问题：是否值得为支付给投资组合经理如此高昂的薪酬。
- en: 'In truth *the quant is as much a threat to the classic portfolio manager role
    as the machine is to human labor*. A quant can manufacture investment approaches
    that are far cheaper, more disciplined, have greater scale, and are more reliable.
    The more advanced and creative the quant is, the more information can be quantified,
    and the more approaches that can be replicated. A quant’s best friend is therefore
    the computer programmer who performs the very important task of creating the automated
    model. Unlike a machine, once a model is created, it can and should be frequently
    improved and monitored. How this process is done distinguishes the professional
    from the amateur quant. A professional quant will make sensible and robust improvements
    that will improve a model’s prospects for dealing with uncertainty, regardless
    of what the model performance is in the short-term– whether it is good or bad.
     The amateur quant will make cosmetic improvements to backtests of the model by
    primarily tweaking parameters in hindsight, or simply make adjustments based on
    short-term performance that would have caught the latest rally or avoided the
    latest decline. Here are a few other key differences between the pros and the
    amateurs when it comes to quant: The professional starts with a simple and clear
    idea, and then increases complexity gradually to suit the problem within an elegant
    framework. The amateur tries to incorporate everything in an awkward framework
    at the same time. The professional will seek to use logic and theory that is as
    general and durable as possible to guide model development or improvement. The
    amateur strives to create exceptional backtests and will be too data-driven with
    model development and refinement decisions. The professional takes a long time
    to slowly but earnestly improve a model fully aware that it can never be perfect.
    The amateur either wants to complete the model and proceed to trading immediately,
    or in the opposite context they are so afraid of failure that they 1)always find
    something that could go wrong 2) are overly skeptical and easily persuaded by
    peer hyperbole over fact 3)are addicted to finding new avenues to test. Finally–and
    perhaps most importantly towards impacting performance: The  professional will
    not give in easily to outside influences (management, clients etc) to make adjustments
    for ill-advised reasons unless there is a long-term or clear business case for
    doing so (the typical trades that the model takes on are perhaps difficult to
    execute in practice). The amateur will buckle to any pressure or negative feedback
    and try to please everyone.'

  zh: 实际上，*量化分析师对经典投资组合经理角色的威胁，与机器对人类劳动力的威胁一样大*。量化分析师可以制造出更加便宜、更有纪律性、规模更大且更可靠的投資方法。量化分析师越先进、越有创造力，就能越多地量化信息，并且可以复制更多的方法。因此，量化分析师最好的朋友就是那些编写程序的计算机程序员，他们执行着创建自动化模型的重要任务。与机器不同，一旦模型被创建，它就应该并且可以经常进行改进和监控。这个过程如何进行，是区分专业量化分析师和业余量化分析师的标准。专业的量化分析师会做出合理和健壮的改进，这些改进将提高模型应对不确定性的前景，无论短期内模型的表现如何——无论是好是坏。而业余量化分析师会通过回顾性地调整参数来美化模型的回测，或者仅仅根据短期表现进行调整，以抓住最新的上涨行情或避免最新的下跌。在量化方面，专业和业余之间还有其他几个关键的区别：专业人员从简单清晰的想法开始，然后逐渐增加复杂性，以适应优雅框架内的問題。业余人员试图在一个尴尬的框架中同时包含所有内容。专业人员会寻求尽可能通用和持久的逻辑和理论来指导模型开发或改进。业余人员努力创造出色的回测，并且在模型开发和精炼决策上过于数据驱动。专业人员会花很长时间逐步但认真地改进模型，深知它永远不可能完美。而业余人员要么想立即完成模型开始交易，或者在相反的情况下，他们过于害怕失败，以至于1)总是找到可能出错的事情
    2)过于怀疑，容易被同行的夸张言辞所说服而不是事实 3)沉迷于寻找新的测试途径。最后，也许最重要的是，对于性能的影响：专业人员不会轻易屈服于外部影响（管理层、客户等），除非有长期或明确的商业案例支持这样做（模型通常采取的交易在实践中可能难以执行）。而业余人员会对任何压力或负面反馈屈服，并试图取悦所有人。
- en: 'If the last paragraph sounds arrogant, I would be happy to admit being guilty
    of one or more of such amateur mistakes earlier in my own career. But this is
    much like the path of development for any field of expertise. In truth, almost
    any “professional” quant learns these lessons whether through peer instruction
    or the “school of hard knocks”. But one of the positive benefits of experience
    and honest self-assessment is that you can learn how to lean in the right direction.
    Without being honest with yourself, one can never get better. To end on a sympathetically
    qualitative note, it is useful to think of a professional quant as also sharing
    the qualities of a martial artist: a quant must also have solid control of their
    own mind and emotions as they relate to working with trading models to be able
    to rise to the highest level. When practiced well, this is not a frenetic and
    purposeful state, but rather what appears to be a focused but almost detached
    state where the decisions are more important than the outcomes. One really good
    idea in a relaxed moment is superior to a hundred hours of determined exploration.
    The benefit to such a state tends to be good and consistent outcomes with regards
    to model performance. Ironically, too much focus and energy invested in the outcome
    (performance) has the opposite effect. The psychology and emotional maturity of
    a quant can be as or more important as their inherent talent or knowledge towards
    driving investment performance. Of course this hypothesis is subject (and should
    be) to quantitative examination.'

  zh: 如果上一段听起来有些自大，我愿意愉快地承认在我的职业生涯早期，我犯过其中一种或多种业余错误。但这很像任何专业知识领域的发展路径。事实上，几乎任何“专业”量化分析师都会通过同行指导或“艰苦的学校”学到这些教训。但经验和真诚自我评估的一个积极好处是，你可以学会如何朝着正确的方向前进。如果不诚实面对自己，你永远无法变得更好。以富有同情的定性方式结束，将专业量化分析师也视为拥有武术家品质的人是有用的：量化分析师必须牢牢控制他们自己的思想和情感，这些情感与交易模型的运用有关，才能达到最高水平。当练习得当时，这并不是一种狂乱和有目的的状态，而更像是一种看起来专注但几乎超然的状态，在这种状态下，决策比结果更重要。在轻松的时刻有一个真正的好主意，胜过一百小时的坚定探索。在这种状态下的好处往往是有关于模型性能的良好且一致的结果。讽刺的是，过于关注和投入精力在结果（性能）上会产生相反的效果。量化分析师的心理学和情感成熟度，对他们内在的才能或知识推动投资绩效来说，可能同等重要或更重要。当然，这个假设需要（并且应该）受到定量检验。
