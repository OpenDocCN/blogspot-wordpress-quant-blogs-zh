    pointed questions about why no executives of major financial institutions have
    been convicted of fraud for their actions in the lead up to the financial crisis.
    As he argues, the Commission set up to explore the crisis found plenty of evidence
    of widespread fraud; the Justice Department has simply failed to act. Why?

  zh: 发表在《纽约书评》上，美国地方法院法官杰德·拉科夫提问，为什么在金融危机之前，没有高管因其在金融机构的行动被定罪。正如他所说，成立调查危机的委员会找到了大量的欺诈证据；司法部只是没有采取行动。为什么？
- en: '...the stated opinion of those government entities asked to examine the financial
    crisis overall is not that no fraud was committed. Quite the contrary. For example,
    the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, in its final report, uses variants of
    the word “fraud” no fewer than 157 times in describing what led to the crisis,
    concluding that there was a “systemic breakdown,” not just in accountability,
    but also in ethical behavior.'

    the number of reports of suspected mortgage fraud rising twenty-fold between 1996
    and 2005 and then doubling again in the next four years. As early as 2004, <acronym>FBI</acronym>
    Assistant Director Chris Swecker was publicly warning of the “pervasive problem”
    of mortgage fraud, driven by the voracious demand for mortgage-backed securities.
    Similar warnings, many from within the financial community, were disregarded,
    not because they were viewed as inaccurate, but because, as one high-level banker
    put it, “A decision was made that ‘We’re going to have to hold our nose and start
    buying the stated product if we want to stay in business.’”

    financial crisis, the prevailing view of many government officials (as well as
    others) was that the crisis was in material respects the product of intentional
    fraud. In a nutshell, the fraud, they argued, was a simple one. Subprime mortgages,
    i.e., mortgages of dubious creditworthiness, increasingly provided the chief collateral
    for highly leveraged securities that were marketed as <acronym>AAA</acronym>,
    i.e., securities of very low risk. How could this transformation of a sow’s ear
    into a silk purse be accomplished unless someone dissembled along the way?

  zh: 不用再举更多的例子了，问题的关键是，在金融危机之后，许多政府官员（以及其他人士）的普遍看法是，这场危机在很大程度上是故意欺诈的结果。简而言之，他们认为，这个欺诈很简单。次级抵押贷款，即信誉可疑的抵押贷款，越来越多地成为高度杠杆化证券的主要抵押品，这些证券被标榜为<acronym>AAA</acronym>，即风险非常低。除非有人在过程中隐瞒了什么，否则如何能将一个劣质产品转化为优质产品？

- en: 'Rakoff goes on the examine these grounds, and finds none of them convincing.
    So, then, why no prosecutions? He discounts the revolving door theory -- the prosecutors
    have avoided action because of former links to financial firms, or hope of future
    employment links -- because, in his experience, prosecutors are well motivated
    to get convictions. He suggests that there are a host of reasons: prosecutors
    simply had other priorities in the years after 9/11/2001; in many cases government
    regulators acquiesced early on to changing practices, where in increasingly lax
    demands on mortgage documentation became the norm. And, finally and most importantly,
    he points to changes in prosecuting practices over the past few decades:'

  zh: 拉科夫继续审视这些理由，并发现它们都不令人信服。那么，为什么没有起诉呢？他排除了旋转门理论——检察官因为曾与金融机构有联系或希望未来有就业关系而避免采取行动——因为在他的经验中，检察官很有动力去获得有罪判决。他提出有一系列原因：检察官在2001年9月11日之后
    simply had other priorities；在许多案例中，政府监管机构一开始就默许了改变的做法，其中越来越宽松的按揭文件要求成为常态。最后，最重要的是，他指出了过去几十年起诉实践的变化：
- en: The final factor I would mention is both the most subtle and the most systemic
    of the three, and arguably the most important. It is the shift that has occurred,
    over the past thirty years or more, from focusing on prosecuting high-level individuals
    to focusing on prosecuting companies and other institutions. It is true that prosecutors
    have brought criminal charges against companies for well over a hundred years,
    but until relatively recently, such prosecutions were the exception, and prosecutions
    of companies without simultaneous prosecutions of their managerial agents were
    even rarer.

    do. And while a company might get the benefit of some such crimes, prosecuting
    the company would inevitably punish, directly or indirectly, the many employees
    and shareholders who were totally innocent. Moreover, under the law of most US
    jurisdictions, a company cannot be criminally liable unless at least one managerial
    agent has committed the crime in question; so why not prosecute the agent who
    actually committed the crime?

    prosecuting companies, often even without indicting a single person. This shift
    has often been rationalized as part of an attempt to transform “corporate cultures,”
    so as to prevent future such crimes; and as a result, government policy has taken
    the form of “deferred prosecution agreements” or even “nonprosecution agreements,”
    in which the company, under threat of criminal prosecution, agrees to take various
    prophylactic measures to prevent future wrongdoing. Such agreements have become,
    in the words of Lanny Breuer, the former head of the Department of Justice’s Criminal
    Division, “a mainstay of white-collar criminal law enforcement,” with the department
    entering into 233 such agreements over the last decade. But in practice, I suggest,
    this approach has led to some lax and dubious behavior on the part of prosecutors,
    with deleterious results.

  zh: 然而，在最近几十年里，检察官越来越倾向于起诉公司，甚至在没有起诉任何个人的情况下。这种转变常常被认为是对“企业文化”进行改革的一部分，以防止未来发生此类犯罪；因此，政府政策采取了“暂缓起诉协议”甚至“不起诉协议”的形式，在刑事起诉的威胁下，公司同意采取各种预防措施，以防止未来发生违法行为。这种协议，正如前美国司法部刑事
    division 负责人 Lanny Breuer 所言，已成为“白领刑事司法的基石”，该部门在过去十年中签订了 233 项此类协议。但在实际操作中，我建议，这种方法导致了一些检察官的宽松和可疑行为，产生了不利后果。

    has hired a former assistant US attorney, now a partner at a respected law firm,
    to do an internal investigation. The company’s counsel asks you to defer your

    value of successfully prosecuting individuals far outweighs the prophylactic benefits
    of imposing internal compliance measures that are often little more than window-dressing.
    Just going after the company is also both technically and morally suspect. It
    is technically suspect because, under the law, you should not indict or threaten
    to indict a company unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that some managerial
    agent of the company committed the alleged crime; and if you can prove that, why
    not indict the manager? And from a moral standpoint, punishing a company and its
    many innocent employees and shareholders for the crimes committed by some unprosecuted
    individuals seems contrary to elementary notions of moral responsibility.
