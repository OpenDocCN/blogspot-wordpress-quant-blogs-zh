  zh: 我常听到这样的论点：像爱德华·肯尼迪（周三去世，约翰·F·肯尼迪的兄弟）这样生于富贵与特权之中的人，因致力于为穷人服务、成为“公仆”（见下文Blogging
    Heads）而应受到赞扬。但理想中的公仆，从统计学角度讲，不会整天试图对我发号施令。

- en: I often hear the argument that people like Edward Kennedy (who died Wednesday,
    brother of John F Kennedy), born to wealth and privilege, are to be praised for
    working for the poor, becoming 'public servants' (see Blogging Heads below). My
    ideal servant would not spend all his time trying to boss me around, statistically
    speaking.

    chose a life of power. That choice satisfied an appetite that is far grosser,
