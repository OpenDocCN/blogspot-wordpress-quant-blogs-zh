    one of my favorite trading books to browse through is the Stock Trader’s Almanac,
    complied by [Jeffrey Hirsch and Yale Hirsch](http://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/sta/home.do).  The
    current version of this annual classic, [Stock Trader’s Almanac 2008](http://www.amazon.com/Stock-Traders-Almanac-2008-Investor/dp/0470109858/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199805182&sr=8-1),
    has already been sitting on my desk for three months.'

  zh: '![](img/19c0eb7514ffc60dde6159cbac3f80e6.png)我首先要承认，我最喜欢浏览的交易书籍之一是《股票交易者年鉴》，该书由[杰弗里·
    Hirsch和耶鲁· Hirsch](http://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/sta/home.do)编辑。这本年度经典current
    version, [《股票交易者年鉴2008》](http://www.amazon.com/Stock-Traders-Almanac-2008-Investor/dp/0470109858/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199805182&sr=8-1)，已经摆在了我桌上三个月了。'
- en: I mention this book because the authors have been instrumental in widely disseminating
    the idea of the ‘[January Baromenter](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/januarybarometer.asp),’
    which posits that “as goes January, so goes the market.”  While the idea of the
    January Barometer dates back to at least 1972, the corollary, which should be
    on the mind of many investors today, is that the first five days of January provide
    an effective ‘early warning system’ about the trend for the balance of the year.

  zh: 我提起这本书，是因为作者们在广泛传播“[一月晴雨表](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/januarybarometer.asp)”这一观念方面起了重要作用，该观念认为“一月如何，市场便如何”。虽然“一月晴雨表”这一观念至少可以追溯到1972年，但其推论，今天许多投资者都应该放在心上，即一月的头五天为整年趋势提供了一个有效的“早期预警系统”。
- en: Before I critique these two ideas, let me point out that the data for the general
    premise of January as a microcosm of a full trading year is compelling.  Using
    the S&P 500 index, the January Barometer includes only five major errors in the
    past 58 years; and 31 of the last 36 times the first five days were up, the year
    ended up as well.

  zh: 在我批评这两个观点之前，让我指出，关于一月是全年交易缩影的一般前提数据是有说服力的。使用标普500指数，一月晴雨表在过去58年中只出现了五个主要错误；而过去36次第一天开盘上涨，全年表现也上涨了。
- en: But before you load up on more [QID](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=qid)
    in anticipation of the market being sucked into a black hole, it is important
    to recognize that the data obscures what happens when the year gets off to a particularly
    ugly start, as it has in the first four trading days of year (through yesterday),
    where the SPX has been down 3.6%.

  zh: 但在你预期市场会被吸入黑洞而大量买入[QID](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=qid)之前，重要的是要认识到数据掩盖了年初开盘
    particularly ugly的情况，就像今年前四交易日（截至昨天），标普500指数下跌了3.6%。
- en: 'As it turns out, since 1950 the SPX has only had a five day start that was
    worse than 2008 on two occasions: 1978 and 1991.  In both cases, however, the
    year managed to turn around and finish in the green.  In 1978, the SPX shook off
    a -4.7% first five days and was up 6.0% the rest of the year.  The turnaround
    in 1991 was even more dramatic, as anyone who owned NASDAQ stocks (up 56.8% that
    year) will surely recall.  After falling 4.6% the first five days of 1991, the
    SPX was up 32.5% for the remainder of the year.'

  zh: 结果证明，自1950年以来，标普500指数只有两次开盘五天的表现比2008年更差：1978年和1991年。然而，在这两种情况下，全年都实现了逆转并最终收涨。1978年，标普500指数在前五天下跌了4.7%，但其余年份表现上涨了6.0%。1991年的逆转更加戏剧化，任何当年持有纳斯达克股票的人（那年上涨了56.8%）一定会印象深刻。1991年前五天下跌了4.6%，但标普500指数在当年剩余时间上涨了32.5%。
- en: If one wants to expand the analysis to the worst full month starts since 1950,
    the four worst of these starts also turned around by the end of the year as well.  In
    1970, January was down 7.6%, but the balance of the year was up 8.4%.  In 1960,
    it was -7.1% followed by +4.5%; in 1990 it was -6.9% and +0.3%; and in 1978 it
    was -6.2%, with a +7.7% turnaround from February through December.

  zh: 如果一个人想要把分析扩展到自1950年以来最糟糕的一个月开盘情况，这四个月份的糟糕开盘也都在年底实现了逆转。1970年，1月份下跌了7.6%，但整年表现上涨了8.4%。1960年，开盘下跌7.1%，随后上涨4.5%；1990年开盘下跌6.9%，随后上涨0.3%；1978年开盘下跌6.2%，从2月到12月实现了7.7%的逆转。
- en: As always, be careful with what you take away from this analysis.  Of the 21
    Januarys that the SPX has been down, the balance of the year was down 10 times
    and up 11 times.  The bottom line?  If there is any message worth remembering
    from the data above, it is that good starts tend to persist, ugly ones tend to
    reverse, and slightly down beginnings run the greatest risk of turning into a
    rout.

  zh: 正如往常一样，在从这次分析中提取信息时要小心。在标普500指数（SPX）在1月下跌的21年中，全年下跌的有10次，上涨的有11次。结论是？如果上述数据中有任何值得记住的信息，那就是好的开始往往能够持续，糟糕的开始往往会有所逆转，而稍微下跌的开局则存在最大的风险演变成崩盘。
