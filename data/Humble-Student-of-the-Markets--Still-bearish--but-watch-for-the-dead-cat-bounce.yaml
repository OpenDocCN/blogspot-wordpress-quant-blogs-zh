    or no news Thursday after an upside surprise on 1Q GDP and a relatively unsurprising
    FOMC meeting. After the dust settled, the SPX was down about 2% on the day, which
    is highly unusual given the recent low volatility environment that the market
    has been experiencing.

- en: What caught my eye was the sheer panic associated with Thursday's sell-off.
    The prices of none of the usual diversifying asset classes such as Treasuries
    (IEF, TLT) and gold held up well on the day. This is suggestive of a rush to cash
    - a seemingly margin clerk's market where market participants are forced to de-risk
    for institutional reasons. But that explanation doesn't really hold water, as
    the SPX is only about 3% from its all-time high at the close Thursday. I honestly
    have no idea why the markets went risk-off it did on Thursday, but the lack of
    an explanation suggests that the markets are due for a dead-cat bounce in the
    near future.

  zh: 引起我注意的是周四抛售所伴随的恐慌程度。通常起到分散风险作用的资产类别，如国债（IEF，TLT）和黄金的价格当天都没有很好地保持稳定。这表明市场参与者出于机构原因被迫去风险，看似margin
    clerk的市场。但这种解释实际上并不成立，因为周四收盘时标普500指数仅比历史高点低约3%。老实说，我完全不知道市场为什么会在周四突然转向风险厌恶，但缺乏解释暗示市场在不久的将来可能会出现死猫跳反弹。

    the sell-off was the spike in fear levels seen in the option market. The VIX/VXV
    ratio, which is a measure of the term structure of volatility, moved from a normal
    upward sloping curve to inversion in a single day. As the chart below shows, the
    majority of past VIX inversion, which are marked by dotted vertical lines, have
    historically been reasonably low-risk entry points on the long side of the market

- en: As well, other signs are showing that the fear levels are getting a little overdone
    in the short-term. The middle panel of the chart blow shows that the VIX Index
    is at or near the top of an upward sloping channel indicating excessive panic.
    In addition, the bottom panel shows the ratio of the small cap Russell 2000 to
    the large cap SPX. Small caps have been very weak in the last few weeks, but the
    RUT/SPX ratio did not make a new low and confirm Thursday's weakness - a supportive
    sign for the dead-cat bounce case.

  zh: 此外，其他迹象也显示，短期内恐慌情绪有些过头。图表中间的面板显示，波动率指数（VIX）位于或接近上升通道的顶部，这表明过度恐慌。此外，底部的面板显示了小盘股
    Russell 2000 与大盘股 SPX 的比率。在过去几周里，小盘股非常弱势，但 RUT/SPX 比率并没有创新低，也没有确认周四的弱势——这是死猫跳反弹的一个支持性信号。
- en: Despite the oversold readings, the technical picture for the SPX is mixed. The
    index sliced through the 50 day moving average, which typically acts as a support
    zone, as if the support level was non-existent. Such episodes of dramatic weakness
    are indications of severe technical breakdown. Short-term, the SPX is sitting
    just above a minor support zone at the 1925-1930 level which could serve to arrest
    any further near-term weakness.

  zh: 尽管出现了超卖的读数，但标普500的技术图表是混合的。指数似乎毫不费力地穿过了50日均线，而这条均线通常作为一个支撑区域。这种剧烈的弱势表现是技术性严重崩溃的迹象。短期内，标普500正位于1925-1930点的次要支撑区域上方，这可能有助于阻止任何进一步的短期弱势。
- en: I have no idea what NFP will show tomorrow morning, but US equities are oversold
    and due for a dead-cat bounce. Intermediate term, however, the crystal ball gets
    a little cloudy. I would like to look at how the market behaves at the obvious
    downside targets at the next two Fibonacci retracement levels of about 1900 and
    1865 and how the fundamental backdrop is developing before making further calls
    on market direction.
