- en: I am writing a prototype of an app that has multiple levels of grouping. I need
    to be able to double-click on the column header of a band, and have it do something
    to only the rows in that band. For instance, if the user double-clicks on the
    column that says 'Selected', then I want every checkbox in that group to be toggled
    without affecting the rows in any other group.

- en: Sounds easy, right? Find out which header you double-clicked on, and then get
    the child rows that are associated with that header. The problem is that headers
    are not considered true rows within UltraWinGrid. They are "UI Elements". They
    do not have references to the rows that are directly beneath them.

  zh: 听起来很简单，不是吗？找出你双击了哪个标题，然后获取与该标题相关联的子行。问题是，在UltraWinGrid中，标题并不是真正的行。它们是“UI元素”。它们没有引用直接下面的行。

- en: Here is what I finally came up with after a few hours of tinkering around. (By
    the way, the function 'ToggleSelected' is a good way of walking down the entire
    tree of rows in a grouped grid.)

  zh: 经过几小时的鼓捣，我最终想出了这个方法。（顺便说一下，函数'ToggleSelected'是在分组网格中遍历整棵树行的一个好方法。）
