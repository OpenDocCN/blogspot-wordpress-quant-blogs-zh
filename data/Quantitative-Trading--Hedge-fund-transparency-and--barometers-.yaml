  zh: '[文章](http://allaboutalpha.com/blog/2011/06/30/hedge-fund-indexes-learn-to-walk-upright-introducing-the-hedge-fund-barometer/)'
- en: about the increasing demand for transparency of hedge fund strategies by institutional
    investors, so much so that they are essentially willing to invest only in managed
    accounts with real-time trades and positions updates. This is, of course, bad
    for fund managers, since not only can the investor reverse-engineer the simpler
    strategies from such knowledge, they can also piggy-back on the trades, thus paying
    a much smaller portion of their profits as performance fee. One might be tempted
    to think that since the investors are going to reverse-engineer the product anyway,
    why not just make it as simple and as generic as possible, and charge a much lower
    fee than the usual 2-20 (which hopefully will attract a much larger investor base),
    so that the main value to the investor is just convenience and not the originality
    of the strategy?

  zh: 关于机构投资者对对冲基金策略透明度需求的增加，以至于他们实际上只愿意投资于实时交易和持仓更新的管理账户。这对基金经理来说当然是不利的，因为投资者不仅可以从这些知识中反向工程出更简单的策略，他们还可以跟单，从而只需支付他们利润的一小部分作为业绩费用。人们可能会有这样的诱惑，认为既然投资者无论如何都会反向工程这个产品，为什么不尽量让它简单和通用，并收取比通常的2-20（希望这能吸引更大的投资者基础）低得多的费用，这样对投资者的主要价值只是方便，而不是策略的原创性？
- en: In fact, Jim wants to do just that. He proposes to construct hedge fund "barometers",
    essentially prototypical hedge fund strategies running in managed accounts. This
    would work well if these barometers have large enough capacities such that the
    performance can hold up even when a large number of investors sign up. From the
    investors' point of view, this is a trade-off between investing in a truly outstanding,
    high-performance strategy while paying a large fee and losing "transparency",
    versus just investing in a generic strategy that may still outperform the broad
    market. For some institutional investors, this might just be the bargain they
    are looking for.

  zh: 实际上，Jim想做的就是这件事。他提议构建对冲基金“晴雨表”，本质上是在管理账户中运行的典型对冲基金策略原型。如果这些晴雨表有足够大的容量，以至于即使有大量投资者注册，业绩也能保持稳定，这将运作得很好。从投资者的角度来看，这是在投资一个真正出色、高性能的策略同时支付高额费用和失去“透明度”，与只是投资一个可能仍然跑赢大盘的通用策略之间的权衡。对于一些机构投资者来说，这可能正是他们寻找的交易。
