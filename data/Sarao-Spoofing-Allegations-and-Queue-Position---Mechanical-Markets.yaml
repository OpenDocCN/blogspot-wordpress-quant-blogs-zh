- en: One of many unanswered questions about the Sarao case is whether he might be
    able to reasonably argue that his alleged ‘spoof’ orders were actually part of
    a market-making strategy. Bradley Hope [uploaded](https://twitter.com/bradleyhope/status/591375301537570817)
    some more documents last night, that I think could help answer that question.

  zh: 关于萨拉奥案许多未回答的问题之一是，他是否能够合理地辩称，他所谓的“欺诈”订单实际上是市场制造策略的一部分。布拉德利·霍普（Bradley Hope）[上传](https://twitter.com/bradleyhope/status/591375301537570817)了一些文件，我认为这些文件可能有助于回答这个问题。
- en: The [FBI complaint](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/04/21/sarao_criminal_complaint.pdf)
    mentions how often Sarao modified his orders, without much detail on the nature
    of those modifications. Modifying an order frequently doesn’t, on its own, suggest
    manipulative activity. There are lots of legitimate reasons why market-makers
    use that exchange instruction to update their quotes. And perhaps Sarao’s defense
    could make an argument that he was actually intending to market-make, only several
    ticks away from the BBO. He certainly would not be the only market-maker posting
    liquidity far away from the current price, a trading strategy that could be one
    of the oldest in existence. If so, it would be consistent with a high modification
    rate and low fill rate. And perhaps he could claim that he tended to post more
    quantity on the sell-side as part of his quoting strategy (remember, he appears
    to have mostly traded during volatile times).

  zh: 美国联邦调查局（FBI）的投诉书（[点击查看](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/04/21/sarao_criminal_complaint.pdf)）提到了萨拉奥如何经常修改他的订单，但没有太多关于这些修改性质的详细信息。频繁修改订单本身并不一定意味着操纵行为。市场制造商使用该交易所指令更新他们的报价有很多合法理由。也许萨拉奥的辩护可以提出他实际上意在市场制造，只是离最佳买卖价（BBO）几个点而已。他肯定不是唯一一个在当前价格远端发布流动性的市场制造商，这种交易策略可能是存在已久的策略之一。如果是这样，那么高修改率和低成交率将保持一致。也许他可以声称他倾向于在卖出侧发布更多数量，这是他报价策略的一部分（记住，他似乎主要在波动时期交易）。
- en: 'So, one detail I would like to know is whether Sarao used those modification
    requests to update legitimate quotes as the market price moved, or whether he
    used them in some other fashion more indicative of manipulation. Last night’s
    documents may contain a hint. From p.53, which contains an email from Sarao to
    Matt Garley of Trading Technologies:'

  zh: 所以，我想知道的一个细节是，萨拉奥是否用这些修改请求来更新合法的报价，随着市场价格的变动，或者他是否用它们以其他更倾向于操纵的方式。昨晚的文件可能包含暗示。从第53页开始，包含萨拉奥致交易技术公司（Trading
    Technologies）的电子邮件：

- en: This could help explain his allegedly high modification rate and, in my view,
    is really bizarre. If I understand it properly (and I might not), he is requesting
    a feature to automatically send 2 modification requests to the exchange whenever
    someone else joins his price level. The first request would be to increment his
    order’s quantity by 1 lot and, right after, a second request would decrement it
    by 1 lot. This would result in no net change in his order’s quantity, but would
    have the effect of moving him to the back of the [FIFO queue](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Matching+Algorithms#MatchingAlgorithms-FIFO).
    An order at the back of the queue only gets filled when the entire price level
    trades, usually indicating a very toxic incoming order.

  zh: 这可以帮助解释他所谓的高修改率，在我看来，这真的很奇怪。如果我理解正确（也许我理解不对），他要求一个自动向交易所发送2个修改请求的功能，每当有人加入他的价格水平时。第一个请求将增加他订单的数量1个单位，紧接着，第二个请求将减少它1个单位。这将导致他的订单数量没有净变化，但将有助于把他移到[FIFO队列](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Matching+Algorithms#MatchingAlgorithms-FIFO)的后面。队列末尾的订单只有在整个价格水平交易时才会被填充，这通常表示一个非常有毒的
    incoming order。
- en: Why would somebody want their order to be at the back of the queue, which almost
    certainly has worse adverse selection characteristics than the front? [One possibility](https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/591400826574344192)
    is that he wanted to be at the back of the queue in order for his strategy to
    have advance notice of the price level being swept-through, because trade confirmations
    sometimes are [sent to those who were executed prior to being distributed on the
    public data feed](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323798104578455032466082920).
    However, it wouldn’t make sense to send large orders for this purpose, nor is
    it consistent with the picture we have of Sarao being a low-speed trader. [Another
    possibility](https://twitter.com/patrickrooney/status/591407223747796993) is that
    he wanted to reduce his fill rate to avoid being filled simultaneously across
    multiple products, but still quote large size. I’m a little skeptical that doing
    so would improve a strategy’s profitability. But I’m not familiar with many markets,
    and maybe on some it makes sense for capital-constrained traders.

  zh: 为什么有人想要他们的订单在队伍的后面，这几乎肯定比前面有更差的逆向选择特征呢？[一种可能性](https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/591400826574344192)是，他想站在队伍后面，让他的策略提前知道被扫过的价格水平，因为交易确认有时会[发送给在公开数据馈送分发之前执行的人](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323798104578455032466082920)。然而，这样做大型订单没有意义，这也不符合我们对Sarao是一个低速交易者的看法。[另一种可能性](https://twitter.com/patrickrooney/status/591407223747796993)是，他想降低他的填充率，以避免在多个产品上同时被填充，但仍报价大量规模。我对这样做是否会提高策略的盈利性有些怀疑。但我对许多市场都不熟悉，也许在某些市场上，对于资本受限的交易者来说这是有意义的。
- en: 'But there is a third possibility: that he wanted to be at the back of the queue
    in order to minimize his chances of trading, without regard for the actual profitability
    of trading. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that these alleged orders
    were intended solely to deceive others. Another hint that could support this hypothesis
    is contained in an email he sent to Joanna Jasina of the FCA (p48 of the same

  zh: 但是还有第三种可能性：他想站在队伍的后面，以最小化自己的交易机会，而不管交易的实际盈利性。这与这些所谓订单旨在完全欺骗他人的假设相一致。支持这一假设的另一个线索包含在他发给FCA的Joanna
    Jasina的一封电子邮件中（同一文件的p48）：
- en: No wonder they [HFTs] can manipulative on top of my orders without any risk,
    for even when I change my mind and decide to sell into my buy order, the manipulative
    orders on top of my initial buy order disappear in the 4 milliseconds it takes

- en: This quote suggests that, when he pulled his orders, those behind him in the
    queue quickly pulled theirs. Hypothetically, if Sarao were indeed spoofing, this
    could indicate that he sometimes hoped to trade with those who copied his ‘spoof’
    order. In order to not trade with himself, he would either have to delete his
    own order before trying to trade with the victims (evidently high-speed traders
    who could quickly delete in response), or he would have to be behind the victim’s
    order in the queue. I’m under the impression that the CME does not take kindly
    to self-trading and this was before the days of [Self-Match Prevention](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/manipulation-using-compliance-tools-equities-analysis-inspired-by-allston-case/),
    so, if Sarao was set on this type of spoofing, he’d have little choice but to
    send his orders to the back of the queue.

  zh: 这句话表明，当他取消了他的订单时，队列中排在后面的人很快也取消了他们的订单。假设萨拉奥确实在虚造订单，这可能意味着他有时希望与那些复制他的“虚造”订单的人交易。为了不与自己交易，他要么必须在尝试与受害者交易之前删除自己的订单（显然是能够迅速响应并删除的高速度交易员），要么他必须排在受害者的订单之后。我对CME对自我交易的态度印象不佳，这还是在[自我匹配预防](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/manipulation-using-compliance-tools-equities-analysis-inspired-by-allston-case/)出现之前，所以，如果萨拉奥坚持这种虚造订单的方式，他只能把他的订单发送到队列的末尾。

    are actually reflective of what he was thinking, but I would like to hear more
