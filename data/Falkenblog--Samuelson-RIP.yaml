- en: Paul Samuelson died last weekend, and its a fitting time to assess his economic
    output. People I knew who knew him never failed to note his great intelligence,
    which was probably off the IQ charts. Given that cleverness is probably the most
    important quality of an economist-respected economist, his prominence is mainly
    a 'he's *SMART*' response everyone has when discussing his work.

  zh: 保罗·塞缪尔森上周去世，现在是评估他的经济成果的适当时机。我认识的一些人每当谈论他的工作时，都会不约而同地提到他的聪明才智，这可能是超出了智商范围。鉴于聪明才智可能是一位受人尊敬经济学家最重要的品质，他的显赫主要是人们谈论他的工作时，普遍会做出‘他很聪明’的反应。
- en: 'Samuelson was an economist''s economist, publishing almost a paper a month
    in his prime. His papers were rigorous, and often invoked obscure theorems as
    if everyone knew them. His Foundations of Economic Analysis laid down the rigorous
    methodology, showing how economics can be fruitfully studied as the solution to
    maximization problems explicitly employing differential and integral calculus:
    equilibrium based on the solution to maximizing agents. Little remembered was
    he also stressed a ''correspondence principle'', so that equilibria needed a certain
    degree of robustness, stability, to be important. This property was later basically
    ignored. He gave us our first understanding of how randomness is consistent with
    ration expectations, overlapping generations model, revealed preference theory,
    and several other major tools in the economic modeling toolkit.'

  zh: 塞缪尔森是经济学家中的精英，他的鼎盛时期几乎每个月都会发表一篇论文。他的论文很严谨，常常引用晦涩的定理，仿佛每个人都知道。他的《经济分析基础》奠定了严格的方法论，展示了经济学如何作为明确使用微分和积分的最大化问题的解来进行富有成果的研究：基于最大化代理人的均衡。很少有人记得他还强调了‘对应原理’，使得均衡需要一定程度的健壮性和稳定性才能重要。这一属性后来基本被忽视了。他给我们带来了有关随机性如何与理性预期一致、重叠代际模型、显性偏好理论以及经济建模工具箱中的其他一些主要工具的第一个理解。
- en: 'But the best way to evaluate Samuelson''s thinking on economics is to look
    at the evolution of his Principles text, which dominated the field for 30 years.
    He built up what was to become orthodox Keynesianism: that Government spending
    was basically the same as Investment (in that old C+I+G), in that both added to
    the capital stock. Via the Multiplier, Government spending magically created 3
    times its spending in output. This implied that expenditures were almost always
    a free lunch. He focused on the Paradox of Thrift, the idea that economies tend
    to save too much, retarding growth, and necessitating government deficit spending
    when below full employment (which is always the case in real time). He believed
    private enterprise is afflicted with periodic acute and chronic cycles in unemployment,
    output and prices, which government had a responsibility to alleviate. "The private
    economy is not unlike a machine without an effective steering wheel or governor,"
    Samuelson wrote. "Compensatory fiscal policy tries to introduce such a governor
    or thermostatic control device" (Principles, 1948)'

  zh: 评价塞缪尔森经济思想的最佳方式是观察他的《原理》文本的演变，这本书在30年间一直是该领域的主导。他打造了后来成为正统凯恩斯主义的基础：政府支出基本上与投资相同（在旧的C
    + I + G中），因为两者都增加了资本存量。通过乘数效应，政府支出神奇般地创造了3倍的产出。这意味着支出几乎总是免费的午餐。他关注节俭的悖论，即经济往往存在过多的储蓄，阻碍增长，并且在低于充分就业时（这在实际情况下总是存在），需要政府赤字支出。他相信私营企业受周期性的急性和慢性失业、产出和价格循环的折磨，政府有责任缓解这种情况。塞缪尔森写道：“私营经济不像一个没有有效方向盘或调节器的机器，”。“补偿性财政政策试图引入这样的调节器或恒温控制装置”（原理，1948）
- en: Samuelson generally thought taxes were innocuous at worst, but often morally
    just, and productive. Several editions displayed a chart showing that poor, underdeveloped
    countries had a tendency to tax less, relative to national product, suggesting
    causation (Principles, 1958). He thought the Laffer-curve was incorrect, and that
    greater progressivity to taxes would not only stimulate the economy directly (because
    the rich consumer less than the poor at the margin), but taxes might actually
    make some people "work harder in order to make their million."

  zh: 萨缪尔森一般认为税收最坏的情况下是无害的，但往往是道义的合理和有益的。几个版本显示了一张图表，表明贫困落后的国家有往往较少征税，相对于国民产品，暗示了因果关系（《原理》，1958）。他认为拉弗曲线是不正确的，并且认为税收更具有进步性不仅会直接刺激经济增长（因为富人在边际成本上的消费比穷人要少），而且税收可能实际上会使一些人“更加努力地工作以获得百万美金”。
- en: He emphasized market failure as endemic to capitalist systems, including imperfect
    competition, externalities, inequities, monopoly power and public goods. Samuelson
    pointed out that the government could take of "an almost infinite variety of roles
    in response to the flaws in the market mechanism" Explanations of market failure
    deserve a counterbalancing discussion of government failures, which are not difficult
    to document, but this was not considered very important to Samuelson, relatively.

  zh: 他强调市场失败是资本主义体系的固有问题，包括不完全竞争，外部性，不公平，垄断权力和公共物品。萨缪尔森指出政府对“市场机制中的缺陷几乎无穷无尽的角色”。市场失败的解释应该与政府的失败进行相互表述，这些并不难证明，但这对萨缪尔森来说并不那么重要。
- en: Just before the fall of communism in the thirteenth edition (1989), Samuelson
    and Nordhaus declared, "the Soviet economy is proof that, contrary to what many
    skeptics had earlier believed, a socialist command economy can function and even
    thrive." Six years later in the fifteenth edition (1995) they noted that Soviet
    Communism was a "failed model". He did not have much to say about the free market
    success stories, from West Germany's post war recovery, or the success of countries
    Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. If it couldn't be
    traced to a government program, it wasn't that interesting.

  zh: 在共产主义倒台之前的第十三版（1989），萨缪尔森和诺德豪斯宣布：“苏联经济证明，与许多怀疑论者先前的看法相反，社会主义计划经济可以运转甚至可以繁荣。”六年后的第十五版（1995），他们注意到苏联共产主义是“失败的模式”。他对于西德的战后复苏，或者韩国，新加坡，台湾，印度尼西亚，马来西亚和泰国等国家的成功并没有多少发言。如果这一切不能追溯到政府计划，那就没那么有趣。
- en: He made market perfection the enemy of the good, ignoring the government failures
    Public housing, international aid, Africa, India, the lowered labor participation
    of African Americans, higher levels of debt, the destructive effects of unions
    on the US steel and auto industries, all irrelevant, relative to various market
    failures. His students include Krugman and Stiglitz, who clearly were influenced
    by Samuelson's natural skepticism of the market.

  zh: 他把市场完美视为善的敌人，忽视了政府的失败公共住房，国际援助，非洲，印度，非裔美国人的劳动参与率降低，更高的债务水平，工会对美国钢铁和汽车工业的破坏性影响，相对于各种市场失败来说都不重要。他的学生包括克鲁格曼和斯蒂格利茨，显然受到了萨缪尔森对市场的自然怀疑的影响。
- en: 'But, he had good faith, and was a disciplined, honest, and thoughtful person.
    He avoided engaging in the ad hominem and bad faith assumptions that are so common
    in Krugman and Stiglitz''s op-eds (Samuelson wrote op-eds for Newsweek for a long
    time). Yet, he was wrong about the biggest issues in his main area of expertise.
    To me, this highlights that the really important truths in life aren''t black
    and white truths you can discern through sufficient effort and intelligence. It''s
    like giving a random person a big computer with a googleplex of RAM, CPU, and
    access to the internet: that person will not become productive with a high probability.
    Getting right answers seems based on some pre-deliberative assumptions, prejudices,
    and there I think his intuitions led him astray. Rest in peace.'

  zh: 但是他诚实守信，是一个有纪律，诚实，思维敏捷的人。他避免了陷入克鲁格曼和斯蒂格利茨常见的单个人攻击和恶意假设（萨缪尔森长时间为《新闻周刊》写专栏）。然而，在他主要专业领域的最重要问题上，他是错误的。对我来说，这突显出生活中真正重要的真相并不是你可以通过足够的努力和智力来辨识的黑白真相。这就像给一个随机人装上一个有谷歌内存、CPU和上网权限的大型计算机：这个人很有可能不会变得高效。得到正确的答案似乎基于一些预先思考的假设、偏见，而我认为他的直觉让他误入歧途。安息吧。
