- en: Both the June CPI and PPI came in hot and well ahead of expectations. There
    was the inevitable debate about the transitory nature of the price increases.
    Looking longer-term, however, the conventional models for explaining inflation
    have been unsatisfactory.

  zh: 六月份的消费者价格指数（CPI）和生产者价格指数（PPI）都表现强劲，远超预期。关于价格上涨的暂时性性质，引发了不可避免的讨论。然而，从更长远的角度来看，传统解释通货膨胀的模型并不令人满意。
- en: Notwithstanding the numerous failures by Japanese policymakers, consider the
    US as another example. Let's begin with fiscal policy. It is said that deficit
    spending would lead to currency devaluation and inflation in the manner of the
    Weimar Republic. Nothing could be further from the truth. The blue line represents
    federal government deficits as a percentage of GDP. Deficits began to balloon
    in the early 1980`s with the Reagan Revolution and continued during the Bush I
    era. Did inflation (purple line) explode upward?

  zh: 尽管日本政策制定者的失败案例无数，我们还是以美国为例来看。先从财政政策说起。有人说，赤字支出会导致货币贬值和通货膨胀，就像魏玛共和国一样。事实恰恰相反。蓝线代表联邦政府赤字占GDP的百分比。赤字从20世纪80年代初的里根革命开始膨胀，并在布什一世时期继续。通货膨胀（紫色线）是否急剧上升？
- en: Monetary policy had its own failure. Monetarist Theory, as popularized by Milton
    Friedman, was another model that backtested well but failed out of the box. Friedman
    postulated that the PQ=MV, where the Price X Quantity of goods and services (or
    GDP) = Money Supply X (Monetary) Velocity. Friedman theorized that, over the long
    run, monetary velocity is stable, and therefore money supply growth determines
    inflation. All central banks had to do was to control money growth in order to
    control inflation.

  zh: 货币政策也有其自身的失败之处。以米尔顿·弗里德曼为代表的经济学家推广的货币主义理论，是另一种在回测中表现良好但一出炉就失败的理论。弗里德曼假设PQ=MV，其中商品和服务（或GDP）的价格X数量=货币供应量X货币流通速度。弗里德曼理论认为，从长远来看，货币流通速度是稳定的，因此货币供应的增长决定了通货膨胀。所有中央银行所做的就是控制货币增长，以控制通货膨胀。
- en: It worked until about 1980\. Monetary velocity had been stable until about then.
    Money growth didn't generate inflation because monetary velocity fluctuated wildly.
    Growth in money supply, as measured by M1, was often matched by declines in velocity.
    The Fed could engineer money growth and inject liquidity into the financial system
    without creating inflation.

  zh: 这种方法一直有效，直到大约1980年。直到那时，货币流通速度都相对稳定。由于货币流通速度波动较大，货币增长并没有导致通货膨胀。以M1衡量的货币供应量的增长，通常伴随着流通速度的下降。美联储可以操纵货币增长，并向金融系统注入流动性，而不会引发通货膨胀。
