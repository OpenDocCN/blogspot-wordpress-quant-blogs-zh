- en: ': Let''s begin with an administrative note. In the absence of severe market
    volatility, this will be the last mid-week market update until the new year. I
    plan on taking a few days off at the end of the year. I plan to publish the usual
    two comments this weekend, follow by single comments each weekend after that.'

  zh: ：首先来个行政通知。在市场没有出现严重波动的情况下，这将是今年最后一个周中市场更新，直到新年。我计划在年底休息几天。我打算这个周末发布常规的两篇评论，之后每个周末发布一篇。
- en: It's always difficult to make definitive market comments on FOMC day, as initial
    market moves are often reversed on the next day. We can say that the bulls were
    disappointed by the market reaction to the soft CPI report. The S&P 500 rallied
    up to test the falling resistance trend line but failed. While the bulls fell
    short of pushing the index about resistance at 4100, the bears were also unable
    to push the market below support at 3900\. Tactically, all that's left is to wait
    for the Santa Claus rally.

  zh: 在FOMC会议当天做出明确的市场评论总是很困难，因为最初的市场走势常常在第二天被反转。我们可以说，多头对市场对软性CPI报告的反应感到失望。标普500指数上涨以测试下跌阻力趋势线，但失败了。尽管多头未能将指数推高至4100的阻力位，但空头也未能将市场推低至3900的支持位。从策略上讲，剩下的就是等待圣诞老人上涨行情。
- en: 2022 has been a difficult year for investors. The silver lining is this environment
    conducive to tax-loss selling. When the tax-loss sales abate, it becomes a setup
    for the Santa Claus rally, which begins the day after Christmas and ends the second
    day of the new year.

  zh: 2022年对投资者来说是艰难的一年。好的一面是这种环境有利于税务亏损销售。税务亏损销售结束后，就为圣诞老人上涨行情做好了准备，该行情从圣诞节后一天开始，到新年第二天结束。
