  zh: 本周关于拥有投资流程的重要性，尽管他并没有完全这么说。哈斯曼说，存在反应性投资者和响应性投资者：
- en: '[A] reactive investor tends to reverse existing investment positions only when
    provoked by pain. Investment positions are sold when they have declined enough
    to trigger fear or panic. Investment positions are purchased in a rush to “catch”
    or “ride” them. My impression is that the single best mark of a reactive investor
    is the tendency to measure investment success by the amount gained or lost on
    any particular day.'

  zh: 然后是那些有投资流程和纪律的人：
- en: In contrast, the investor who responds puts much more emphasis on daily actions
    than on daily outcomes. That doesn't mean ignoring outcomes, but it means following
    a specific, well-studied discipline with the expectation that the results will
    emerge through repeated application. As usual, those results are best measured
    in terms of long-term return and risk over the complete market cycle.

  zh: 相比之下，响应性投资者更注重日常行动而非日常结果。这并不意味着忽视结果，而是意味着遵循一种特定的、经过充分研究的规定，期望通过反复应用来实现结果。像往常一样，这些结果最好以整个市场周期内的长期回报和风险来衡量。
- en: In other words, a responsive investor has a discipline. He responds to the changes
    in his models and indicators and adjusts his portfolio according to a discipline.
