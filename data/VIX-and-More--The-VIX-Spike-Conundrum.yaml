- en: I have been absolutely astonished by the number of comments I have seen in the
    past few days to the effect that right now is an excellent time to initiate new
    long positions on VIX options. I am still not sure what is behind most of this
    thinking, but it seems as if quite a few investors are excited about the VIX breakout,
    some have adopted a Roubiniesque pervasive pessimism and others clearly are still
    operating under the shadow of the 2008 volatility spikes.

  zh: 过去几天里，我对看到的大量评论感到绝对惊讶，这些评论认为现在是一个 excellent time to initiate new long positions
    on VIX options 的好时机。我仍然不确定大多数这种想法背后的原因是什么，但似乎有很多投资者对VIX的突破感到兴奋，一些人采取了Roubini式的普遍悲观态度，而其他人显然仍然在2008年波动率尖峰的阴影下操作。
- en: For all those who think that a [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    of 50% is a good time to get long the VIX, my response is that your ship has already
    sailed.

- en: I gave this post the title of *The VIX Spike Conundrum* because like a hot [Chinese
    solar stock](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/chinese-solar-stocks-on-rise.html),
    a rising VIX seems to be attracting the momentum crowd. Betting that a 50% rise
    in the VIX is just the beginning of a larger move is a sucker’s bet. In the event
    that readers find the data in the two studies linked at the bottom of this post
    not to be sufficiently compelling, I have added a new study that looks at what
    happens to the VIX following the first time it spikes high enough to close above
    30\. Not surprisingly, it is yet another example of [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    at work.

  zh: 我给这篇文章起了个标题叫做*VIX尖峰难题*，因为就像一支[中国太阳能股票](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/chinese-solar-stocks-on-rise.html)一样，一个上升的VIX似乎正在吸引趋势投资者。赌VIX的50%上涨只是更大涨幅的开始是一个愚蠢的赌注。万一读者发现本文底部链接的两个研究中的数据不够有说服力，我增加了一项新的研究，研究VIX在首次尖峰高到足以收盘价超过30点之后会发生什么。不出所料，这又是[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)在起作用的一个例子。
- en: The graphic below is a histogram that summarizes the future VIX action after
    an initial close above 30\. Of the 51 instances the VIX closed above 30 without
    having closed above 30 in the previous session, 18 times the VIX closed below
    30 on the next day and an additional 12 instances reflect the VIX closing below
    30 two days hence. This means that 59% of the time the VIX has surrendered the
    full distance of the close above 30 as well as some additional territory in just
    two days. Looking out four days, the VIX has already closed below 30 some 75%
    of the time, as is shown by the dotted red line.

  zh: 下面的图表是一个直方图，它总结了VIX在首次收盘价超过30点之后的未来走势。在51个VIX未在前一交易日收盘价超过30点的情况下首次收盘价超过30点的实例中，有18次VIX在次日收盘价低于30点，另外还有12个实例反映出VIX在两天后收盘价低于30点。这意味着有59%的时间VIX在两天内就放弃了收盘价超过30点的全部距离以及一些额外的领土。展望四天后的情况，VIX的收盘价已经低于30点大约75%，正如虚线红色所示。
- en: Note that while 84.3% of the time the VIX has already closed below 30 just six
    days later, the remaining 15.7% of the instances can make or break a trader. Six
    times (11.8%) the VIX has remained above the 30 level for at least 23 consecutive
    days following the first close above 30\. This is slightly more than one full
    options cycle. Prior to October 2008, traders who were short VIX calls could reasonably
    expect that the VIX was not going to spike any higher than 45, which was the [all-time
    record in the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/top-five-vix-spikes.html)
    at that time. Now that we have had front row seats to witness the VIX spike above
    80 on two separate occasions, I suspect investors overestimate the likelihood
    of a VIX spike of this magnitude happening again. Short of another acute systemic
    threat, I would be quite surprised to see the VIX rising over the 45 level.

  zh: 请注意，虽然有84.3%的时间VIX在六天后已经收盘低于30，但剩下的15.7%的案例可能会使交易员盈利或亏损。在六次（11.8%）的情况下，VIX在首次收盘高于30后至少连续23天保持在30以上。这比一个完整的期权周期略多。在2008年10月之前，那些做空VIX看涨期权的交易者可以合理地预期VIX不会高于45，在当时这是[VIX的历史最高记录](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/top-five-vix-spikes.html)。现在我们已经亲眼见证了VIX在两次不同的情况下超过了80，我怀疑投资者高估了VIX再次出现这种规模飙升的可能性。除非有另一个急性系统性威胁，否则我会非常惊讶看到VIX上涨超过45的水平。
- en: In the current market environment, the odds favor short volatility positions,
    such as [bear call spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread)
    on the VIX. Long positions in VIX calls are not just low probability plays, but
    they are very expensive as well. I don’t mind, however, if speculators are eager
    to gobble these up, as I am glad to have a ready audience to buy some VIX calls.

  zh: 在当前市场环境下，做空波动率的概率有利于短线操作，比如对VIX进行[熊市看涨期权 spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread)。持有VIX看涨期权的长期操作并不仅仅是低概率事件，而且它们也非常昂贵。然而，如果投机者急于买入这些期权，我并不介意，因为我很高兴有一个现成的买家来购买一些VIX看涨期权。
