- en: 'I was very sad to hear the news that Steve Jobs- the  former CEO of Apple Computer–
    passed away today.  His life was an incredible story of innovation, and the ability
    to triumph in the face of constant adversity. The legacy that he left cannot possibly
    be missed– you can’t walk outside or inside for more than a minute without seeing
    someone use an Apple product. There is literally no other consumer brand in the
    world that enjoys the same degree of loyalty and enthusiasm as Apple Computer.
    There is a good reason for that: Steve Jobs was focused on creating the best products
    with no compromises—even at the expense of delaying a launch in a world driven
    by quarterly earnings. Furthermore, he furnished these products with  functionality
    that consumers  didn’t know they needed until it was available. Jobs did not focus
    on market research and on providing customers with what they wanted, instead he
    brought them products from his unique vision of the future. It was the act of
    daring to be different, and focusing on value  instead of money that set Jobs
    and Apple far away from the competition.'

  zh: 听到苹果公司前CEO史蒂夫·乔布斯今天去世的消息，我感到非常悲伤。他的一生是创新的不可思议的故事，以及在持续逆境中取得胜利的能力。他留下的遗产是无法被忽视的——你无法走出或走进一分钟以上而不看到有人使用苹果产品。世界上没有任何其他消费品牌能像苹果电脑一样享有同样程度的忠诚度和热情。这背后有一个很好的理由：史蒂夫·乔布斯专注于创造没有妥协的最佳产品，甚至以延迟发布为代价，而这是在一个由季度收益驱动的世界里。此外，他为这些产品提供了消费者在产品推出之前根本不知道自己需要的功能。乔布斯不专注于市场调研和提供客户想要的东西，而是带给他们他对未来的独特愿景中的产品。他敢于与众不同，并专注于价值而不是金钱，这使得乔布斯和苹果在竞争中遥遥领先。
- en: This philosophy extends to all industries, and especially those that are driven
    by intense competition, technology and innovation. Of course, quantitative investing
    fits in perfectly within this category. So what can we learn from Steve Jobs?
    He was a man that wasn’t fond of rules or the status quo. Jobs would run his business
    based on his vision of how technology would evolve in the future rather than how
    it actually was in the present. He was willing to risk everything in order to
    best shape his products with this vision.  If he were in finance he would quickly
    recognize that greatest rewards will accrue to those that can create innovative
    algorithms or technology. It is very easy to imagine him seeing the value in a
    quantitative approach to investing.  Furthermore, Jobs would spend less time studying
    what others are doing in the field and focus on taking a completely novel approach.
    He would hire talent and promote risk-taking at every level of the organization.
    Furthermore he would invest extensively in research and development and avoid
    using a management accounting approach to evaluating its budget.

  zh: 这种哲学观念延伸到了所有行业，尤其是那些由激烈竞争、技术和创新驱动的行业。当然，量化投资完全符合这一类别。那么我们从史蒂夫·乔布斯身上能学到什么呢？他是一个不喜欢规则或现状的人。乔布斯经营企业的基础是他对未来技术发展的愿景，而不是当下的实际情况。他愿意冒一切风险，以最佳方式塑造他的产品。如果他在金融领域，他很快就会意识到，最大的回报将归属于那些能够创造创新算法或技术的人。很容易想象他认识到量化投资方法的价值。此外，乔布斯会花更少的时间研究其他人在该领域的做法，而是专注于采用完全新颖的方法。他会雇用人才，并在组织的每个层面上提倡冒险。此外，他会大量投资于研发，并避免使用管理会计方法来评估其预算。
- en: 'In the world of “quant” investing today,there are several major barriers to
    duplicate this approach: 1) a  true lack of diverse and creative talent 2)a lack
    of  consistent commitment to an ongoing research and development 3) embedded philosophical
    barriers to innovation .  The first problem is driven by the type of “left-brained”
    people that are attracted to and consistently employed in finance:  math, engineering
    and physics. This makes sense because of the high intellectual and technical barriers
    that exist in modern quantitative finance. However, the saturation of Phds and
    math wizards creates a talent pool that often lacks both diversity and creativity.
    While it is true that creativity can come from any background, it is certainly
    less likely to come from those that have cognitive wiring that is the polar opposite
    of those people that are typically artistic and creative.'

  zh: 在当今的“量化”投资世界中，要复制这种方法存在几个主要障碍：1）真正缺乏多样化和创造性人才；2）缺乏对持续的研究和开发的一致承诺；3）嵌入式对创新的哲学障碍。第一个问题是由那些被吸引并且经常在金融领域工作的“左脑”人士所驱动的：数学、工程和物理。这是有道理的，因为现代量化金融存在着高度的智力和技术壁垒。然而，PhD和数学天才的饱和创造了一个人才库，往往缺乏多样性和创造性。虽然创造力可以来自任何背景，但显然不太可能来自那些认知方式与通常具有艺术和创造力的人截然相反的人们。
- en: Another challenge is that it is much more difficult to tangibly measure the
    value of financial innovation unless one is committed to the process. It is easy
    to measure the value of programmers or the mathematicians that create core programs.
    In contrast, adding alpha requires incrementally longer time frames to evaluate
    accurately as the trading frequency becomes lower. However, evaluation is a critical
    part of business decisions to increase R&D expenditures. That explains why hedge
    funds,high frequency firms and investment banks continue to hire top scientists
    while the rest of the investment industry fails to invest in talent.

  zh: 另一个挑战是，除非一个人致力于这个过程，否则很难切实衡量金融创新的价值。衡量程序员或创建核心程序的数学家的价值是很容易的。相比之下，添加alpha需要逐渐更长的时间框架才能准确评估，因为交易频率变低。然而，评估是增加研发支出的关键部分。这就解释了为什么对冲基金、高频交易公司和投资银行继续聘用顶尖科学家，而其他投资行业则未能投资于人才。
- en: A final achilles heel resides in the psychological, political, and philosophical
    barriers to innovation. In all areas of finance, the cost of miscalculation or
    being “wrong” is so high that human nature causes us to seek out those who are
    less likely to screw up the math. Having worked with many Phds and other bright
    individuals, the fear of being wrong or even doing math that is not conventional
    is so strong and pervasive that they are psychologically unwilling to break from
    convention. Of course, the very essence of the creative  process requires risking
    being incredibly wrong in order to find a better way to do something. This can
    mean that a quant can lose their job for introducing a novel idea that doesn’t
    pan out, but will probably keep their job if they use GARCH or Fama-French and
    mess up. Clearly between the type of employee that gets hired, fear of math mistakes,
    and  the obvious politics involved, innovation has many hurdles to overcome.

  zh: 最后一个致命弱点存在于对创新的心理、政治和哲学障碍。在金融的所有领域，错误的成本是如此之高，以至于人类的本性使我们寻找那些不太可能搞砸数学的人。与许多PhD和其他聪明的个人一起工作后，我们发现害怕错误甚至进行非传统数学计算的恐惧是如此强烈和普遍，以至于他们心理上不愿意打破常规。当然，创造过程的核心本质要求冒着极大错误的风险，以找到更好的做事方式。这意味着，如果量化分析师提出的新颖想法没有结果，可能会失去工作，但如果他们使用GARCH或Fama-French并搞砸了，他们很可能会保住工作。显然，在被雇佣的员工类型、对数学错误的恐惧以及明显涉及的政治之间，创新面临着许多障碍。
- en: We need to stop worrying about being wrong— in a competitive game there is no
    alpha in  being conventional and avoiding mistakes. There is no such thing as
    the “right” way to do anything anymore. In quantum physics we are continually
    exposed to how little concrete information we truly possess. Why should a vastly
    more unpredictable field be any different? Determinism and mathematical proofs
    are rapidly losing their value in finance. There is no fixed reality, and the
    highly dimensional nature financial problems today require both tremendous statistical
    skills but also the unique and artistic insights that drive the hypotheses to
    be tested. The new brand of quant firms that will succeed will integrate both
    approaches under one roof.

  zh: 我们需要停止担心犯错——在竞争激烈的游戏中，传统与避免错误并不意味着优势。再也没有所谓的“正确”做事的方法了。在量子物理学中，我们不断暴露于我们真正拥有的微薄具体信息的范围。为什么一个更加不可预测的领域会有所不同呢？确定论和数学证明正在金融领域迅速失去其价值。没有固定的现实，而当今金融问题的高维度性质需要巨大的统计技能，同时也需要驱动假设进行测试的独特和艺术性的洞察力。成功的新一代量化公司将在一个屋檐下融合这两种方法。
