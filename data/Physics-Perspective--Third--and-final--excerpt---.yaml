    reason similar kinds of predictions shouldn't be possible in finance and economics.
    Of course, people make such predictions all the time about financial events already.
    I'm merely suggesting that with effort and the devotion of considerable resources

- en: Not only were the Macroeconomists looking at the wrong markets, they might have
    been looking at the wrong variables. John Geanakoplos (2003, 2010a, 2010b) has
    argued that leverage and collateral, not interest rates, drove the economy in
    the crisis of 2007-2009, pushing housing prices and mortgage securities prices
    up in the bubble of 2000-2006, then precipitating the crash of 2007\. Geanakoplos
    has also argued that the best way out of the crisis is to write down principal
    on housing loans that are underwater (see Geanakoplos-Koniak (2008, 2009) and
    Geanakoplos (2010b)), on the grounds that the loans will not be repaid anyway,
    and that taking into account foreclosure costs, lenders could get as much or almost
    as much money back by forgiving part of the loans, especially if stopping foreclosures
    were to lead to a rebound in housing prices.

  zh: 不仅宏观经济学家研究了错误的市场，他们可能还研究了错误的变量。约翰·盖纳科波洛斯（2003, 2010a, 2010b）认为，在2007-2009年的危机中，是杠杆和抵押品，而不是利率推动了经济，在2000-2006年的泡沫中推高了房价和抵押证券价格，然后导致了2007年的崩溃。盖纳科波洛斯还认为走出危机的最好方式是对处于水下（即贷款余额高于房产价值）的住房贷款进行本金减记（参见盖纳科波洛斯-科尼亚克（2008,
    2009）和盖纳科波洛斯（2010b）），因为这些贷款反正也还不了，考虑到止赎成本，如果取消部分贷款，贷款人可以得到同样多或者几乎同样多的钱，特别是如果停止止赎会促使房价反弹。

    bubble caused by low interest rates, irrational exuberance, low lending standards,
    too much refinancing, people not imagining something, or too much leverage? Leverage
    is the main variable that went up and down along with housing prices. But how
    can one rule out the other explanations, or quantify which is more important?
    What effect would principal forgiveness have on housing prices? How much would
    that increase (or decrease) losses for investors? How does one quantify the answer

    building equilibrium models with a representative agent, or a very small number
    of representative agents. Regressions are run on aggregate data, like average
    interest rates or average leverage. The results so far seem mixed. Edward Glaeser,
    Joshua Gottlieb, and Joseph Gyourko (2010) argue that leverage did not play an
    important role in the run-up of housing prices from 2000-2006\. John Duca, John
    Muellbauer, and Anthony Murphy (2011), on the other hand, argue that it did. Andrew
    Haughwout et al (2011) argue that leverage played a pivotal role.

    that is, a model in which we try to simulate the behavior of literally every household
    in the economy. The household sector consists of hundreds of millions of individuals,
    with tremendous heterogeneity, and a small number of transactions per month. Conventional
    models cannot accurately calibrate heterogeneity and the role played by the tail
    of the distribution. ... only after we know what the wealth and income is of each
    household, and how they make their housing decisions, can we be confident in answering
    questions like: How many people could afford one house who previously could afford
    none? Just how many people bought extra houses because they could leverage more
    easily? How many people spent more because interest rates became lower? Given
    transactions costs, what expectations could fuel such a demand? Once we answer
    questions like these, we can resolve the true cause of the housing boom and bust,
    and what would happen to housing prices if principal were forgiven.'

    只有在我们知道每个家庭的财富和收入，以及他们如何做出购房决定后，我们才能自信地回答问题，比如：有多少人能承担得起一套房子，而之前承担不起？有多少人因为更容易融资而购买了额外的房子？有多少人因为利率降低而花费更多？考虑到交易成本，什么预期能刺激这样的需求？一旦我们回答了这些问题，我们就能解决房地产繁荣和崩溃的真实原因，以及如果免除本金，房价会发生什么变化。

    so much more data. Aside from passing a basic plausibility test (which is crucial
    in any model), the agent-based approach allows for many more variables to be fit,
    like vacancy rates, time on market, number of renters versus owners, ownership
    rates by age, race, wealth, and income, as well as the average housing prices
    used in standard models. Most importantly, perhaps, one must be able to check
    that basically the same behavioral parameters work across dozens of different
    cities. And then at the end, one can do counterfactual reasoning: what would have
    happened had the Fed kept interest rates high, what would happen with this behavioral
