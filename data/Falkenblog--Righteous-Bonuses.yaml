- en: about the size of bonuses handed out when banks are getting a federal bailout,
    but not every bonus is undeserved, so it is not as easy as saying there should
    be zero bonuses until things are fixed. They key is how close they were to the
    decision making process. If someone in charge of a complex portfolio has his bonus
    cut back to zero, implying his future bonuses are also in peril, he has good reason
    to bolt and start at a new place. Worse, he has an incentive to screw up his portfolio
    by giving away securities to friends of his on the Street (brokers, other traders
    he deals with), building up a set of favors for his next position. Once there,
    the buddies he sold securities to at 72 when they were trading at 78 will remember
    him.

  zh: 关于在银行获得联邦救助时发放的奖金规模，但并非所有奖金都不应受到推崇，因此不像那么简单就说在问题解决之前应该一分奖金都不发。关键在于他们与决策过程有多接近。如果负责一个复杂投资组合的人的奖金被削减到零，暗示着他的未来奖金也岌岌可危，他有充分的理由离开并在新地方重新开始。更糟糕的是，他有动机通过把证券送给他在华尔街的朋友（经纪人，其他他交易的交易员）来搞砸他的投资组合，为他下一个职位积累一系列恩惠。到了那个时候，他卖掉证券时的只要72美元，而交易时是78美元的朋友们会记得他。
- en: The reason we pay people a lot is because we think they are worth it. Many times
    they are not, but not always. A fund I know shut down one of its funds and people
    there basically gave away their positions before they left, making payments to
    the favor bank, for when they went to their new jobs. Why? They were told there
    would be no bonus, just exit your positions, and get your 1 month severance. A
    zero bonus is a horrible incentive structure for someone in charge of a portfolio,
    and it is not feasible to think your back office or audit group can monitor this.
    The portfolio managers know the best price, outsiders don't, that's why they get
    paid a lot. In the context of a moving market, and illiquid securities (such as
    mortgages), you don't really know how much money you are leaving on the table,
    but look at the incentives at the individual level, and expect people to act in
    their self interest.

  zh: 我们之所以付给人们很多钱是因为我们认为他们是值得的。很多时候他们并不是，但并不总是如此。我知道一个基金关闭了其中的一个基金，那里的人基本上在离开之前放弃了他们的头寸，在他们离开前向恩惠银行做了付款,
    为了当他们转到新的工作时。为什么？因为他们被告知不会有奖金，只需要平仓，然后拿到1个月的离职费。对于一个负责投资组合的人来说，零奖金是一个可怕的激励结构，并且你的后勤部门或审计小组无法监控这一点。投资组合经理知道最好的价格，外人不知道，这就是为什么他们获得了很多报酬。在一个波动市场和流动性较差的证券（比如抵押贷款）的情况下，你真的不知道你在离开时有多少钱，但看看个人层面上的激励措施，并期望人们为了自身利益行事。
- en: 'Many times, bonuses are layered: the PM gets 10%, his boss gets 10% or the
    CEO gets another 10%. Infamous trader Joseph Jett made $9MM in his 1993 bonus
    (off fraudulent profits), and had to pay it back. His boss, Ed Cerullo, got $20MM
    in bonus that year in large part because of those same fraudulent profits. Cerullo
    was worse that Jett in that he not only had no idea what Jett was doing, but got
    paid more than Jett based on his activities, then was not held accountable (Cerullo
    paid a $50k fine and did not pay back any of his bonus)! This is why we mock ''management''.
    These higher ups can and should be squeezed.'

  zh: 很多时候，奖金是分层的：投资组合经理得到10%，他的老板得到10%，或者首席执行官再得到10%。臭名昭著的交易员约瑟夫·杰特在1993年的奖金中赚取了900万美元（以欺诈利润为基础），并不得不返还。他的老板埃德·塞鲁洛在同一年大部分是因为同样的欺诈利润得到了2000万美元的奖金。塞鲁洛比杰特更糟糕，因为他不仅不知道杰特在做什么，而且基于他的活动得到了比杰特更多的酬金，然后他也没有被追究责任（塞鲁洛只交了5万美元的罚款，没有返还他的任何奖金）！这就是为什么我们嘲笑'管理层'。这些高管可以而且应该受到逼迫。
- en: Fundamentally, there is a continuum of rents earned from capital to labor. Those
    with special knowledge, or whose effort is difficult to monitor (even ex post),
    has alpha, because you can't necessarily replace him with a wage slave. Those
    with alpha negotiate with those with capital to share the proceeds of their venture,
    and they should be thought of as movie stars, those with talent, that get paid
    a bunch, but they aren't management, they aren't making strategic decisions. Management
    is sort of in the middle between capital and alpha, so there needs to be a judgment
    call as to how much these guys should make, but they generally aren't alpha producers.
    They tend to be overpaid, because they used to be on the front lines, and now
    manage those people, and using logic similar to a union (more senior people get
    paid more), think that anyone managing others should get paid more than them,
    via a cut of all their books. This is generally overdone, only because those setting
    their pay usually need the support of these managers, making it difficult to cut
    their pay. In these times, it would be a very good place to start docking all
    those Executive Vice President and Head of Global Market Derivatives, because
    there are lots of replacements on the street.

  zh: 从根本上讲，从资本到劳动力都有一种收入的连续性。那些具有特殊知识或者努力很难监督的人（即使事后监督），就有“阿尔法”，因为你不能用一名廉价劳动力代替他。拥有“阿尔法”的人和有资本的人谈判，分享他们事业的收益，他们应该被看作是电影明星，那些有才华的人，得到了很多报酬，但他们并非管理层，他们不做战略决策。管理层处于资本和“阿尔法”之间，所以需要对这些人应该拿多少工资做出评判，但他们通常不是“阿尔法”的生产者。他们往往是被过度支付的，因为他们过去曾经在一线，现在管理着那些人，并且使用类似于工会的逻辑（更高级的人得到更多报酬），认为任何管理他人的人，都应该得到比他们更多的报酬，通过分得他们所有书籍的一部分。这通常是做得过分了，仅仅因为那些设置他们工资的人通常需要这些经理的支持，因此很难减少他们的工资。在这种时候，开始扣减那些执行副总裁和全球市场衍生品主管的工资会是一个非常好的开始，因为街上有很多替代者。
- en: John Thain, doesn't need a bonus, nor any of his direct reports. But leave the
    lower level guys alone, regardless of their take. It may not be fair (isn't a
    schoolteacher worth more?), but they are in a position to do a lot of damage if
    you zero them out. These are the Atlases you don't want shrugging.

  zh: John Thain，不需要任何奖金，他的下属们也是一样。但是要放过那些低层次的员工，不管他们拿多少也都是一样的。这也许不太公平（一个学校老师不值得更多吗？），但是如果把他们的薪水归零，他们可能会造成很大的损害。这些人是你不想放纵的“阿特拉斯”。
