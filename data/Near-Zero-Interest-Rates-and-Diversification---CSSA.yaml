    and the benefits of diversification. When rates are close to zero, the risk reduction
    benefits from low or anti-correlated assets can offset the requirement for those
    assets to have a sufficient expected return to make diversification practical
    for enhancing risk adjusted returns. This extends to all assets– including those
    that do not have a theoretical risk premium such as certain commodities and currencies.
    Conversely when the risk-free rate is high, it is nearly impossible to justify
    diversification with the exception of those assets that can be assured of producing
    a risk premium. In this case, only stocks, bonds and real estate would qualify
    as assets that should produce a return in excess of the risk-free rate since their
    pricing is inherently tied to the cost of borrowing/lending.

  zh: 有一种有趣的关系存在于“无风险”利率（国库券利率）和多样化的益处之间。当利率接近零时，来自低相关或反相关资产的风险降低益处可以抵消这些资产必须具有足够预期收益以使多样化对增加风险调整后的回报实际可行的要求。这适用于所有资产——包括那些没有理论风险溢价的资产，比如某些大宗商品和货币。相反，当无风险利率高时，几乎不可能证明多样化的理由，除了那些可以确保产生风险溢价的资产。在这种情况下，只有股票、债券和房地产才有资格产生超过无风险利率的回报，因为它们的定价与借贷成本密切相关。
- en: It is conventional wisdom that gold  should not have a risk premium, and historically
    this has been true though this is a separate debate. What is more important is
    that gold carries a negative correlation to other assets, and thus in a low or
    zero interest rate environment it does not need to have much of an expected return
    in order to improve portfolio risk-adjusted returns. Consider that holding standard
    deviation constant,  an asset with a -.5 correlation reduces portfolio risk by
    50%. That means that gold returns can be up to 50% lower than all other asset
    returns and still improve the portfolio sharpe.  The same principle holds true
    for all assets that have low or negative correlations to equities.  This  substantially
    increases the pool of assets that would qualify for inclusion in a properly diversified
    portfolio. The lower the correlation, and the lower the expected return of equities,
    the lower the expected return hurdle for assets without risk premiums need to
    be to improve risk-adjusted performance.  This means that expected returns that
    are zero or even negative can potentially qualify such assets for an efficient
    portfolio.  Of course, this is a “special situation” that occurs in the rare circumstances
    where interest rates are near zero. Thus the conventional approach of focusing
    only on assets that have a risk premium in all environments is a flawed approach.
    A superior approach would consider the dynamics of interest rates and all asset
    correlations along with a possible range of expected returns.

  zh: 众所周知，黄金不应该有风险溢价，从历史上看这是正确的，尽管这是一个单独的争论。更重要的是，黄金与其他资产呈负相关，因此在低利率或零利率环境下，它不需要有太多的预期收益，就可以提高投资组合的风险调整收益。考虑到标准差保持不变，一个具有
    -.5 相关性的资产将使投资组合风险降低 50%。这意味着黄金回报可以低于所有其他资产回报高达 50%，但仍然能改善投资组合的夏普比率。对于所有与股票低相关性或负相关性的资产都适用同样的原则。这大大增加了符合适当多样化投资组合条件的资产池。相关性越低，股票的预期回报越低，无风险溢价资产的预期回报门槛就越低，以改善风险调整后的绩效。这意味着预期回报为零甚至为负的资产也有可能符合高效投资组合的条件。当然，这是一种“特殊情况”，只发生在利率接近零的罕见情况下。因此，只关注在所有环境中都有风险溢价资产的传统方法是一种有缺陷的方法。一个更优越的方法应该考虑利率的动态以及所有资产之间的相关性以及可能的预期回报范围。
