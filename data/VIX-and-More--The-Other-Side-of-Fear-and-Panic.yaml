- en: Joshua Brown at [The Reformed Broker](http://thereformedbroker.com/) has a nice
    piece out this morning (hat tip, [Trader Mike](http://tradermike.net/)) with the
    playful title of [The Five Stages of Panic Buying](http://thereformedbroker.com/2009/08/27/the-five-stages-of-panic-buying/).
    Brown illustrates each of the five stages with quotes from through the investment
    management world and in so doing has reconstructed something of a psychological
    history of the current bull market. Both bulls and bears are encouraged to click
    through to get a chuckle out of what has been going on in the head of investors
    for the past 5-6 months.

  zh: 乔舒亚·布朗在[The Reformed Broker](http://thereformedbroker.com/)上发表了这篇今晨的文章（感谢[Trader
    Mike](http://tradermike.net/)的提示），标题很有趣，叫做[恐慌性买入的五个阶段](http://thereformedbroker.com/2009/08/27/the-five-stages-of-panic-buying/)。布朗通过引用投资管理世界的名言，为当前牛市的心理历程重建了某种历史。无论是多头还是空头，都鼓励点击查看投资者在过去5-6个月里头脑中发生的事情。
- en: The underlying theme of all five stages is that on Wall Street, where annual
    bonuses are typically doled out based on performance relative to a benchmark,
    investment managers loathe the idea of falling behind that benchmark early in
    the year and having to play catch-up for the balance of the year. Particularly
    in a year when the market starts down then reverses sharply to the upside, one
    would expect that a large majority of investment managers would find themselves
    chasing performance, becoming more aggressive and taking on more risk in order
    to reel in the benchmark.

  zh: 五个阶段的背后主题是，在华尔街，年度奖金通常是根据相对于基准的表现来分配的，投资经理们非常讨厌年初落后于基准，并不得不在余下的时间里追赶基准。特别是在市场开始下跌然后急剧反转上升的年份，大多数人可能会发现自己追逐业绩，变得更加积极，承担更多风险，以赶上基准。
- en: Of course, panic buying is not the flip side of panic selling. Panic buying
    favors the use of more derivatives, more leverage, more beta and less cash. It
    shows up on charts as aggressive buying on the dip, the failure of stocks to retrace
    earlier gains, etc. and is part of the reason why the 10 day [rate of change](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rate%20of%20change)
    (ROC) in the chart below has yet to fall below -5 (%) since the rally began.

  zh: 当然，恐慌性买入并不是恐慌性卖出的反面。恐慌性买入倾向于使用更多的衍生品、更多的杠杆、更多的贝塔和更少的现金。它在图表上表现为在大盘下跌时的积极买入，股票未能回补早期涨幅等，这也是自反弹开始以来，图表下方的10日[变化率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rate%20of%20change)（ROC）尚未降至-5%（以下）以下的原因之一。
- en: What I find particularly interesting is that I believe panic buying is more
    likely to lead to crowded trades and ultimately to panic selling. There have not
    been many days in which we have seen big drops in the SPX and there has certainly
    been no extended weakness in stocks since the March bottom, but I suspect that
    when the market finally does turn, those same panic buyers will be quick to lock
    in gains in hopes of keeping pace with or finally overtaking the appropriate benchmark.

  zh: 我发现特别有趣的是，我相信恐慌性买入更有可能导致拥挤的交易，并最终导致恐慌性卖出。在我们看到标普500指数大幅下跌的日子并不多，自3月份底部以来股票市场确实没有出现持续的弱势，但我怀疑当市场最终转向时，那些同样的恐慌性买家会迅速锁定收益，希望与或最终超过适当的基准。
- en: So…if we have many panic buyers who have been chasing performance with long
    positions of questionable underlying value, then the potential for some high volatility
    trading in the next month or so may be higher than recent stock market activity
    has led many to believe.

  zh: 所以……如果我们有很多追逐业绩的恐慌性买家，他们持有的多头头寸的内在价值值得怀疑，那么在未来一个月或几个月里，市场波动性高的交易潜力可能比最近的股市活动所暗示的要高。
