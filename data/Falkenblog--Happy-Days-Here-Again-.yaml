- en: Fannie and Freddie are still cash flow positive, yet that have had huge write
    downs, and as they have to refinance a bunch of debt, they need the market to
    think these companies have positive book value, or a guarantee from the government.
    The government stepping in, for 80% ownership, is a good move, because these institutions
    were truly too big to fail. One might think that they could have given less to
    the existing shareholders, but given current law, if you piss them off too much
    you can engender litigation, so one can not really 'wipe the shareholders out'
    as we would all like. If there is any consolation, they have lost a lot of money
    over the past year. But the bottom line is, that

  zh: Fannie和Freddie虽然现金流仍为正，但已遭受巨大减记，由于需要重组大量债务，它们需要市场相信这些公司拥有正的账面价值，或得到政府的担保。政府介入，持有80%的股份，是一个明智之举，因为这些机构确实“大到不能倒”。有人可能会认为可以少给现有股东一些，但根据现行法律，如果过分激怒他们，可能会引发诉讼，所以我们不能像大家希望的那样“彻底清除股东”。如果有什么安慰的话，他们在过去一年中已经损失了很多钱。但底线是，

- en: Japan is up 3% right now, and it not clear where Fannie and Freddie are trading.
    At first there we down 20%, but are now about where they were on close. One must
    remember, these companies were worth 10 times what they are worth now last year,
    so being worth 20% of that, is still a bigger number than today's value.

  zh: 日本目前上涨了3%，而Fannie和Freddie的交易情况尚不明朗。起初它们下跌了20%，但现在基本回到了收盘时的水平。必须记住，这些公司去年价值是现在的10倍，所以即使现在价值是去年的20%，仍然比今天的价值要大。
