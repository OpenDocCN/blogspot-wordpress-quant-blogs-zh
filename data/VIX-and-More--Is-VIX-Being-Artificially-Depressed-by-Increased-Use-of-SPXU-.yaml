  zh: VIX持续下跌至25.00以下，让许多交易者包括本作者都感到意外。
- en: If one were to study last Friday’s [Forces Acting on the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/forces-acting-on-vix.html),
    it would not take long to determine that with very few exceptions, the fear and
    uncertainty associated with the forces in the graphic have been rapidly diminishing
    over the course of the past few months.

  zh: 如果研究一下上周五的[影响VIX的力量](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/forces-acting-on-vix.html)，很快就会确定，除了少数例外，图形中与力量相关的恐惧和不确定性在过去几个月里已经迅速减少。
- en: One of the forces that I mentioned has received very little attention and has
    likely been underestimated by traders – if accounted for at all. This is the growth
    of hedging substitutes for the SPX. As the VIX is strongly influenced by the demand
    for SPX puts, it stands to reason that any substitutes for SPX puts could ‘artificially’
    lower VIX levels by diverting demand to alternative hedging products. Historically,
    these substitutes have included futures, options and various forms of swaps. With
    the increased interest in ETFs and particularly leveraged ETFs, however, the menu
    of substitutes has increased dramatically.

  zh: 我提到的其中一个力量收到了非常少的关注，并且很可能被交易者们低估了——如果被考虑的话。这是SPX对冲替代品的增长。由于VIX强烈受到SPX看跌期权需求的影響，任何SPX看跌期权的替代品都可能通过将需求转向其他对冲产品而“人为”地降低VIX水平。历史上，这些替代品包括期货、期权和各种形式的掉期。然而，随着对ETF兴趣的增加，特别是杠杆ETF，替代品的菜单已经大幅增加。
- en: During the height of the financial crisis, [I documented](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/rising-popularity-of-xlf-options.html)
    how many investors were foregoing SPX and SPY puts in favor of options targeted
    specifically on the financial sector.

  zh: 在金融危机高峰期，[我记录了](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/rising-popularity-of-xlf-options.html)许多投资者是如何放弃SPX和SPY看跌期权，转而选择针对金融部门的看跌期权的。
- en: With the introduction of the bearish -3x Short ProShares ([SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU)),
    a [triple ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs) aimed
    at replicating -300% of the daily move in the SPX, I believe traders have found
    – and embraced – an alternative to SPX options that is starting to impact the
    VIX.

  zh: 随着看跌-3倍短期ProShares([SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU))的引入，一个旨在复制SPX每日300%波动的三倍ETF([triple
    ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs))，我相信交易者们已经找到了一种开始影响VIX的SPX期权的替代品，并且已经接受了它。
- en: The graphic below shows how the recent increased volume in the SPXU just happens
    to coincide with the decoupling of the VIX and the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN).
    The same factors are undoubtedly impacting volatility term structure as well and
    may explain some of the recent low readings in the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV).

  zh: 下面的图表显示了SPXU近期交易量的增加恰好与VIX和[VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)的分离一致。同样的因素无疑也在影响波动率期限结构，并且可能解释了最近[VIX:VXV比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)的低读数。
- en: I am leaving the title of the graphic as a rhetorical question for the moment,
    as one month of data will necessarily leave us far short of any sort of statistical
    proof. Do not be surprised, however, if SPXU and its +3x sibling [UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)
    continue to generate larger interest and volume, both as a hedging tool and as
    a speculative play. As leveraged ETFs based on the SPX increase their market share,
    interest in SPX puts – and absolute levels in the VIX– may see a significant decline.

  zh: 我暂时将图标的标题留作一个修辞问题，因为一个月的时间必然远远达不到任何统计证明。不过，如果SPXU及其+3倍兄弟[UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)继续吸引更多关注和交易量，无论是作为对冲工具还是作为投机性交易，不要感到惊讶。随着基于SPX的杠杆ETF市场份额的增加，对SPX看跌期权的兴趣——以及VIX的绝对水平——可能会显著下降。
