- en: While there were many important stories that broke this week, the one which
    found me briefly holding my breath was the failed auction of £1.75 billion in
    U.K. government 40-year bonds on Wednesday followed by the weak demand for $34
    billion of 5-year U.S. Treasury notes later in the day. While Thursday’s successful
    auction of $24 billion of 7-year U.S. Treasury notes has temporarily put the government
    debt auction issue on the back burner, the interest rate plot is clearly thickening
    – and the debate on deflation vs. inflation is starting to heat up.

  zh: 虽然本周有许多重要的故事发生，但让我暂时屏住呼吸的是英国政府40年期国债拍卖失败，以及随后对美国5年期国债的需求疲软。尽管周四成功拍卖了240亿美元的7年期美国国债暂时让国债拍卖问题退居次要位置，但利率的剧情显然在
    thickening —— 通缩与通胀的辩论开始升温。
- en: One excellent way to protect against inflation is through the use of Treasury
    Inflation-Protected Securities, more commonly known as [TIPS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TIPS).
    As I noted last September in [Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities and Inflationary
    Expectations](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/treasury-inflation-protected-securities.html),
    TIPS utilize the CPI as an inflationary benchmark and TIPS coupon payments and
    the underlying principal are automatically adjusted to account for inflation.

  zh: 对抗通胀的一个极好方法就是通过使用国债通胀保护证券，更 commonly known as [TIPS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TIPS)。正如我在去年9月提到的[国债通胀保护证券与通胀预期](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/treasury-inflation-protected-securities.html)，TIPS使用CPI作为通胀基准，TIPS的票息支付和本金会自动调整以反映通胀。
- en: All of this brings us to the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, which shows a ratio of the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund ETF ([TIP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TIP))
    to the [10-Year U.S. Treasury Note](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20Year%20Treasury%20Note).
    This ratio has seen several jolts in the last six or so months, but since mid-December,
    investors have shown a strong preference for TIPS over the standard Treasuries.
    In fact, as concern about inflation has elevated during the course of the last
    week or so, TIP, with an average maturity of approximately nine years, has moved
    up impressively while Treasuries with comparable maturities have fallen. The ratio
    is now approaching its pre-Lehman levels, so that further moves could help to
    gauge whether inflationary or deflationary fears are dominating the thinking of
    investors.

  zh: 所有这些都让我们来看一下下面的本周图表[TIP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TIP)与[10年期美国国债](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20Year%20Treasury%20Note)的比率，这个比率在过去六个月左右经历了几次震动，但自去年12月中旬以来，投资者明显偏好TIPS胜过标准的国债。事实上，随着上周对通胀的担忧加剧，TIP（平均到期时间约为9年）的表现令人印象深刻，而与之相当的国债却下跌了。这个比率现在正接近雷曼兄弟破产前的水平，因此进一步的变动可以帮助判断通胀或通缩的恐慌是否主导了投资者的思维。
