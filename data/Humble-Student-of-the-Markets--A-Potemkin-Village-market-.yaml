    one of the puzzles facing investors is why the US equity market testing its all-time
    highs even as the economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression.
    This market seems like a Potemkin Village, which shows an external façade of calm
    while hiding the real trouble behind the scenes.

  zh: 尽管股市非经济，经济亦非股市的说法是正确的。投资者面临的一个谜题是，为何美国股市在经济遭遇大萧条以来最严重的挫折时，却屡创新高。这个市场看起来就像是一个“波将金村”，表面上看似平静，实则背后隐藏着真正的麻烦。

    steps to stabilize markets so they can function in an orderly way. A Fed Put can
    put a floor on prices, but it cannot make asset prices skyrocket the way they
    did.

    a significant downside risk to our growth outlook,” JPMorgan Chase chief U.S.
    economist Michael Feroli wrote in a Monday note. “These executive orders likely
    will provide stimulus of less than $100 billion, while we have been expecting
    Congress to add at least $1.0-1.5 trillion of spending once an agreement is reached.”

    is inadequate, legally questionable and falls dramatically short of the booster
    shot the economy desperately needs,” per a note from senior U.S. economist Lydia
    Boussour. “In the absence of a more comprehensive stimulus package, economic activity
    will be constrained just as the recovery plateaus.”

- en: The so-called FAANGs (along with Microsoft) derive about half -- and in some
    cases even more -- of their revenue from abroad. Beyond that, the pandemic lockdown
    in the U.S. has benefitted the giant tech companies’ sales and profits. No wonder
    the Nasdaq Composite 100 Index, which is dominated by big tech companies, is up
    about 26% this year.

    are no longer tethered to reality because the performance doesn’t correspond to
    their personal experience, which is one of job loss, economic hardship and personal
