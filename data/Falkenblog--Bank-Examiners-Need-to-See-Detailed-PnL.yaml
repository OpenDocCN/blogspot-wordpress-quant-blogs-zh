    bank, leading to issues of adverse selection and moral hazard, as selective risky
    assets are rationalized as being on the ‘banking book’ instead of the ‘trading
    book’, so that the final top-down number excludes the majority of actual risk,
    and a biased majority at that. Another problem is that credit risk is still very
    difficult to measure in the VaR framework, so that given the particular collateral,
    obligor, and facility, can have a very different risk profile depending on details
    that banks are not obligated to supply, let alone validate. When you try to find

    just as important as risk measures--for measuring risk! This is because you could
    pair the income generated with your bottom up risk measure, and see if it was
    reasonable. Often, your risk measure was off by a factor of 3 because you forgot
    certain assets had guarantees, or had off-balance sheet exposures. Most of these
    errors weren’t subtle, they merely omitted a significant factor. Most complex
    problems, like examining the risk of a large financial institution, are not really
    fundamentally complex, merely detailed, and so getting good approximations was
    more a function of asking for the right set of details, rather than working out
    the mathematics of a complex non-recombining lattice. Secondly, the aggregate
    numbers were pretty irrelevant. The bottom-up, aggregate required capital estimate
    was so dependent on uncertain assumptions about correlations, and the relation
    between our franchise value versus the value of assets on and off our balance
    sheet, that it was rightfully ignored.

  zh: 当我在一家地区银行担任资本分配负责人时，我发现了风险管理文献中未提及的两个见解。首先，盈利报告和风险度量一样重要，用于衡量风险！这是因为你可以将产生的收入与你的自下而上的风险度量配对，看看是否合理。通常，你的风险度量会偏差
    3 倍，因为你忘记了某些资产有担保，或者有资产负债表之外的风险敞口。这些错误大多不是微妙的，它们只是忽略了一个重要因素。大多数复杂的问题，比如检查一个大型金融机构的风险，实际上并不是根本性复杂的，而只是详细的，所以获得良好的近似值更多是问正确的一组细节，而不是解决复杂的不可重组格点的数学问题。其次，总量数据相当无关紧要。自下而上的总资本估计非常依赖于关于相关性的不确定假设，以及我们的特许经营权价值与我们资产负债表上和下的资产价值之间的关系，因此理所当然地被忽略。

    revenue. While we should work to make these risk measures better, in the meantime,
    looking at metrics based partially on revenues is very informative. Indeed, the

    annualized 99% VaRs of about $1.8B in 2007, but still managed to lose an average

    a positive carry. There was an internal arb in the bank, in that almost any paper
    funded at such rates generates positive carry, and given the infrequent (but massive)

    residential mortgages from the US into mezzanine (e.g., Ba rated) CDOs and reselling
    them. This generated fees of 125 to 150 basis points, compared to fees of only
    40 basis points on senior tranches. But the 150 basis points on the mezzanine
    piece necessitated keeping 60% of the RMBS on their books, the senior pieces.
    These assets supported great trading revenue, but if there were properly funded
    and assessed the appropriate capital, it would have been obvious that while 150
    basis points is great business, the costs generated by warehousing the supporting
    collateral put a limit on how much of this stuff was optimal. Instead, the residual
    assets warehoused seemed to have a positive NIACC (equal to an above-hurdle rate
    Sharpe), and thus at the margin added to the bank’s value, so there was effectively
    no limit to how much was optimal: as many as their mezzanine CDO group could sell.
    But no matter whether these senior piece were put in a separate business line,
    or kept within the group generating the restructuring fees, it would have set
    off red flags that a liquid and large asset class like RMBS was capable of generating
    significant alpha. Like taking 50 basis points out of a Treasury Bill trade, some
    familiarity with the spreads and returns of these assets suggests that some large

    bonds are still ‘investment grade’, and have only a 4.7% 10 year cumulative default
    rate after initial rating. As the recovery rate on defaulted bonds is around 50%,
    this annualizes to a mere 0.23% annualized loss rate. Since the spread between
    Baa and Aaa bonds has averaged around 1.2% since 1919, this generates an approximate
    0.97% annualized excess return compared to the riskless Aaa yield, creating the

    然而，Baa债券仍然是“投资级”的，并且在初始评级后只有4.7%的10年累积违约率。 由于违约债券的恢复率约为50%，这使得年度损失率仅为0.23%。 自1919年以来，Baa和Aaa债券之间的利差平均约为1.2%，这产生了与无风险Aaa收益率相比的约0.97%的年化超额回报，从而产生了利差对所承担风险“太高”的难题。
