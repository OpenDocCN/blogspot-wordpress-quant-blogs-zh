- en: It is not surprising that the threat of the dissolution of the Euro has been
    a major market influence these days. But one would expect that such a relationship
    would be coincidental rather than predictive. Over the past 50 days one would
    have made a 10.42% return by simply trading the SPY based on today’s direction
    in the Euro using FXE as a proxy. Thus if the Euro went up today, you would go
    long the SPY, and if it went down today you would go short the SPY. This model
    has had 60% accuracy at predicting the next day SPY return, and has made an average
    return of .19% per day.  Using the same model over a longer period would have
    resulted in significant losses–a -8.4% CAGR since the inception of the FXE. It
    brings up the important of paying attention to inter-market relationships–primarily
    when the underlying factor makes a high degree of logical sense.

  zh: 欧元解体的威胁成为最近市场的主要影响因素并不令人惊讶。但人们可能会认为，这样的关系是巧合而非预测性的。在过去50天里，仅通过基于欧元今天的走势交易SPY，使用FXE作为代理，就可以获得10.42%的回报。因此，如果欧元今天上涨，你就做多SPY，如果下跌，你就做空SPY。这一模型在预测第二天SPY回报方面具有60%的准确率，并且每天的平均回报率为0.19%。在更长的时期内使用同一模型将导致重大损失——自FXE成立以来，年复合年化回报率为-8.4%。这强调了关注跨市场关系的重要性——主要是当基础因素具有高度逻辑意义时。
