- en: Danny Kahneman is the father of behavioral economics, and writes many interesting
    things. I think the implications of this school are vastly overstated, but he's
    a thoughtful, interesting, person.

- en: . His main idea is that there are two kinds of 'happiness', that which is experienced
    in a particular moment, and that which is remembered. The experiencing self that
    lives in the present, and is relevant when a doctor asks ‘does it hurt when I
    do this’? The remembering self is present, as when we ask ‘how was your vacation’?
    Happiness can be the memorizing self over time, or happiness when someone thinks
    about their life.

  zh: 他的主要观点是，存在两种“幸福”，一种是在特定时刻体验的幸福，一种是记忆中的幸福。体验自我存在于当下，并且在医生问“我这样做疼吗”的时候是有关的；而记忆自我是存在的，就像我们问“你的假期怎么样”？幸福可以是随着时间而加深的记忆自我中的快乐，或者是当人们想起他们的生活时的幸福。
- en: He mentions that these two aspects are very different, and lead to different
    objectives. The correlation between people’s experiential vs. remembered happiness
    is 0.5, which is why you can ask someone ‘are you happy now?’ and get no correlation
    with income over $60k, and ‘are you happy with your life?’, and get a significant
    correlation with income over $60k. It’s the difference between being happy in
    your life, and being happy about your life.

  zh: 他提到这两个方面是非常不同的，并引发了不同的目标。人们体验的幸福与记忆的幸福之间的相关性为0.5，这就是为什么你可以问一个人“你现在幸福吗？”并得不到与收入超过60,000美元的相关性，而问“你对你的生活感到幸福吗？”并得到收入超过60,000美元的显著相关性。这就是在你的生活中快乐和对你的生活感到快乐之间的区别。
- en: The difference between the two has been documented by by many experiments. For
    example, during colonoscopies in the 1990’s, back when the procedure was unambiguously
    painful, subjects would record their pain every minute. If you think of the pain
    going over a bell curve over time (rising and falling symmetricall), an experience
    that stopped at the top of the curve would be better than one that road the curve
    over its entire path. Yet the remembered experience that stopped at the top would
    be remembered worse, because the diminution of pain at the lower ending point
    would make the longer experience with more total pain seem ‘better'.

  zh: 这两者之间的区别已经被许多实验所记录。例如，在1990年代的结肠镜检查中，当时该程序显然是痛苦的，受试者会每隔一分钟记录他们的疼痛。如果你认为这种疼痛随时间呈钟形曲线（对称升降），在曲线顶点停止的经历要比沿着整个过程走的经历要好。然而，记忆中在顶点停止的经历会记得更糟，因为在较低的结束点疼痛减轻会使总疼痛更长的经历看起来更“好”。

    generally prefer the memorizing self vs. the experiencing self.

  zh: 人们主要在体验和回忆经历之间选择，通常更喜欢记忆自我而不是经历自我。
- en: You can predictably manipulate the remembered experiences by manipulating endings.
    In the colonoscopy case, just remember to draw the procedure out longer, making
    it slightly less painful every minute, even though the procedure is functionally
    over. Go on a 1 week vacation instead of 2, because you will remember the experience
    it the same, as the memory of going to Greece is basically allocated a unit regardless
    of length once you go over a couple of days. This explains why people generally
    like having children, and find them adding to their life’s satisfaction, yet generally
    don’t like playing or interacting with their children.

  zh: 你可以通过操纵结尾来可预测地操纵记忆经历。在结肠镜检查的案例中，只需记得延长手术时间，每隔一分钟使疼痛减轻，即使手术实质上已经结束。度假一周而非两周，因为你会记得这次经历是一样的，因为一旦超过几天，你去希腊的记忆基本上被分配了一定的时间。这解释了为什么人们通常喜欢生孩子，并认为他们增加了生活满意度，但通常不喜欢和孩子一起玩或互动。

    main points).
