- en: If Blogger’s math is to be believed, this is my millennial post. I had originally
    intended to roll this post out with limited fanfare, but a strange confluence
    of events has caused me to reconsider. First, over the weekend, the blog received
    substantial accolades from Barron’s options columnist [Steven Sears](http://online.barrons.com/public/search/results.html)
    in [For the Markets, How Tweet It Is](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB124545040547032535.html).
    Today, the Wall Street Journal’s [MarketBeat](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/)
    columnist Matt Phillips referred to the “VIX-obsessed blog VIX and More” in his
    [Ugly Start of Week for Stocks as Oil Drops, VIX Jumps](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/06/22/ugly-start-of-week-for-stocks-as-oil-drops-vix-jumps/).

  zh: 如果Blogger的数学可信，这是我的千禧篇帖子。我原本打算低调推出这篇帖子，但一系列奇怪的事件让我重新考虑。首先，在周末，博客收到了《巴伦周刊》专栏作家[史蒂文·塞尔斯](http://online.barrons.com/public/search/results.html)在《For
    the Markets, How Tweet It Is》中的大量赞誉。[华尔街日报]的[MarketBeat](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/)专栏作家麦特·菲利普斯在今天提到了“VIX-痴迷博客VIX和更多”在他的《Ugly
    Start of Week for Stocks as Oil Drops, VIX Jumps》中。

    evolution of the blog and to help point the many new readers to some of the highlights

- en: 'The story begins in December 2006, with the VIX hovering around 10.00\. At
    the time, I was looking for an online location to serve as a searchable repository
    for some of my research on the VIX. After sampling some online message boards
    and determining these were too unwieldy, I decided to try blogging. In the first
    week of January, I determined Blogger was the easiest way to take the plunge.
    The VIX handle had already been claimed by another blogger and I figured I didn’t
    want to box myself into such a narrow subject area anyway, so I settled on the
    “and More” escape hatch and plunged in with [VIX and More: An Introduction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html).
    With the VIX barely out of single digits and left for dead by most, I did not
    expect to see much in the way of traffic, but after a couple of weeks, a few hearty
    souls started dropping in. To highlight the absurdity of devoting a blog entirely
    to the VIX, I added the tagline, “Your one-stop VIX-centric view of the universe…”
    and hoped that the ellipses would be a signal to readers that everything was tongue
    in cheek.'

  zh: 故事开始于2006年12月，当时VIX在10.00附近徘徊。当时，我正在寻找一个在线位置，作为我的VIX研究的一些搜索库。在尝试了一些在线论坛并确定这些论坛过于杂乱之后，我决定尝试写博客。一月份的第一周，我确定Blogger是我入水的最简单方式。VIX的处理权已经被另一位博主占用，我想我也不想把自己限制在如此狭窄的主题领域里，所以我选择了“更多”逃生舱，并推出了[VIX和更多：介绍](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html)。当VIX刚刚走出个位数并且被大多数人遗弃时，我没有期待看到太多的人流量，但在几周后，几个勇敢的人开始光顾。为了强调把一个博客完全献给VIX的荒谬性，我增加了副标题，“您的VIX中心宇宙的一站式视角…”，并希望省略号能成为读者这是玩笑的信号。
- en: For some additional context and to underscore the absurdity of the venture,
    at the time I was trading almost 100% stocks – very few options – and did not
    include the VIX in my stable of indicators. I did, however, have a strong belief
    that most of what we learn comes from getting out of our comfort zones, so I embraced
    this electronic journey as a potential learning opportunity.

- en: Toward the end of February, when some asked what I wanted for my birthday, I
    joked, “A 20% spike in the VIX, of course.” Well I got a [record 64% spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/birthday-party.html)
    for my birthday and quite a few curious souls who showed up wondering what it
    all meant. The joke, it turns out, was on me.

    turns out, 玩笑开在我自己身上。
- en: By the time Bear Stearns collapsed and the sub-prime meltdown had transformed
    into a full-blown financial crisis, I discovered that I was probably the only
    person who had been thinking about and writing about the VIX and volatility almost
    every day for two years. What started out as a lark has become a serious venture,
    quoted in such publications as the *Wall Street Journal*, *Financial Times*, *Barron’s*,
    *Globe and Mail*, etc.
