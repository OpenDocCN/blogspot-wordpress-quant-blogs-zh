    for a few examples. I have recently been playing around with the concept but with
    a very different approach. I figured it might be interesting for readers to hear
    another approach to a similar problem.

- en: 'Rotation systems are often based on two very simple concepts: momentum (relative
    strength) effect and negative correlation. The goal of such models is usually
    to allocate capital to securities trending on the upside. By selecting securities
    that are show negatively correlated behaviour we expect the securities to complement
    each other depending on the regime. For example one could include in the basket
    of available securities stocks and fixed incomes ETFs with the expectation to
    be long bond when stocks are not performing and vice-versa. This kind of model
    basically surfs the beta with the momentum of securities. This approach demands
    certain considerations when creating the model, and depending on the investor,
    various degrees of fancy maths are going to be used. When looking at creating
    such systems, we need to determine the following amongst others:'

- en: The negative correlation amongst assets is a desirable feature here. We possibly
    also could include ETFs with different degrees of leverage to aggressively add
    beta when the time is right. Then we can select them based on heuristic, macroeconomic
    relationship, data mining etc.

  zh: 资产之间的负相关性是这里的一个有吸引力的特征。我们也许还可以包含不同程度杠杆的ETFs，以便在适当的时候积极增加beta。然后，我们可以根据启发式方法、宏观经济关系、数据挖掘等来选择它们。
- en: '**2\. How is momentum measured and ranked?** It could be using a simple normalized
    difference between prices of different time frames or a rate-of-change indicator.
    The RSI , [DVO](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/07/29/the-dvo/) or [TSI](http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/)
    indicators are also good candidates. Alternatively you could fit a least square
    model and evaluate slope and residuals. You could also do some kind of factor
    decomposition and create a factor model to forecast momentum.'

    或 [TSI](http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/) 指标也是不错的选择。或者，您可以拟合一个最小二乘模型，并评估斜率和残差。您还可以进行某种因子分解，创建一个因子模型来预测动量。'

    could be used or we could use volatility to adjust the weight amongst securities.
    Mean-variance optimization with certain tweaks to it would perhaps make a good

- en: '**4\. How often do we recalibrate the strategy?** Most TAA systems recalibrate
    monthly and some rotation systems trade on a weekly time frame. The trick is to
    minimize the transaction cost while still capitalizing on the uptrend of selected
    securities and mitigating the drawdown. The appeal of such systems is usually
    their risk adjusted performance and we would not want to compromise it.'

  zh: '**4. 我们多久重新调整一次策略？** 大多数TAA系统每月重新调整一次，而一些轮动系统则是按周的时间框架进行交易。关键是要在仍能利用选定证券的上行趋势的同时最小化交易成本，并缓解回撤。这类系统的吸引力通常在于它们的风险调整后的表现，我们不希望妥协这一点。'

    at Marketsci recently talked about taking correlation during market shocks into

- en: Without spoiling the next post, I can say that my rotation system will be very
    different from anything discussed so far on the blogosphere (as far as I am aware).
    Instead of using historical relative strength we will see how we can use machine
    learning classification and select securities using the forecast. I will also
    try to incorporate new metrics to help with system performance.

  zh: 在不泄露下篇文章内容的前提下，我可以说明我的轮动系统将与其他博客上讨论的内容（至少我所知道的）非常不同。我们不是使用历史相对强度，而是看看如何使用机器学习分类来选择证券并预测。我还将尝试整合新的指标以帮助提高系统性能。
