- en: ', which examines the many ways that the natural world contributes to our well
    being considered in economic terms. "Many ways" is of course an absolutely absurd
    understatement, as the natural world essentially provides everything that makes
    our lives possible. But if you turn off your brain, swallow hard and actually
    do calculations of environmentally produced economic value -- sadly, it seems
    that only this approach has influence in our world where everything comes down
    to economic costs and benefits -- you find (without any surprise) that the value
    of "ecosystem services" on a yearly basis is many times current global GDP.'

  zh: ，该书籍探讨了自然界以经济术语对我们幸福的许多贡献。 "许多方式"当然是一个绝对荒谬的低估，因为自然界基本上为我们提供了使生活成为可能的一切。但如果你关闭你的大脑，勇敢地吞下计算环境产生的经济价值——不幸的是，似乎只有这种方法才能影响我们这个世界，在这里一切都归结为经济成本和收益——你会发现（毫不惊讶），“生态系统服务”每年的价值是当前全球GDP的好几倍。
- en: Personally, I think it is obvious that this is a vast underestimate, but if
    it is necessary to convince people who cannot think in any other terms, then so
    be it. The Earth's ecosystems produce the oxygen we breath. How much value is
    there in that? I would say it is pretty much infinite, although I'm sure someone
    will argue that we could, with the right hypothetical technology, produce our
    own oxygen and so replace those messy natural resources with industry based on
    our own knowledge, perhaps we'd even boost the economy in the process! Bollocks.
    Juniper's book is a beautifully written corrective to such nonsense.

  zh: 我个人认为这显然是一个巨大的低估，但如果有必要说服那些无法用其他方式思考的人，那么就这样吧。地球生态系统产生了我们呼吸的氧气。这值多少钱？我认为这是几乎无限的，尽管我敢肯定有人会争辩说，凭借正确的假设性技术，我们可以生产自己的氧气，因此用基于我们自己的知识的产业替代那些混乱的自然资源，也许我们还能在这个过程中推动经济！胡说。朱尼珀的书对这种胡言乱语进行了优美的纠正。

  zh: 我们与自然世界在微妙的相互依存中进化；我们并不是凭借理性思维和技术超越自然世界自我创造的，尽管这是现代的幻觉。虽然这来自一个截然不同的背景——拉比·阿里·
    Khan的《幸福食谱》（Canyon Partners的Mitch Julis提供）——我认为以下的话充满了智慧：
- en: 'Modern man, intoxicated with his own success, is prone to hubris. He sees himself
    as a self-made man, and worships his ‘creator’ every time he glances in the mirror...
    Like Narcissus gazing into the water while perched on a rock, modern man no longer
    recalls where he came from, and his own self-absorption mesmerizes him. He is
    isolated, and because he has forgotten the past, he has no humility, no perspective,
    no context. At the same time, he jeopardizes his connection with the future: Only
    when we transmit historical consciousness to our children, and live beyond the
    narrow confines of the present, do we stand a chance of being appreciated by our
    children – rather than being rejected, in turn, as a relic from the past.'

  zh: 现代人因自己的成功而陶醉，容易产生自负。他将自己视为自力更生的人，每次照镜子都会崇拜他的“创造者”...就像站在石头上的纳西索斯凝视着水面，现代人已经不记得自己来自何处，他自己的自我沉溺使他着迷。他是孤立的，因为他忘记了过去，所以他没有谦卑，没有观点，没有背景。与此同时，他危及了自己与未来的联系：只有当我们把历史意识传递给我们的孩子，并超越狭隘的现在，我们才有可能得到孩子们的欣赏——而不是像过去的遗迹一样被孩子们所拒绝。
