- en: The data points closely watched this past weekend were the releases of China's
    Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) readings. On Saturday, China reported that its
    February manufacturing PMI had missed expectations and skidded to 35.7, and services
    PMI also missed and printed at 29.6\. Both readings were all-time lows.

- en: Was these misses surprises? Yes and no. They were surprises inasmuch as the
    market partly expected the authorities to manipulate the numbers and report a
    less severe downturn. They were no surprise as the Chinese economy was obviously
    very weak in the wake of the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic gripping the country.

  zh: 这些失误是意外的吗？是也不是。它们之所以意外，是因为市场部分预期当局会操纵数据，报告一个不那么严重的下滑。它们不意外的地方在于，随着COVID-19冠状病毒疫情席卷全国，中国经济明显非常疲弱。
