- en: Since the financial crisis of 2008, an explosion of research has aimed to understand
    what makes financial markets prone to sporadic crises. The potential sources of
    trouble are many, including debt and leverage, financial concentration and the
    problem of “too big to fail,” as well as perverse incentives for bankers to take
    on large risks. Markets go wrong in any of a thousand ways, and, unfortunately,
    it seems that understanding each one requires intimate familiarity with the fine
    details of the financial architecture, contracts, legal regulations, individual
    incentives and so on.

  zh: 自2008年金融危机以来，大量研究致力于理解是什么使金融市场容易发生突发危机。潜在的问题来源很多，包括债务和杠杆、金融集中以及“太大而不能倒”的问题，还有银行家承担巨大风险的扭曲激励。市场以千种方式出错，不幸的是，看起来要理解每一个问题都需要对金融架构、合同、法律规范、个人激励等细枝末节有深入了解。

    Network scientists know that the topology of a network – the pattern of links
    or relationships that hold it together – can have a decisive influence on its
    properties. In the context of financial networks, [new research](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14416)
    suggests that subtle changes in network topology may be the key to understanding
    a common pathway by which financial markets become unstable. For all the forbidding
    complexity of the modern financial system, they suggest, instability tends to
    follow from the emergence of particular cycles or closed circuits of dependence
    within the network topology, as these tend to amplify disturbances or distress.

  zh: 然而，过分关注细节可能会分散人们对深刻相似之处的注意力。网络科学家知道，一个网络的拓扑结构——保持其在一起的链接或关系的模式——可以对其属性产生决定性的影响。在金融网络的背景下，[新的研究](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14416)表明，网络拓扑的微小变化可能是理解金融市场变得不稳定的共同途径的关键。尽管现代金融系统复杂难懂，但他们认为，不稳定性往往源于网络拓扑中特定周期或封闭依赖环的出现，因为这些往往会放大干扰或
    distress。

  zh: 我将在下面简要解释工作的基本逻辑。这是一篇理论文章，并非针对详细实践政策的食谱。但它确实有助于阐明驱动不稳定的基本机制，并为避免不稳定提供广泛的见解。
- en: First, a little background. Some of the motivation for this work comes from
    the history of thinking in ecology. Back in the 1970s, ecologists widely believed
    that the stability of an ecosystem would generally be enhanced by increasing complexity,
    as reflected in the presence of a large number of interactions between a diverse
    set of species. But the theoretical ecologist Robert May overturned this intuition,
    at least partly, by showing in simplified network models of food webs that complexity
    can in some cases undermine stability. His analysis indicated that networks with
    a larger number of interactions could be less stable, and inspired ecologists
    to begin searching for possible new factors that might account for ecosystem stability
    – for example, the presence of specific topological motifs within food webs.

  zh: 首先，让我们稍微了解一下背景。这项工作的部分动机来自生态学的历史思考。早在1970年代，生态学家普遍认为，生态系统的稳定性通常会通过增加复杂性而得到增强，这体现在多样物种之间存在大量相互作用。但理论生态学家罗伯特·梅（Robert
    May）通过展示简化食物网的网络模型，部分地颠覆了这种直觉，表明在某些情况下复杂性会破坏稳定性。他的分析表明，互动数量较多的网络可能更不稳定，并激励生态学家开始寻找可能解释生态系统稳定性的新因素——例如，食物网中特定的拓扑图案。
- en: Just after the financial crisis, May – who was formerly the Chief Science Advisor
    to the UK Government – joined with the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane [in arguing](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7330/abs/nature09659.html)
    for the relevance of this insight to the stability of financial  systems as well.
    Financial networks have grown enormously more complex in the past 30 years, and,
    as May and Haldane noted, the pre-crisis literature in economics and finance mostly
    viewed this as a good thing. Traditional thinking held that more complexity, achieved
    through a wider spectrum of financial instruments, greater diversification and
    wider spreading of risks, would improve stability. Yet May and Haldane pointed
    to a handful of studies, mostly in the last decade, linking rising complexity
    with increasing instability.

  zh: 就在金融危机之后，玛雅（May）——她之前是英国政府的首席科学顾问——与英格兰银行的安德鲁·霍尔丹（Andrew Haldane）合作[论证](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7330/abs/nature09659.html)了这一见解对于金融系统稳定性的相关性。在过去的30年中，金融网络变得极其复杂，正如玛雅和霍尔丹所指出的，危机前的经济学和金融文献大多认为这是件好事。传统观念认为，通过更复杂的金融工具、更大的多样化以及风险更广泛的分散，会增加稳定性。然而，玛雅和霍尔丹引用了过去十年中的一些研究，这些研究表明，复杂性的增加与不稳定性上升有关。
- en: Six years later, this idea that too much complexity can cause trouble is becoming
    less “radical,” although the story also remains unsatisfyingly complicated. Models
    serving as examples tend to include fairly intricate details of how financial
    institutions interact – particulars of contracts, for example, or mechanisms for
    debt default resolution. Do such details always play a decisive role? Or is there
    a simple and general story about how changes in network topology create instability
    that stands above the details?

  zh: 六年后，过度复杂性可能引起问题的这一想法变得不那么“激进”，尽管这个故事也仍然令人不满意地复杂。作为例子的模型通常包括金融机构如何互动的一些相当复杂的细节——例如合同的具体内容，或者债务违约解决机制。这些细节总是起决定性作用吗？或者存在一个简单且普遍的故事，关于网络拓扑变化如何产生不稳定性，超越了这些细节？
- en: This is the question asked – and answered, in the affirmative – by this paper.
    What Marco Bardoscia and colleagues do is to study a class of models of the Interbank
    network, and probe the stability of the network as they vary two parameters characterizing
    its complexity. These are 1) market integration, reflecting the number of banks
    participating in the financial system, and 2) diversification, referring to the
    proliferation of financial contracts. Importantly, the study doesn't test stability
    in the usual way of running stress tests and estimating the total losses likely
    to amount from some assumed shocks to the system. This approach requires specific
    assumptions on the nature of the financial contracts and mechanisms of distress
    propagation, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.

  zh: 这是本文提出的问题——并且以肯定的方式回答。 Marco Bardoscia及其同事所做的是研究银行间网络的一类模型，并探查随着反映其复杂性的两个参数的变化，网络的稳定性如何变化。这两个参数是1）市场一体化，反映参与金融系统的银行数量，以及2）多样化，指的是金融合同的激增。重要的是，这项研究并没有用通常的方法来进行压力测试和估计系统受到某些假设冲击可能造成的总损失。这种方法需要对金融合同的性质和
    distress 传播机制做出具体的假设，这使得很难得出一般性结论。
- en: Instead, Bardoscia and colleagues study how gradual changes in the interconnection
    pathways in the network can create mechanisms that tend to amplify small disturbances,
    rather than dampening them away. For example, the figure below illustrates how
    the network goes from being stable to unstable just due to gradual diversification,
    normally thought of as beneficial for risk management. It shows a network eigenvalue
    λ[max] reflecting whether the propagation dynamics of the network dampen (λ[max]
    < 1) or amplify (λ[max] > 1) small disturbances. The researchers used the balance
    sheets of the top 50 listed banks in the European Union as a starting point, and
    then simulated a process in which banks gradually increase the degree of diversifi
    cation by creating further exposures towards additional counterparties. They carefully
    rebalanced the network at each stage to keep the assets and liabilities consistent
    with the original balance sheets and the interbank leverages of all banks fixed.
    As the degree of diversi fication increases, a bank's exposures spread out across
    ever more counterparties. Even though the total interbank exposure of each bank
    remains constant, the banking system eventually goes unstable, and it doesn't
    even take a lot of diversification to make it happen. As the figure shows, instability
    first arises when contracts link together just 3% of all the possible pairs that
    could in principle be linked.

  zh: 相反，Bardoscia及其同事研究了网络中相互连接路径的逐渐变化如何创造机制，这些机制倾向于放大小的干扰，而不是将它们消除。例如，下面的图表说明了网络如何仅仅由于逐渐的多样化而从稳定变为不稳定，这通常被认为是风险管理的有益之处。它显示了网络特征值λ[max]，反映网络传播动力学是
    dampen（λ[max] < 1）还是 amplify（λ[max] > 1）小的干扰。研究人员以欧洲联盟前50家上市银行的资产负债表作为起点，然后模拟了一个过程，在这个过程中银行通过创建进一步的暴露给额外的对手方逐渐增加多样化程度。他们仔细地在每个阶段重新平衡网络，以保持资产和负债与原始资产负债表一致，并使所有银行的银行间杠杆固定。随着多样化的程度增加，银行的风险敞口扩散到越来越多的对手方。尽管每家银行的总体对手方暴露保持不变，但银行系统最终变得不稳定，而且使其发生并不需要大量的多样化。如图所示，不稳定性首先在合同仅连接起所有可能对中3%的时候出现。

  zh: 这个例子说明了随着复杂性通过多样化增加而从稳定到不稳定的转变。论文同样证实，如果复杂性仅仅通过银行数量的增加而上升，也会发生类似的转变。
- en: 'The conclusion is that more complex and highly networked markets should generically
    tend toward instability. A financial system can go unstable as the number of banks
    increases, or as the number of contracts among banks increases, even if the individual
    leverage of banks does not increase. In either case, instability appears as a
    holistic, network effect, even though each bank individually has an unchanging
    risk profi le. The implication: financial policies that seem wise from the point
    of view of the risks to individual banks can actually – and counter-intuitively
    – increase fi nancial instability to the whole system.'

  zh: 结论是，更加复杂且高度网络化的市场通常应该倾向于不稳定。一个金融系统可能随着银行数量的增加或银行间合同数量的增加而不稳定，即使银行的个体杠杆没有增加。在这两种情况下，不稳定呈现为整体性的网络效应，尽管每个银行单独具有不变的风险轮廓。含义是：从单个银行风险的角度看似乎明智的金融政策实际上——且反直觉地——可能增加整个系统的金融不稳定。
- en: The paper also goes into some detail on the origin of such instability, which
    lies in the fact that in both processes banks get increasingly involved in multiple
    cycles (i.e. closed chains) of contracts. This is an interesting technical detail
    that I won't get into, although such factors might well prove useful as targets
    for monitoring by authorities. In any event, it's clear that systemic risk cannot
    be reduced through measures long thought to reduce risks in standard economics.
    Banking proliferation and diversification, if excessive, can create worse problems
    than they solve.

  zh: 该论文还详细探讨了这种不稳定的根源，在于两个过程中银行不断卷入多个周期（即闭合链）的合同中。这是一个有趣的技术细节，我不会深入讨论，尽管这些因素可能很好地证明作为监管机构监控的目标是有用的。无论如何，很清楚，系统风险不能通过长期以来被认为可以减少标准经济学风险的措施来降低。如果银行过度扩张和多样化，可能会造成比解决的问题更糟糕的后果。
