- en: In the comments section in yesterday’s [The Spread Between the VIX and 20 Day
    Historical Volatility in the SPX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/spread-between-vix-and-20-day.html),
    über reader Frank shared his analysis of the VIX relative to the 20 day [historical
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) of the SPX. Frank’s conclusion is that when the spread between the VIX and
    the SPX's 20-day HV is one standard deviation or more below the average from the
    previous year, the SPX is much more likely to close down in the next five days
    than when the spread is one standard deviation or more above the previous year’s
    average.

  zh: 在昨天的评论区里的 [VIX和SPX 20日历史波动率差异](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/spread-between-vix-and-20-day.html)一词中，极好的读者Frank分享了他对VIX相对于SPX
    20天[历史波动率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)（HV）的分析。弗兰克的结论是，当VIX与SPX的20日HV之间的差距低于前一年的平均值一个标准差或更多时，SPX更有可能在接下来的五天内收盘下跌，而当差距高于前一年的平均值一个标准差或更多时，情况就相反了。
- en: I have examined a number of data sets involving the VIX and various HV calculations
    for the SPX, including 20 day HV. My findings support the idea that when the difference
    between the VIX and the 20 day HV is at historically high levels, the SPX is much
    more likely to outperform over the course of the next couple of weeks. Similarly,
    when the spread is at historically low levels, the SPX is more likely to underperform
    going forward. For reasons likely related to VIX [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion),
    a high spread is a more robust signal than a low spread.

  zh: 我已经检验了一些涉及VIX和SPX各种HV计算的数据集，包括20日HV。我的发现支持这样一种观点，即当VIX和20天HV之间的差异达到历史高位时，SPX更有可能在接下来的几周内表现更出色。同样，当差异处于历史低位时，SPX更有可能在未来表现不佳。由于很可能与VIX[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)相关，较大的差异比较小的差异更具有鲁棒的信号。
- en: Since the spread demonstrates a tendency to trend, I have applied some smoothing
    factors to the spread and compared the spread to its various moving averages.
    In so doing, I have determined that the absolute level of the spread is less important
    than the differential between the spread and its moving averages. Finally, and
    getting back to Frank’s original point, I was surprised to discover that extremes
    in the difference between the spread and the moving averages (both at the high
    end and low end) offer very little information about the future direction of the
    SPX.

  zh: 由于差距呈现出趋势的趋势，我对差距应用了一些平滑因子，并将其与各种移动平均值进行了比较。在这样做的过程中，我发现差距的绝对水平并不像差距与其移动平均值之间的差异那样重要。最后，回到Frank的原始观点，我惊讶地发现差距和移动平均值之间的差异（无论是高端还是低端）在提供有关SPX未来走向的信息方面几乎没有什么作用。
