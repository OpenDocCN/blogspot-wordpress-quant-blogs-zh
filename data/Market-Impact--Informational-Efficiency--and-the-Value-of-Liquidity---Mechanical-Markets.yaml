    of obvious when you only consider first order effects; if a short term trader
    buys low and sells high, then the money they made has to come from their counterparties
    somehow. By this logic, if one type of trader consistently makes money, then they
    are doing so directly at the expense of the rest of the market. This view makes

- en: 'Well-developed markets with widespread participation offer traders liquidity
    and the expectation of continued liquidity. That liquidity is worth something.
    For long-term traders, a liquid marketplace makes it easy to find a partner to
    trade with. Imagine, for example, how much you would save when selling your home
    if you didn’t need a broker to find buyers. Liquidity also raises the value of
    assets themselves; in essence, something is worth more to you if you know that
    you can readily sell it later. How much more though? If a prospective buyer knew
    a home could be later sold without paying a 3% broker fee, then maybe they’d consider
    bidding 1% higher for it. In financial markets, the classic example of this phenomenon
    is the premium that on-the-run treasuries command in comparison to those that
    are off-the-run: A 30-year bond with only 10 years left until maturity generally
    trades at a lower price than a freshly issued 10-year bond, even though the two
    bonds should make payments that are effectively identical. The reason suspected
    for this discount is that the fresh 10-year is more actively traded and easier
    to sell if desired.'

  zh: 参与广泛的市场提供给交易者流动性和持续流动性的期望。这种流动性是有价值的。对于长期交易者，一个流动的市场使之更容易找到交易伙伴。例如，想象一下如果卖房时不需要中介来找买家会节省多少钱。流动性还提高了资产本身的价值；实际上，如果你知道自己稍后可以轻松卖出，那么某个东西对你来说就更有价值。但是价值提高了多少？如果潜在的买家知道一栋房子稍后可以卖出而不需要支付3%的中介费，那么也许他们会考虑出更高的价。在金融市场中，这种现象的典型例子就是现贴国债相对于过贴国债的溢价：尽管两种债券所做的支付实际上是相同的，但剩余10年到期的30年期债券通常的价格要低于新发行的10年期债券，即使这两个债券应该是等价的。有人怀疑这种折价的原因是新的10年期债券交易量更大，而且如果需要的话更容易卖出。

  zh: 流动性提供了期权价值
- en: One way to think of liquidity’s worth is to consider an analogy with put options.
    A put option offers its owner the ability to sell an asset in the future at a
    pre-determined price. Liquidity offers the owner of an asset the ability to sell
    in the future at the prevailing market price, whatever that may be. That difference
    is important – but even though the “option” associated with liquidity has an “exercise
    price” that floats with the market price, it is still worth something. Consider
    that investors pay their brokers for guaranteed executions at (or worse than)
    the market price. Or consider the existence of [trade-at-settlement](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Trade+at+Settlement+-+TAS)
    products, where one party will pay another in order to guarantee an execution
    at the day’s settlement price (a measure of market price). A liquid security thus
    has an embedded put option that should increase its value. [[1](#bottom1impact)]
    Options, of course, increase in value when volatility rises. The price of liquidity
    appears to do the same, for instance on p.42 of [this paper](http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2006/200628/200628pap.pdf),
    you can see that the on-the-run premium tends to be higher during times of high
    volatility. [[2](#bottom2impact)] [[3](#bottom3impact)] [[4](#bottom4impact)]

  zh: 思考流动性的价值的一种方式是考虑与看跌期权类比的。看跌期权赋予其所有者在未来以预设价格卖出资产的能力。流动性赋予资产所有者在未来以现行市场价格卖出的能力，无论那可能是什么。这个差异很重要——但尽管与流动性相关的“期权”的“行使价格”会随市场价格波动，但它仍然有价值。考虑投资者为他们经纪人支付的保证执行价（或更糟的是）市场价格。或者考虑[交易结算](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Trade+at+Settlement+-+TAS)产品的存在，其中一方会支付另一方以确保按当天的结算价格执行（市场价格的一个指标）。因此，流动性良好的证券具有内嵌的看跌期权，这应该会增加其价值。
    [[1](#bottom1impact)] 期权当然是在波动性上升时增加价值。流动性的价格似乎也是一样，例如在[这篇论文](http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2006/200628/200628pap.pdf)的第42页，你可以看到在波动性高时，在运行溢价通常较高。

- en: 'The cost of liquidity is generally divided into 2 components: the bid-ask spread
    and market impact. The spread is a measure of how much market-makers need to be
    compensated for the risk of trading with a counterparty large enough to move the
    price. Market impact is the change in price that occurs after a trade. Since large
    traders often split their transactions into many small child orders, market impact
    means that the latter part of these orders are executed at a less favorable price.
    Very roughly speaking, small traders are expected to have the bid-ask spread as
    their primary transaction cost and large traders are expected to have market impact
    as theirs. One common view is that these large traders are “informed” and their
    favorable information is why market-makers lose money when trading with them.

    [[8](#bottom8impact)] 这些预期价格变动中的一部分在实际指数变动确定后（大型基金已完成它们的再平衡）会恢复原值——这意味着至少这部分费用并不是交换了有价值的东西，比如指数成分股所享受的额外流动性。这种效应与一些评论员所担心的[“无形头皮”](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-12/stock-market-s-invisible-scalp-truly-is-invisible-in-index-funds)不同。那种“头皮”关心的是基金与其指数基准的偏差，而我们这里讨论的是实际指数的业绩不佳。Antti

    requiring compensation for the risk of being run over by large, informed traders.
    If that model were complete, an informational change would be the only reason
    a price should ever move. This view is a vestige of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
    (EMH). In reality, prices move in response to changes in supply and demand, even
    if those changes aren’t related to any new information. Consider a really simple
    model, where traders each have their own point estimate for the “intrinsic value”
    of a stock. Unless everybody has the same estimate, when somebody buys more stock
    than traders with the lowest estimate are willing to sell, the market price will
    rise. This is another way to think of an order book. [[10](#bottom10impact)] The

    move prices is like saying that there are trillions of dollars of undeployed capital

- en: Because market impact is such an important force in our markets, detecting institutional
    order flow could be very lucrative. Market makers moving their quotes out of the
    way of suspected order flow is order anticipation. Trading in the direction of
    suspected order flow is also order anticipation, though some label it “front-running”.
    In public discourse lately, there’s been some tendency to claim that order anticipation
    is fundamentally the domain of HFT. This is clearly wrong. The connection between
    stock index changes and anticipatory price moves has a time scale of days, and
    has been a measurable effect for decades. Similarly, there was [suspicion](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-23/predatory-traders-front-ran-bill-ackman-s-botox-buy)
    recently that Pershing Square’s toehold purchase of Allergan shares suffered from
    order anticipation. Again, these price moves occurred over the scale of days,
    and as can be seen in an [analysis](http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/090918.pdf)
    by Betton, Eckbo, and Throburn, there is nothing new about toehold purchases exhibiting
    large price impact. [[11](#bottom11impact)] It’s hard to know how much of this
    impact is due to anticipatory trading or just supply and demand. Separating these
    two effects is particularly difficult because herding among traders is common
    and arguably a form of order anticipation itself. Traders’ tendency to make similar
    decisions simultaneously (herding) has an important influence on market impact,
    as discussed (among other things) in a [wonderful empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2152)
    by  Zarinelli, Treccani, Farmer, and Lillo. It’s also hard to dismiss order anticipation
    as unhealthy for markets. If liquidity providers were not able to price the risk
    of their counterparty being part of a takeover attempt, trading could become extremely

  zh: 如果，如我们建议的那样，加密和解密的过程是社会浪费性的——比零和游戏还要糟糕——那么，公司之间为了成为最好的解密者而进行的竞争也是社会浪费性的。事实上，高频交易者可能有动机向市场添加噪音，以损害竞争对手，使他们的解密任务变得更加困难。认识到这是一个零和游戏，人们会寻找那些损害竞争对手并提高他们成本的策略。但当然，他们也在做同样的事情。
- en: I have some sympathy with what he’s saying here, but perhaps his analogy of
    encryption offers some additional insight. Loosely speaking, encryption is cheap
    and decryption is very challenging. If there’s sufficient background noise in
    which to camouflage an “encryptor’s” signal, then probably there isn’t much a
    “decryptor” can do to find that signal. Obviously, we can conceive of legal or
    market structures that would tilt the balance of power completely towards the
    “decryption” camp – like if the law required traders to announce their intentions
    before taking action. But, for common market structures, I suspect that it isn’t
    too hard to be almost “maximally” encrypted, that is, to have one’s orders disguised
    to the point where investing more in encryption isn’t going to measurably affect
    their detectability. I’m not claiming that everybody is this careful; there are
    plenty of examples of [sloppy trading](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/market-data-patterns-order-anticipation-and-an-example-trading-strategy/).
    But my intuition is that currently the majority of market impact comes from price
    inelasticity, not order anticipation. That said, I think it’s worthwhile to consider
    whether there are palatable market structures that allow orders to be better concealed.

  zh: 我对他说的话有些同情，但也许他对加密的类比提供了一些额外的洞察。粗略地说，加密是便宜的，而解密是非常具有挑战性的。如果在足够背景噪音中可以掩盖“加密者”的信号，那么“解密者”可能找不到那个信号。显然，我们可以设想一些合法或市场结构，使权力平衡完全倾向于“解密”阵营——比如如果法律规定交易者在采取行动前必须宣布他们的意图。但对于常见的市场结构，我怀疑几乎完全“最大化”加密并不太困难，也就是说，让自己的订单伪装到投资更多加密也不会明显影响其可检测性的程度。我不是说每个人都很小心；有很多[草率交易](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/market-data-patterns-order-anticipation-and-an-example-trading-strategy/)的例子。但我的直觉是目前市场影响主要来自价格弹性，而不是订单预期。话说回来，我认为考虑是否存在让订单更好地隐藏的受欢迎市场结构是有价值的。

    is high. Those increased profits could be partly due to the higher value of liquidity

    they make money via shorting liquidity: by holding assets (particularly fixed
    income) to maturity and riding out fluctuations in market value, they are rewarded
    with a small profit. And one argument against strict mark-to-market accounting
    is that it doesn’t properly encapsulate this aspect of banking. Another perspective
    is that when banks have shorted “too much” liquidity and the price of that liquidity
    has risen (i.e. volatility has gone up and the “option-value” component of liquidity
    is expensive), they tend to rely on governments and central banks to sell them
    additional liquidity cheaply in order to survive. If you consider this government
    backstop to be an unfair subsidy, then asking banks to mark their balance sheets

- en: '[[12](#12impact)] Of course the price of a security can jump discontinuously
    in response to new information, on little to no volume. But security prices move
    continuously during the day, and presumably these price changes have informational
    value. And, when prices change discontinuously at the open, very often they do
    so in an auction with heavy volume. I’d imagine that, whenever a price change
    is accompanied by substantial trading, market impact plays an important role in
    price discovery. This could explain price volatility appearing [lower across the

  zh: 当然，一个证券的价格可能会在几乎没有交易量的情况下突然而跳。但是，在白天，证券价格是连续变动的，并且可以假设这些价格变动具有信息价值。而且，当价格在开盘时突然而变，它们通常伴随着大量成交量的拍卖。我想，无论何时价格变动伴随着大量的交易，市场影响在价格发现中起着重要的作用。这可以解释为什么价格波动在周末比交易时段显得[更低](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/finance/1986-3.pdf)。

- en: Potentially, what these alleged manipulators did was increase their own position
    when they suspected that their counterparty bank would hedge in a low-impact fashion.
    When that was the case, the alleged manipulators could do their high-impact trading
    while their counterparty, on the opposite side, would do low-impact trading. When
    they suspected a rival bank would trade in a high-impact fashion, they might do
    the opposite. I’m not saying they were successful at this, but our markets may
    well allow a high-impact entrance and a low-impact exit, in contradiction with
    a sort of efficiency. Jim Gatheral calls this type of market efficiency, which
    renders manipulation impossible, a “[no-dynamic-arbitrage principle](https://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/2008-6.pdf).”
