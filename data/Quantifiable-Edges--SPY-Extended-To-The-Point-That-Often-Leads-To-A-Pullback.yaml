- en: SPY has now gone 12 days without closing below its 5ma. The study below is one
    I’ve shown a few times over the years.  It looks at other instances in which SPY
    has traded above the 5ma for at least 2 weeks and is now closing at a 10-day high.
    All results are updated.

  zh: SPY 目前已连续 12 天收盘价未低于其 5 日均线。下面的研究是我过去几年展示过几次的内容。它查看了其他 SPY 至少交易于 5 日均线之上两周以上，现在收盘价为
    10 日高的情况。所有结果都已更新。
- en: In the past this setup has commonly been followed by a short-term pullback.
    The downside edge doesn't last long, though. It seems to pretty much play itself
    out over the first 2 days.  It is not an overwhelming edge, but it is still worth
    noting that SPY has been short-term extended for a while and the normal course
    of action at this point is a little pullback.

  zh: 在过去，这种设置通常被短线回调所跟随。尽管看跌的边缘并不持久，但它似乎基本在前两天内自我实现。这不是一个压倒性的优势，但值得注意的是，SPY 已经有一段时间的短线扩展，此刻的正常行为是稍有回调。
