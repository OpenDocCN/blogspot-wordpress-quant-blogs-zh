- en: Today the major market indices have been fluctuating on both sides of Friday’s
    close, occasionally flirting with a short-covering rally only to make a hasty
    retreat and begin what looks like the beginnings of another bull whipping.

  zh: 今天主要市场指数在周五收盘价附近波动，偶尔试探性地买入反弹，但随后匆忙撤退，看起来像是另一轮牛市鞭打的开端。
- en: Last Thursday I stuck my neck out and said, “[with the SPX at 687 as I type
    this, we are very close to an intermediate-term bottom.](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)”
    Frankly, I envisioned a more impressive bounce than the current situation, which
    still has the SPX treading water at 687\. A question that is worth pondering,
    however, is what type of [bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/market%20bottoms)
    is most likely to stick. Sure, a 300 point jump in the DJIA is likely to attract
    some additional money on the long side, but it is also likely to further embolden
    many of the shorts. In the current market environment, I would call that type
    of V-shaped bottom an “easy bottom” and suggest that the shorts are not likely
    to let the current bear buffet end with one sharp move. The easy bottom is more
    likely to be yet another bull trap.

  zh: 上周四我冒险预测说，随着我打下这些字时SPX达到687点，我们非常接近一个中期底部。](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)
    坦白说，我预想的反弹会比目前的情况更令人印象深刻，而SPX仍然在687点附近徘徊。然而，值得深思的一个问题是，哪种底部最有可能站稳。当然，道琼斯工业平均指数的300点涨幅可能会吸引一些更多的多方资金，但这也可能会进一步鼓舞许多空头。在当前市场环境下，我会称这种V型底部为“轻松底部”，并建议空头不太可能让当前的空头袭击以一次急剧的移动结束。轻松底部更有可能是另一个多头陷阱。
- en: Compare an easy bottom with a hard-fought one. Instead of the 300 point jump
    that brings the markets more than a white knuckle distance away from the edge
    of a cliff, imagine a market in which every point becomes a matter of trench warfare,
    with some territory changing hands dozens of times between bulls and bears before
    bulls can finally lay claim to infinitesimal victories. These will be largely
    moral victories at first, but over the course of time as a war of attrition develops,
    many small gains will eventually add up to momentum. Said another way, I do not
    believe the bears will throw in the towel all at once, but will slowly lose interest
    as the pickings become slimmer.

  zh: 比较一下轻松筑底和艰苦斗争后的筑底。不是那种让市场距离悬崖边缘更远、让人心惊胆战的300点涨幅，而是想象一个市场，其中每一个点都成为了一场阵地战，多头和空头在这些点上反复易手，直到多头最终能够宣称取得了微不足道的胜利。这些胜利在起初大多是道义上的胜利，但随着消耗战的进行，许多小胜利最终会累积成动力。换句话说，我不相信空头会一次性认输，但随着战利品的减少，他们会逐渐失去兴趣。
- en: So…as much as an SPX back over 700 might seem to give that devilish 666 bottom
    the best chance of holding, I believe that the hard bottom is more likely to hold
    than the easy bottom.

  zh: 所以……尽管SPX指数重回700点上方可能会让那个恶魔般的666点底部看起来更有可能稳住，但我相信艰难筑底的概率要大于轻松筑底。
