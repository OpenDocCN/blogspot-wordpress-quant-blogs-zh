- en: went through a presentation to a full set of finance faculty, and at the end,
    asked if there were any questions. There were none. I thought, boy, this guy bombed.
    How wrong I was. He was the top guy on the market that year, having solved a complicated
    problem involving comparing individuals with different utility functions. Previously
    it was thought you could only explain the heterogeneity by having different coefficients
    in their functional form, but this guy compared a consumer/investor with a square
    root utility, to that of a consumer with logarithmic utility. I failed to see
    the significance, but then I realized that professors love this kind of thing.
    It was difficult math, and he derived a closed form solution!

  zh: 在一个全体金融教职员工的演讲中，结束时问是否有任何问题。没有。我以为，哎呀，这家伙失败了。我错了。他是当年市场上的佼佼者，解决了一个涉及比较具有不同效用函数的个体的复杂问题。之前人们认为只有通过在功能形式中使用不同的系数才能解释异质性，但这家伙将一个具有平方根效用的消费者/投资者与具有对数效用的消费者进行了比较。我未能看到其重要性，但后来我意识到教授们喜欢这种事情。这是困难的数学问题，他推导出了一个封闭形式的解！

    of articles that show 'a rich class of models', as if interesting applications
