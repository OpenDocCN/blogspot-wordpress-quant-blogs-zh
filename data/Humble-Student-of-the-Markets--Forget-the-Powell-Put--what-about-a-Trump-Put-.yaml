- en: I have been engaged in a running debate about the possibility of a Trump Put
    in the market. My friend believes that Trump is likely to pull back from a full-scale
    trade war with China, as it would tank the stock market and increase the likelihood
    of a recession. The Republicans lost the House in 2018 with the unemployment rate
    at 3.7%. A recession in 2019 or 2020 will not only lose them the White House,
    but probably both houses of Congress. Trump wants to avoid that scenario at all
    costs.

  zh: 我一直在就市场是否可能存在“特朗普保险”进行辩论。我的朋友认为特朗普很可能不会与中国展开全面贸易战，因为这将导致股市暴跌并增加经济衰退的可能性。2018年，在失业率为3.7%的情况下，共和党失去了众议院。2019年或2020年的衰退不仅会让他们失去白宫，还可能失去国会两院。特朗普想尽一切办法避免这种情况。

    he remained convinced that the volatility wasn’t his own doing, but rather, the
