    focused on life, liberty, and property, a free economy with minimal government
    interference (zero government is a straw man caricature). To the extent that people
    are poor, unconditional charity makes them worse, as poverty is primarily the
    outcome of a lack of purpose and discipline rather than food and shelter. Thus,
    workhouses for the poor had codes of conduct and required hard work. Regardless
    of circumstances, the poor can achieve better lives. The formula is neither complex
    nor mysterious. The key choices are to work steadily and stay on the right side
    of the law. For example, if one follows 3 simple rules—finish high school, get
    a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children—only 2
    percent of such people are in poverty today.

    如今还处于贫困之中。

    Second was the death of God, as intellectuals believed organized religion was
    simply a relic of the past, like our belief in the divine right of Kings. No longer
    was it sufficient to merely be right with God, but rather, to do good on earth
    by minimizing suffering. This new progressive ideology was based on the idea that

    taxicab drivers and their customers. Thus, auto and steel union were very strong
    in the 1950s, and those 1950s members did quite well, but the cost was fewer such
    jobs in the future decades; teachers do not have to worry about losing their jobs
    for poor performance, but then education is the one area of the economy where
    real costs of educating students keeps going up, while the real cost of making
    most things (corn, cars, computers) tends to fall. Some think everyone should
    be able to work in a field that has monopoly benefits like tenure, so people do
    not have to deal with the anxiety and costs that come with losing a job. Yet,
    the collective costs of this would be to eliminate productivity growth, as then
