- en: While working out on the elliptical the other day, I was thinking about my musical
    career and my former bandmates. I never became a professional musician, but I
    have certainly had some mild touches with great players who went on to become
    pro musicians.

  zh: 前几天我在椭圆机上锻炼时，想起了我的音乐生涯和前乐队成员。虽然我没有成为一名职业音乐家，但我确实与一些成为职业音乐家的伟大音乐家有过一些轻微的接触。
- en: I first learned to play the drum set as a sophomore in high school. My very
    first band was based in a town called Forest Hills Gardens in Queens, New York.
    We were best friends with another band, and all of us used to jam with each other.
    The lead guitarist of the other band was guy by the name of Chieli Minucci (http://www.chielimusic.com/).
    Chieli went on to be a world-known guitarist in the smooth jazz circles as the
    leader of a band called SFX.

  zh: 我最初是在高中二年级时学会打鼓的。我的第一支乐队在纽约皇后区的一个名叫Forest Hills Gardens的小镇。我们与另一支乐队是好朋友，我们经常一起即兴演奏。另一支乐队的吉他手是一个名叫奇埃利·米努奇（http://www.chielimusic.com/）的人。奇埃利后来成为了
    smooth jazz 圈内知名吉他手，作为乐队SFX的领导者。
- en: As a junior, I played with a progressive rock group from Long Island called
    Heresy. We played some pretty sophisticated covers of songs by ELP (we played
    the entire Karn Evil 9 suite), King Crimson, Gentle Giant, and Jethro Tull (the
    entire Thick as a Brick). The bassist, Tony Garone (http://www.garone.net/tony)
    has gone on to play with Jethro Tull at some of the Tull conventions.

  zh: 作为一名大三学生，我与来自长岛的进步摇滚乐队Heresy合作过。我们演奏了一些相当复杂的歌曲 covers，包括ELP（我们演奏了整个Karn Evil
    9套房）、King Crimson、Gentle Giant和Jethro Tull（整个Thick as a Brick）。贝斯手托尼·加罗内（http://www.garone.net/tony）后来在一些Tull会议上与Jethro
    Tull一起演出。
- en: As a senior in high school, I played with an experimental free-jazz-rock-space
    band called Third Sun. Although the sax/flute/synth play, Douglass Walker, went
    on to become one of the early pioneers of the American Space Rock scene, the player
    who had the most success was Pablo “Coca” Calagero (http://www.myspace.com/pablocalogero).
    He went on to play sax with people like Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, and other
    famous people in the Latin Jazz scene. He also had a part in the movie The Mambo
    Kings.

  zh: 高中最后一年，我与一个名为Third Sun的实验自由爵士摇滚太空乐队合作过。尽管萨克斯/长笛/合成器演奏者道格拉斯·沃克成为了美国太空摇滚场景的早期先驱，但最成功的球员是巴勃罗“可乐”·卡拉戈罗（http://www.myspace.com/pablocalogero）。他后来为蒂托·普恩特、埃迪·帕尔米里等拉丁爵士场景中的著名人物演奏萨克斯，并在电影《曼波王》中扮演角色。
- en: When I went to college, within the first few weeks, I hooked up with a free
    jazz group. The trumpet player was Richard Edson. He went on to fame as the first
    drummer of the noise group Sonic Youth. Richard went on to be an actor, and had
    significant roles in movies like Good Morning Vietnam and Do the Right Thing.
    Most recently, he has been on a series of commercials for the Travelers Insurance
    Company as the human embodiment of risk.

  zh: 当我上大学的时候，在最初的几周内，我与一个自由爵士乐队合作过。小号手是理查德·埃德森。他成为了噪音团体Sonic Youth的第一位鼓手而成名。理查德后来成为一名演员，在电影《早安越南》和《做正确的事》中扮演了重要角色。最近，他在旅行者保险公司的一系列广告中扮演了风险的化身。
- en: After my sophomore year of college, I pretty much gave up on playing with small
    groups. I dove into the world of classical music, and from then on, the only groups
    I cared to play with were orchestras and wind ensembles, in addition to playing
    solo percussion and marimba. But, by association, I have had my five minutes of
    fame.

  zh: 大学二年级结束后，我就基本上放弃与小型乐队演出。我投身于古典音乐的世界，从那时起，我关心的唯一演出团体就是乐团和管乐团，此外还演奏独奏打击乐器和马林巴琴。但是，间接地，我也曾有过五分钟的名气。
