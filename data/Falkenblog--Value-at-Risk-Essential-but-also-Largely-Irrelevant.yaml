    space to find their optimal place on the efficient frontier. VaR risk is mainly
    incidental, and useful for minimizing operational risk (eg, many fatal risks would

- en: To the extent you think this is going on you really have no idea that you have
    no idea how this information is related to strategic and tactical decisions. VaR
    is pretty irrelevant for banks. Sure, it's an essential way to aggregate market
    maker risk, but that risk has been pretty insignificant in the current crisis,
    because to the extent assets or businesses subject to VaR had significant losses,
    the VaR was calculated predicated on the assumptions that drove the business decision
    (ie, that collateral value of equity asset backed securities would not decline).
    This assumption, which is not very technical, made the resulting VaR innocuous,
    and is something anyone understands. Why did people assume this? That's an interesting
    question, but I think it has very little to do with Value-at-Risk. That is, an
    arbitrary but large stress test would have embodied the same assumption circa
    2006.

  zh: 在你认为这种情况正在发生的范围内，你真的不知道你不知道这些信息如何与战略和战术决策相关。VaR 对银行来说是相当无关紧要的。当然，这是一种集合市场风险的基本方式，但在当前危机中，这种风险是相当微不足道的，因为只要资产或企业受到VaR的影响，VaR就是基于推动业务决策的假设计算的（即证券化的资产净值不会下降）。这一假设（并不是很技术性的一个），使得所产生的VaR无害，这是每个人都能理解的。人们为什么会做出这样的假设？这是一个有趣的问题，但我认为这与风险价值-at-Risk关系不大。也就是说，到2006年前后，任意的但较大的压力测试将具有相同的假设。
- en: If you look at Rebenatto's RBS, in their annual report they show a mere 40 million
    pounds of daily 95% VaR, which annualizes to about a 1.3B pounds at a 99.9% VaR.
    Say we multiply that by 3, to get capital needed, we are up to 4 B pounds. RBS
    has about 73B in equity capital. Clearly even in his own company, VaR is not the
    primary driver for understanding their 'risk'.

- en: The idea that Value-at-Risk, or risk numbers at the 5th decimal place, are dangerous,
    presupposes people are using this information in a significant way. That is, supposedly,
    when the VaR of the currency market moves from 43.32491 to 43.32492, traders adjust
    their spreads. Let us give Ricardo the benefit of the doubt, that the "5th decimal"
    statement was rhetorical flourish. In any case he thinks VaR drives real decisions.
    In his circle of contacts (GARP, risk management conferences, presentation of
    VaR to regulators), this arguement may be tenable, but highlights he does not
    understand how strategic decisions are made within a bank. He is being patronized
    by senior management, who absolutely love risk managers who think the fifth decimal
    of their VaR is important, because they don't see the bigger picture and are then
    free to do whatever they want.

  zh: 关于风险价值-at-Risk，或者说小数点后第五位的风险数字是危险的这个想法，假设人们正在重要的方式下使用这些信息。也就是说，当货币市场的VaR从43.32491变为43.32492时，交易员会调整他们的点差。我们假设里卡多恰好看到了这一点，认为“小数点后第五位”的说法是修辞手法。无论如何，他认为VaR推动了真正的决策。在他的人际关系圈（全球风险专业人士协会，风险管理大会，向监管机构展示VaR），这种论点也许是站得住脚的，但却突显了他不理解银行内部如何制定战略决策。他被高层管理层放纵，他们非常喜欢认为VaR的第五位小数是重要的风险管理者，因为他们没有看到更大的图景，便可以自行其事。
- en: VaR is primarly applied to market making activities, and generally these have
    very high Sharpe ratios (>3) because you make you money off bid-ask spread and
    front-running customers, so profit is primarly a function of volume. Any residual
    holdings generate 'market risk' via your VaR, but most market makers don't care
    too much because on a VaR basis, they are all hitting massive home runs in that
    Sharpes are always greater than anyone's hurdle rate. Market making profits are
    a function of volume, which means sales, contacts, not having better VaR measures.
    If they could choose to double their market making activity, and thereby double
    their VaR, all would choose to do so. VaR is a good way to make sure traders aren't
    changing their business model, but it does not capture anything essential to that
    business model, because all market makers want more volume; VaR is not like a
    choice variable in risk-return space.

  zh: VaR主要应用于市场交易活动，通常这些活动的夏普比率很高（>3），因为你可以通过买卖价差和在顾客前进行交易来赚钱，因此利润主要是与成交量挂钩。任何剩余的持有通过你的VaR产生“市场风险”，但大多数市场交易员并不太在意，因为从VaR的角度来看，他们都是打出了巨大的全垒打，因为夏普比率总是高于任何人的提款利率。市场交易的利润是与成交量挂钩的，这意味着销售、联系，而不是拥有更好的VaR测量。如果他们可以选择将其市场交易活动扩大一倍，从而使其VaR翻倍，所有的市场交易员都会选择这样做。VaR是一个很好的方法，可以确保交易员不改变他们的经营模式，但它并没有捕捉到商业模式的任何关键因素，因为所有的市场交易员都希望有更多的交易量；VaR并不像风险回报空间中的一个选择变量。
