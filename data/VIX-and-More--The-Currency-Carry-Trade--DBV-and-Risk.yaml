- en: Anyone who has been active in the financial markets during the past five years
    knows that there are many types of [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk),
    many ways to think about and measure risk, and invariably some risks lurking around
    the next corner that many of us have never bothered to contemplate. Most investors
    tend to focus their attention on equities and therefore have a tendency to think
    in terms of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and use that number to evaluate the
    relative level of risk, uncertainty or perhaps fear in the markets. That being
    said, during the past few years, almost everyone has become conversant in such
    topics as [credit default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps),
    the [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread), the
    LIBOR-OIS spread, bank capital ratios and a whole host of concepts and statistics
    which were not on their radar in 2007.

    Fed’s Financial Stress Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STLFSI),

  zh: 为了更全面地评估风险，我们总是可以参考[圣路易斯联邦储备银行的金融压力指数](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STLFSI)，这是试图将多种与经济和金融相关的风险因素（总共有[18种](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/st-louis-feds-financial-stress-index.html)）综合成一个单一的风险指数的一个例子。
- en: One aspect of market risk that many investors continue to struggle with is the
    currency carry trade. If the daily movements of the [dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar)
    are relatively unimportant for those interested in buying and selling stocks that
    are primarily based in the U.S., then it is relatively easy for most investors
    to conclude that the gyrations of the [Japanese](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Japan)
    yen ([FXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXY)) or Australian dollar
    ([FXA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXA)) can be dismissed as much
    less important than those of the dollar. Unfortunately, this is not always the
    case. It turns out that many investors, particularly large institutional ones,
    have an appetite for the currency carry trade, in which one borrows in a currency
    where interest rates are low and uses the proceeds to buy assets in a currency
    where interest rates are higher. With Japan’s central bank targeting interest
    rates of 0.1% and the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cutting its base rate
    to 2.75%, the carry trade is structured as an interest rate differential trade
    in which an investor can borrow in [yen](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Yen)
    and then buy Australian bonds, with profitability determined by the net interest
    rate differential plus or minus any fluctuation in the exchange rate.

  zh: 许多投资者在市场风险方面仍然挣扎的一个方面是货币 carry trade。如果美元的每日波动对于那些主要关注在美国交易的股票的投资者来说相对不重要，那么对于大多数投资者来说很容易得出结论，认为日元（[FXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXY)）或澳大利亚元（[FXA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXA)）的波动可以忽略不计，远不如美元的重要性。不幸的是，情况并不总是如此。结果证明，许多投资者，尤其是大型机构投资者，对于货币
    carry trade 有着浓厚的兴趣，这种交易中，一个人以低利率借款，然后用所得资金购买高利率货币的资产。随着日本央行将利率目标定为0.1%，以及澳大利亚储备银行最近将基准利率降至2.75%，carry
    trade 被构建为一种利率差异交易，投资者可以借入日元，然后购买澳大利亚债券，盈利性由净利率差异加上或减去汇率波动决定。
- en: Naturally some more aggressive investors prefer to use the yen as a funding
    currency for the purchase of assets other than bonds, including U.S. stocks. The
    problem for investors in U.S. stocks is that when the yen appreciates sharply
    – as it did on Monday and Thursday of last week, as well as during today’s session
    – traders with short yen positions who are victimized by a short squeeze will
    be subject to margin calls and/or forced liquidations, which means that not only
    are they covering their short yen positions, but they are also selling any long
    positions in U.S. equities as both legs are unwound. For this reason, when the
    yen carry trade is in favor, U.S. equities tend to move in the opposite direction
    of the yen. Traders can monitor the strength of the yen by following the USD/JPY
    currency cross or the Japanese yen ETF, FXY.

  zh: 当然，一些更为积极的投资者更喜欢将日元作为购买除债券之外的其他资产的融资货币，包括美国股票。对于持有美国股票的投资者来说，问题在于，当日元大幅升值时——就像上周一和周四，以及今天
    session 中一样——持有日元空头头寸的交易者会受到挤压，面临保证金调用和/或强制平仓，这意味着他们不仅要弥补日元空头头寸，还要平掉美国股票的多头头寸，因为两腿都在解除。因此，当日元
    carry trade 受到青睐时，美国股市往往与日元的走势相反。交易者可以通过关注 USD/JPY 货币交叉或日元 ETF, FXY 来监控日元的强度。
- en: An alternative to focusing entirely on the yen is to monitor the PowerShares
    DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund ([DBV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBV)),
    which, as PowerShares indicates, “is composed of currency futures contracts on
    certain G10 currencies and is designed to exploit the trend that currencies associated
    with relatively high interest rates, on average, tend to rise in value relative
    to currencies associated with relatively low interest rates. The G10 currency
    universe from which the Index selects currently includes U.S. dollars, euros,
    Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, British pounds, Australian dollars,
    New Zealand dollars, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona.”

  zh: 专注于日元的一个替代方案是监控 PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund ([DBV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBV))，该基金如
    PowerShares 所述，“由某些 G10 货币的货币期货合约组成，旨在利用这样一种趋势：与相对较低利率关联的货币相比，相对较高利率关联的货币平均而言会升值。目前指数选择的
    G10 货币组合包括美元、欧元、日元、加拿大元、瑞士法郎、英镑、澳大利亚元、新西兰元、挪威克朗和瑞典克朗。”

    long three currencies at all times, updating these [holdings](http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/overview.aspx?ticker=DBV#indexweights)
    on a quarterly basis. The ETF is currently short the Swiss franc, the euro and
    the yen, with long positions in the Australian dollar, the Norwegian krone and
    the New Zealand dollar.

- en: As the chart below shows, DBV has been tracking the S&P 500 index quite closely
    for most of the past year, but that relationship has recently broken down as DBV
    has plummeted while the SPX has experienced only a mild pullback. Going forward,
    investors should strongly consider keeping an eye on the USD/JPY cross, the FXY
    ETF (which is optionable) and also DBV, which provides a much broader picture
    of the overall carry trade – and can also serve as a proxy for the risk this trade
    can pose to stocks.

  zh: 如图所示，过去的一年中，DBV大多数时间都在紧密跟踪标普500指数，但近段时间这种关系已经瓦解，因为DBV暴跌，而SPX只是经历了轻微的回调。往前看，投资者应该密切关注美元/日元交叉盘，FXY
    ETF（该ETF有期权）以及DBV，因为DBV提供了整体套利交易的更广泛画面——同时也可以作为这种交易对股票可能构成的风险的代理。
