- en: Stephen Few's name is started to mentioned in hushed tones, much in the same
    way that Edward Tufte's name is now evoked. Stephen's website and blog are mandatory
    reading for those who are interested in visualizations. Few has a wonderful sense
    of aesthetics, and always seems to ask the hard questions about visualizations.

  zh: 斯蒂芬·费的姓氏开始在低声中被提及，就像现在人们提到爱德华·塔夫特的名字一样。斯蒂芬的网站和博客对于那些对视觉化感兴趣的人来说是必读的。费有出色的审美观，并且总是似乎在问关于视觉化的难题。
- en: It was more than interesting to learn that Few had set his sights on Panopticon
    in a new article that is available from his website.

- en: Panopticon hosted Few at their Stockholm headquarters for a few days. This is
    a fact that Few is up front with at the beginning of his article, thus removing
    the perceptions of a paid-consultancy-for-favorable-review. Among other things,
    Few reviewed a visualization that Panopticon came up with called a Horizon Chart.

  zh: 全景图在斯德哥尔摩总部为费举办了几天。费在他的文章一开始就坦白了这一点，从而消除了给人以为了好评而进行有偿咨询的 perception。在其他事情中，费回顾了全景图提出的一种名为地平线图的视觉化。
- en: Few relates the genealogy of his encounter with the Horizon Chart, from initial
    puzzlement to an appreciation of the visualization. I have to admit that, when
    the Panopticon guys demoed the Horizon Chart to me, I was similarly befuddled.
    It seems like it is something of an acquired taste, but as you get more used to
    it, the visualization of the Horizon Chart becomes more compelling.

  zh: 费回忆了他与地平线图的遭遇的谱系，从最初的困惑到对视觉化的欣赏。我必须承认，当全景图的伙计们向我展示地平线图时，我也同样困惑。这似乎是一种需要培养的品味，但随着对它的熟悉，地平线图的视觉化变得更有吸引力。
- en: The only thing that I would like to see for this particular visualization is
    the ability to better organize the vertical axis. For example, instead of just
    listing the 50 stocks vertically, I would like to be able to group the stocks
    by sector or by supply chain or by trading pairs, so I can quickly compare how
    one stock did against its peers.

  zh: 对于这种特定的视觉化，我希望能看到更好的垂直轴组织能力。例如，不仅仅是垂直列出50只股票，我希望能够按部门、供应链或交易对对股票进行分组，这样我就可以快速比较一只股票与其同行的表现。
- en: Panopticon is striving for new and interesting ways to do visualizations for
    the financial industry. They started off with Ben Schneiderman's heatmap, and
    have started to progress outwards. Heatmaps are becoming more standard in the
    industry, and I am sure it won't be long before .NET charting vendors start to
    come out with their own variations of the heatmap theme.

  zh: 全景图正在努力为金融行业寻找新的有趣的视觉化方法。他们从本· Schneiderman 的热力图入手，并开始向外发展。热力图在该行业中变得越来越标准化，我相信用不了多久.NET图表供应商就会开始推出他们自己的热力图主题变种。
- en: Panopticon needs to continue to push the envelope and come up with compelling
    visualizations for the capital markets industry. I am anxious to see what fruit
    is borne out of Stephen Few's consultation.
