    But there are occasional exceptions that are almost interesting, like IEX’s new
    [fee](https://www.iextrading.com/docs/rule-filings/SR-IEX-2017-27.pdf). In essence,
    the new fee will charge liquidity takers an extra 30 mils if the “Crumbling Quote
    Indicator” is on at the time IEX completes an execution. [[1](#bottom1iexpricing)][[2](#bottom2iexpricing)]

    out a niche by using disincentives.

    it’s very likely that IEX would determine that the quote is “crumbling” by the
    time Thor’s order exited the IEX speedbump. Thor seems to be designed for click-traders,
    so it could delay sending its orders to Nasdaq and Bats by an additional 350us,
    preventing IEX from realizing the quote is about to “crumble” until after its

    If this fee is allowed, would there be anything stopping an exchange from levying
    a fee that depends on the market a millisecond in the future? What about a second?
    Or a day? An exchange could, for instance, charge 30mils extra if a trade is followed
    by a favorable price movement larger than 0.1%. With the revenue generated, it
    could pay a huge rebate to resting orders that are blown-through (by say, 1%)
    during volatile moments, compensating market makers for their losses. This could
    make the exchange’s order book thicker during high-volume periods, resulting in
    market share gains. It’s easy to see how such pricing could backfire, with the
    exchange having to make larger-than-expected payments if a tail-event occurs on
    the thickened book. And there is something uncomfortable about paying traders

    This would add another tier to the venue segmentation spectrum. Under the current
    regime, low-alpha flow is disproportionately directed to internalizers and wholesalers,
    forcing high-alpha traders to interact with each other on lit exchanges, the centers
    of price discovery. Perhaps a few ultra-high-alpha traders would be attracted
    to this new type of venue of last resort, particularly when prices are in transition.
