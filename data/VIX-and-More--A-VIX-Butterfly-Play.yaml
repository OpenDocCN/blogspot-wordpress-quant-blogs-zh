  zh: 我通常避免提出交易想法，但这里有一个我知道至少有一个交易者今天肯定会下的赌注：一个VIX到期前的[蝴蝶](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/butterfly)交易。
- en: The butterfly trade highlighted below is for illustrative purposes only, but
    should explain the approach. The idea is simple. This butterfly trade will make
    a profit if the special opening quotation ([SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ))
    for the VIX is between 46.80 and 53.20 – about 6.4% in either direction from the
    current VIX level of about 50\. In other words, if the VIX falls in a 12.8% band
    around the current price, the trade makes money.

- en: Of course a lot can happen with the VIX in less than a day, but in terms of
    trading, there are about 3 ½ hours left in today’s session. Before tomorrow’s
    open, there are several important economic reports, including January building
    permits and housing starts, as well as January industrial production and capacity
    utilization. If those reports don’t bring the end of the world any nearer than
    it is now – or indicate that all the economic problems are suddenly solved – then
    the VIX butterfly trade should be in good shape.

  zh: 当然，VIX在一天的不到时间内可以发生很多事情，但就交易而言，今天交易时段还剩下大约3个半小时。明天开盘前，有几个重要的经济报告将要发布，包括1月份的建筑许可和房屋开工，以及1月份的工业生产和产能利用率。如果这些报告没有让世界末日更接近，或者表明所有的经济问题都突然解决了，那么VIX蝴蝶交易应该会表现良好。
- en: Note that the maximum loss is about 56% of the potential maximum gain, which
    will happen if the VIX SOQ is ‘pinned’ at 50 tomorrow morning.
