- en: ', Ricardo Fenholz of Columbia University makes what seems (to me at least)
    to be a rather incredible claim: that it''s relatively easy to construct a portfolio
    that is guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500 over one year (or any other interval
    you like) and also has a limited downside during that year. The idea is the take
    the S&P 500 Index and tweak it a little, creating a portfolio with less weight
    in stocks with higher capitalization, and more weight in those with less capitalization,
    and presto -- you have something guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500, he claims.
    Is that possible? That easy? Here''s a little more detail:'

  zh: 一文中，哥伦比亚大学的理卡多·费尔霍兹提出了一个听起来相当令人难以置信的主张：构造一个组合，保证其在一年内超越标普500（S&P 500）的表现（或者你喜欢的任何其他时间段），并且在同一年内其下跌风险有限。这个想法是对标普500指数进行一点调整，创建一个在市值较高股票上的权重较小，在市值较低股票上的权重较大的组合，然后——据称你就得到了一个保证能超越标普500的东西。这是可能的？这么简单？这里有一些更详细的说明：
- en: To understand how this works, let’s consider the S&P 500 U.S. stock index. Suppose
    that we wish to invest some money in S&P 500 stocks for one year. Currently, Apple
    has a total market capitalization of roughly $500 billion, making it the largest
    stock in the S&P 500 and equal to approximately 4% of the total capitalization
    of the entire index. Suppose that we believe it is very unlikely or impossible
    that either Apple or any other corporation’s capitalization will be equal to more
    than 99% of the total S&P 500 capitalization for this entire year during which
    we plan to invest. As long as this turns out to be true, then it is actually pretty
    simple to construct a portfolio containing S&P 500 stocks that is guaranteed to
    outperform the S&P 500 index over the course of the year and that has a limited
    downside relative to this index. In essence, we can construct a portfolio that
    will never fall below the value of the S&P 500 index by more than, say, 5% and
    that is guaranteed to achieve a higher value than the S&P 500 index by the end
    of the year.[1]

  zh: 为了理解这是如何运作的，让我们考虑一下标普500美国股票指数。假设我们希望投资一些资金在标普500股票上一年。目前，苹果公司的总市值约为5000亿美元，使其成为标普500中最大的股票，占整个指数总市值的大约4%。假设我们认为苹果公司或其他公司的市值在整一年中不太可能或不可能超过标普500总市值的99%。只要这一点最终被证明是真实的，那么实际上构造一个在整年期间保证超越标普500指数表现并且相对于这个指数有有限下跌风险的标普500股票组合是相当简单的。本质上，我们可以构造一个组合，其价值不会低于标普500指数价值的5%，并且保证在年底时其价值高于标普500指数。[1]
- en: This is not a trivial proposition. If we combine a long position in this outperforming
    portfolio together with a short position in the S&P 500 index, then we have a
    trading strategy that requires no initial investment, has a limited downside,
    and is guaranteed to produce positive wealth by the end of the year. According
    to standard financial theory, this should not be possible.[2] Furthermore, the
    assumptions that guarantee that our portfolio will outperform the S&P 500 index
    appear entirely reasonable. After all, not for one day in the more than 50-year
    history of the S&P 500 has one corporation’s market capitalization come anywhere
    close to equaling even 50% of the total capitalization of the market. A 99% share
    of total market capitalization would essentially amount to there being only one
    corporation in the entire U. S. for an entire year. This seems like neither a
    likely outcome nor one that investors should take seriously when constructing
    their portfolios.

  zh: 这绝非一个微不足道的论断。如果我们同时持有这个表现优异的投资组合的多头仓位和对标普500指数的空头仓位，那么我们就有了一个无需初始投资、下跌风险有限且保证到年底能产生正财富的交易策略。[2]
    此外，确保我们的投资组合能超越标普500指数的假设看起来完全合理。毕竟，在标普500超过50年的历史中，没有任何一个公司的市值曾接近过整个市场市值的50%。整个市场的市值99%的份额基本上意味着整个美国一整年只有一家公司。这看起来既不太可能是结果，投资者在构建他们的投资组合时也不应该认真对待这个假设。
- en: What does a portfolio made up of S&P 500 stocks that is guaranteed to outperform
    the S&P 500 index look like? There are many different ways in which such a portfolio
    can be constructed, but one feature common to all such portfolios is that relative
    to the S&P 500 index itself, they place more weight on those stocks with small
    total market capitalizations and less weight on those stocks with large total
    market capitalizations. The weight that an index such as the S&P 500 places on
    each individual stock is equal to the ratio of that stock’s total market capitalization
    relative to all stocks’ total market capitalizations taken together. In the case
    of Apple, then, the S&P 500 index would place a weight of roughly 4% in this individual
    stock while those portfolios that use HFT to outperform this index would instead
    place a weight of less than 4% in Apple stock.

  zh: 一个由保证能超越标普500指数的标普500股票组成的投资组合是什么样的？构建这样一个投资组合有多种不同的方法，但所有这类投资组合的一个共同特点是，相对于标普500指数本身，它们更重视市值较小的股票，而相对较少关注市值较大的股票。指数如标普500对每个单独股票的权重等于该股票的总市值与所有股票的总市值之比。在苹果公司的案例中，标普500指数会对这只单独股票赋予大约4%的权重，而使用高频交易（HFT）超越这个指数的投资组合对苹果股票的权重会小于4%。
- en: The only condition for this to work, he suggests, is that the assumption that
    no stock in the market comes to dominate the market in the sense that its market
    capitalization comes to be a high fraction of that of the entire market. This
    is, as he notes, a fairly weak assumption, although the weaker you make the assumption,
    the longer the time interval over which this idea apparently works.

- en: Now, I'm not doubting the veracity of this claim. I'm just stunned that such
    a simple recipe could work, and can't see the intuition behind it. What if the
    high cap stocks happen to perform brilliantly next year, relative to the lower
    cap stocks? Wouldn't this portfolio with underweighted high cap stocks then underperform
    the S&P Index? I've had a quick look at

- en: That sounds very different from the quite plausible assumption about no market
    dominance of a single stock. Indeed, this seems like saying that, if one assumes
    that large cap stocks will perform poorly, and small caps stock better, then we
    can build a portfolio guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500 Index by weighting
    small cap stocks more heavily. Isn't that like assuming we know the future?

  zh: 这与关于单一股票没有市场主导地位的相当可信假设听起来非常不同。实际上，这看起来像是在说，如果假设大型股票表现不佳，小型股票表现更好，那么我们可以构建一个保证超越标普500指数的组合，通过更重重配置小型股票来实现。难道这不是在假设我们知道未来吗？
- en: But maybe I'm wrong. I'd be interested in the thoughts of others. The paper
    is quite dense and light on intuitive discussion of the logic. Fernholz suggests
    that perhaps the existence of these superior portfolios -- which require continuous
    rebalancing by high-frequency buying and selling of many stocks -- explains some
    of the very high profits consistently earned by quantitative high-frequency hedge
    funds such as Renaissance Technology's Medallion Fund. I think I find more convincing
