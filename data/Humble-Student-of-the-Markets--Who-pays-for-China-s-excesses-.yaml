    was also fueled by an infrastructure boom, initially to upgrade facilities like
    transportation, etc., which then morphed into a property boom because local savers
    had nowhere else to put their funds. Today, we are now faced with the specter

    unique and for which there are many historical precedents, is usually wealth enhancing
    in its early stages, and then becomes wealth destroying once capital is systematically
    misallocated. When that happens, debt rises at an unsustainable pace until we
    reach debt capacity limits, in which case the country will have a debt crisis.
