    accept that the failure in 1998 of Long Term Capital Management discredited the
    quantitative methods of the Nobel economists involved with it (Robert Merton and
    Myron Scholes) and their school of thought called “modern finance”...Ask for the
    Nobel prize in economics to be withdrawn from the authors of these theories, as
    the Nobel’s credibility can be extremely harmful. Boycott professional associations
    that give certificates in financial analysis that promoted these methods. Remove
    Value-at-Risk books from the shelves – quickly.

    to get out at any price, and like Niederhoffer getting busted in 1997, the market
    will punish you for becoming too big. Thus, the main trades that took down LTCM
    were a Treasury-Eurodollar trade, a volatility trade (trade on volatility via
    over-the-counter derivatives), and directional bets in emerging markets. Scholes
    and Merton were primarily marketing props, not strategizers, and they were punished
    as investors lost something like 95% of their capital. Thus, perhaps Merton and
    Scholes let themselves be used by people who took too much risk, but the validity
    of the Black-Scholes/Merton option model was independent of LTCM''s business model.
    The recent downturn also, is pretty independent of the Black-Scholes/Merton model.'

  zh: 最终，市场逼迫他们认怂，因为他们知道不得不以任何价格脱身，就像尼德霍弗在1997年暴跌一样，市场会因为你变得太大而惩罚你。因此，导致 LTCM 倒闭的主要交易是一笔国债欧元交易、一笔波动性交易（通过场外衍生品进行波动性交易）以及新兴市场的定向投注。斯科尔斯和默顿主要是营销噱头，而不是进行战略规划，他们被惩罚了，因为投资者损失的资本约为95%。因此，也许默顿和斯科尔斯让自己被那些冒太大风险的人使用了，但是布莱克-斯科尔斯/默顿期权定价模型的有效性是独立于
    LTCM 的商业模式的。最近的下滑也基本上与布莱克-斯科尔斯/默顿模型无关。
- en: Value at Risk is a broad concept, that basically is a framework that has as
    its goal estimating a 99% or 95% worst-case-scenario, over an arbitrary period
    of time (day, week, year). Now, clearly many people underestimated the risk in
    mortgage-backed paper of all sorts, but this error was not particular to Value
    at Risk, rather, the assumption that housing prices would not decline, which then
    lead to errors in your stress test, or whatever you call your 'worst case scenario'.
    This error was made at many levels, by investors, issuers, rating agencies, banks
    who warehoused these loans, regulators, etc. Again, Value at Risk is pretty independent
    of this error, though the error would be reflected in any VAR that had such erroneous
    assumptions (garbage in, garbage out). Further, Value at risk is pretty agnostic
    as to method, whether you use data with really fat tails, 99.99% worst case scenarios,
    whatever you want. Blaming Value at Risk for the latest crisis is like blaming
    soup, rather than sanitation, for Typhoid Mary.

  zh: '风险价值是一个广泛的概念，基本上是一个旨在估计在任意时间段（一天、一周、一年）内的99%或95%最坏情况的框架。现在，显然很多人低估了各种抵押贷款纸的风险，但这个错误并不特定于风险价值，而是关于房价不会下跌的假设，这导致了你的压力测试错误，或者你称之为“最坏情况”的错误。这个错误是在很多层面上犯的，包括投资者、发行者、评级机构、库存这些贷款的银行、监管机构等等。再次强调，风险价值与这个错误基本上是独立的，尽管这个错误会反映在任何具有这种错误假设的VAR中（垃圾进，垃圾出）。此外，风险价值对方法基本上是相当不拘一格的，无论你使用数据，包括尾巴很胖、99.99%的最坏情况，等等。因此，因为珠玛丽而责备风险价值是最新危机的就像责备汤而不是对莫氏德玛利痢疾的卫生手段。 '

    report from Taleb, perhaps a page always saying "risk=inf", because of course,
    we could lose everything in WW3, a new virus, all the banks fail, etc. Every assumption

    Not by preaching nor by rational argument (believe us, we tried). Not by evidence."
    So much for reasoned debate. But regardless of popularity, there needs to be something
    more specific than his strident calls to stop using Value-at-Risk, option models,
    and portfolio theory from business schools. What sort of principles are we going
    to teach? Clearly reality is more complicated than these models, but there are
    some good ideas in there, and they do have many applications, though one need
    common sense in applying these tools fruitfully. Perhaps, MBA's should be taught
    common sense? That is, in some sense, the case-study approach of the Harvard Business
    School, which walks through various scenarios, with all their idiosyncrasies,
    and while I think this is very useful as part of a curriculum, it needs to be
    balanced with boring tools, like learning about covariance and how that affects
    portfolio risk.

    这份理性辩论就够热情。但不管有多热门，相对更需要的是除了他强烈呼吁不再使用价值atrisk、期权模型和商学院的投资组合理论之外的更具体的东西。我们该教什么样的原则？显然现实比这些模型复杂得多，但这些模型中确实蕴含了一些好方法，它们也有许多应用，尽管在果断运用这些工具时需要常识。也许MBA应该教授常识？这，在某种程度上，就是哈佛商学院的案例研究方法，它涉及各种各样的场景，以及他们的种种特点，我认为这是课程中非常有用的一部分，但需要平衡的是学习特别无聊的工具，例如了解协方差以及它对投资组合风险的影响。
