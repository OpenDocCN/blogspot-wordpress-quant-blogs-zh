- en: For the first time in awhile, Portfolio A1 gave back some ground to the benchmark
    S&P 500 index last week.  Even with last week’s sub-par performance, since the
    February 16, 2007 inception, Portfolio A1 now has a cumulative gain of 20.7%,
    compared to a 3.7% loss for the SPX.

- en: After falling 7% last week, [Sinopec, a.k.a. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp
    (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp) has been dropped from the portfolio,
    victim of a rule whereby a position is automatically closed once it falls 20%
    from its high during the ownership period.  Also dropped were Norwegian energy
    and aluminum giant [Norsk Hydro (NHYDY)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=nhydy),
    but in this instance as a result of a declining rank from the stock ranking system.  The
    ranking system partly reflects several technical factors and picked up on the
    fact that NHYDY’s stock has also struggled and is down about 17% for the first
    two weeks of 2008.

    company:  [Tele Norte Leste Participacoes (TNE)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tne),
    an integrated fixed line and mobile telecom provider with a $9.5 billion market
    cap.  TNE joins long-time favorite [BRP](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=brp)
    to give Portfolio A1 an unusual mix of 2/5 Brazilian telecoms in this five-legged
    portfolio.  By design a focused five stock portfolio is intended to make significant
    bets in specific sectors and regions, but it is unusual to find this type of concentration
    in the portfolio, which uses a maximum sector weighting of 30% to place sector
    limits on all new purchases.  The reason there are currently two telecom companies
    in the portfolio is that [Mosaic (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos)
    has had such a strong run (up 175.7%) that it now comprises 42% of the portfolio,
    so that it is possible for the other four holdings to split the remaining 58%
    with two companies in one sector that do not total to 30%.'

    Norte Leste Participacoes (TNE)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tne)，这是一家集固定电话和移动电话服务为一体的电信提供商，市值为95亿美元。TNE与长期喜爱的[BRP](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=brp)一起，使投资组合A1在这个五腿的投资组合中有了2/5的巴西电信公司。设计上，一个重点五股票投资组合旨在对特定行业和地区进行重大投资，但通常不会在投资组合中找到这种程度的集中，该投资组合使用最大行业权重30%来对所有新购买进行行业限制。目前投资组合中有两家电信公司的原因是[Mosaic
    (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos)表现强劲（上涨175.7%）目前占投资组合的42%，因此其他四项持仓可以由两家公司平分剩余的58%，这两家公司在同一行业中不总计达到30%。
