- en: I have been writing about [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    since the launch of the initial duo of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ) back in January 2009
    and from 2010 onward I have been plotting all of them on a leverage/maturity grid
    like the one below. It is amazing how often various VIX ETP investors mentioned
    one of these charts when I talk to them. Even through the VIX ETP space has been
    relatively stable as of late, I have not updated this graphic since early 2014,
    so a refresh is long overdue.

- en: For those who have not been following along over the years, I have plotted every
    VIX-based ETP using leverage on the Y-axis and maturity on the X-axis. With the
    advent of what I am calling VIX strategy ETPs, I have isolated in their own box
    in the lower right hand corner a half dozen of these products whose characteristics
    do not necessarily imply a fixed point on Cartesian coordinate system.

    products. From previous incarnations, I have retained the presence of non-VIX
    legs (typically positions in SPX/SPY), the combination of both long and short
    legs, dynamic allocation of the legs and optionability. I have also shaded areas
    where there is high leverage/compounding risk as well as high roll yield risk.
    Not surprisingly, these risks converge at [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    and [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY), two of the more
    infamous VIX ETPs.  Another carryover is font color, where black indicates ETFs
    and blue is for ETNs.  This time around I have also added yellow stars for those
    ETPs with an average daily volume of 1,000,000 or higher and pink stars for ETPs
    with an average daily volume between 100,000 and 1,000,000\. Note that while [CVOL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CVOL)
    technically makes the cut, at today’s closing price of 0.40, any sort of meaningful
    reverse split to raise the price about 5 or 10 would highlight just how illiquid
    this issue is. In fact, only six VIX ETPs pass the one million share screen: TVIX,
    UVXY, [VIXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXY), VXX, [SVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SVXY)

- en: There are three new additions to this graphic. The most notable of these are
    [VXUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXUP) and [VXDN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXDN),
    which were launched by AccuShares back in May. These products deserve a post (or
    series of posts) dedicated to some of the issues surrounding them, but the short
    version is that high complexity, frequent distributions and consistent tracking
    errors resulted in a product that investors decided was not worth their trouble.
    The other “new” products is, [VQTS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQTS),
    the first ETP that tracks the [SPX VEQTOR Switch Index](https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-500-veqtor-switch-index.pdf?force_download=true),
    making it a relative of [VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)
    and [PHDG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PHDG), but one which uses
    a dynamic allocation to [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    to achieve a 10% target realized (historical) volatility. VQTS was launched in
    December 2014 and like most VIX ETPs, has struggled to reach critical mass.

  zh: 这幅图表有三个新成员。其中最值得注意的是[VXUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXUP)和[VXDN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXDN)，这两个产品是由AccuShares在五月推出的。这些产品应该有一篇（或一系列）文章专门讨论它们周围的一些问题，但简而言之，高复杂性、频繁的分配和一致的跟踪误差导致投资者认为这些产品不值得他们麻烦。另一个“新产品”是[VQTS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQTS)，这是跟踪[SPX
    VEQTOR Switch Index](https://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-500-veqtor-switch-index.pdf?force_download=true)的第一只ETP，使其成为[VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)和[PHDG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PHDG)的亲戚，但它使用动态分配到[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)来实现10%的目标实现（历史）波动率。VQTS于2014年12月推出，与大多数VIX
    ETP一样，它一直在努力达到临界质量。
- en: 'While the VIX ETP market is showing some signs of maturing, there are many
    new and exciting developments in terms of low volatility ETPs and more broadly
    in the ETP space in general. As I am currently at the [IMN 20th Annual Global
    Indexing & ETF Conference](http://www.imn.org/investment-management/conference/Global-Indexing-and-ETFs/Agenda.html)
    – and scheduled to speak on a panel, “Trading the VIX: Riding Today''s Waves of
    Volatility” with [Larry McDonald](http://www.lawrencegmcdonald.com/lawrence-g-mcdonald/),
    [Mark Shore](http://www.shorecapmgmt.com/mark-shore-background.html) and [Matt
    Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/) tomorrow – this seems
    like a good time to devote more time to writing and in particular to resurrecting
    the “and More” portion of this blog.'

  zh: 虽然VIX ETP市场显示出一些成熟的迹象，但在低波动率ETP以及更广泛的ETP领域中，有许多新的令人兴奋的发展。由于我目前正在参加[IMN第20届全球指数与ETF会议](http://www.imn.org/investment-management/conference/Global-Indexing-and-ETFs/Agenda.html)，并计划在“交易VIX：驾驭今天的波动波”的专题讨论中发言，与[Larry
    McDonald](http://www.lawrencegmcdonald.com/lawrence-g-mcdonald/)、[Mark Shore](http://www.shorecapmgmt.com/mark-shore-background.html)和[Matt
    Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/)一起，这似乎是一个专心写作的好时机，特别是要复活这个博客的“更多”部分。
