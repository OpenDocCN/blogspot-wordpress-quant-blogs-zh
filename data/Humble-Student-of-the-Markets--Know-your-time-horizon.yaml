    stocks melted up 200% or plunged 67%?" For investors with 30 year time horizons,
    the counter-intuitive answer is the 66% plunge in stock prices.

  zh: 有一个有趣的文章提出了一个问题，“如果股票上涨200%或暴跌67%，你会过得更好吗？”对于有30年投资期限的投资者来说，答案是股票价格的66%暴跌。
- en: As equity investors, we tend to focus more on capital gains, but as fixed income
    investors are keenly aware, there are two other sources of returns for investors.
    The first source is capital gains, the second is income (interest for bonds and
    dividends for stocks) and, lastly, re-investment return, or interest on interest.

  zh: 作为股权投资者，我们往往更关注资本增值，但固定收益投资者却敏锐地意识到，还有另外两种收益来源对投资者有利。第一种来源是资本增值，第二种是收益（债券的利息和股票的股息），最后是再投资收益，或者说是利息的利息。

- en: I once had a taxable investor client with an extremely long time horizon. The
    client was formed as a trust and most of the positions acquired decades ago, e.g.
    GE with a cost base in pennies. The low cost base of the positions made selling
    nearly impossible because of the capital gains liability, so the client adopted
    an investment policy of focusing on companies with a history of good dividend
    growth. That way, the current beneficiaries could enjoy a steady and predictable
    rising income stream. Bear markets were especially welcome, as we could "harvest"
    capital losses to offset the capital gains from the sale of positions with low
    costs.

  zh: 我曾经有一个拥有极长投资期限的客户，这家客户成立为信托，大多数股票是在几十年前收购的，例如成本基础为几分的GE。由于持仓的成本基础低，卖出几乎是不可能的，因为会面临资本增值的税收责任，所以客户采取了一种投资策略，专注于那些有良好股息增长历史的公司。这样，目前的受益人可以享受到稳定和可预测的上升收入流。熊市尤其受欢迎，因为我们可以在低位“收获”资本损失，以抵消低成本持仓的资本增值。
- en: I had a fruitful relationship with that client, but it was a disconcerting feeling
    when I called to report our quarterly results when stock prices were rising. I
    almost felt like I had to apologize, "Sorry, we made you money this quarter. Your
    portfolio went up by X%." Nevertheless, the strategy of focusing on dividend growth
    made sense as it should provide better overall returns in the long run for investors
    with sufficiently long time horizons.

  zh: 我和那个客户的关系很丰富，但在股票价格上涨时，给我打电话报告我们的季度业绩时，我感到有些不安。我几乎觉得我得道歉，“抱歉，我们这个季度让你赚钱了。你的投资组合上涨了X%。”
    尽管如此，专注于股息增长的策略是有意义的，因为它应该能为有足够长投资期限的投资者提供更好的长期总体回报。
