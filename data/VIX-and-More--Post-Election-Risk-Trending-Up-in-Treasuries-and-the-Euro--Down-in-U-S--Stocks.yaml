    risky and uncertain as a result of a Trump victory, yet the VIX is actually down
    31.4% since the election – ipso facto the VIX is broken.

    the first to point that taking an Americentric, equity-centric view of the investment
    landscape is dangerous and naïve.  More often than not, the issues that end up
    having a strong influence on the VIX are born on foreign soil and/or in other
    asset classes.  Just look at the recent history in

- en: In aggregate, the picture is a mixed one in terms of implied volatility, risk
    and uncertainty.  As is often the case, risk has become elevated in certain asset
    classes, such as Treasuries and the euro.  In other areas, such as U.S. equities
    – and their VIXian barometer – there are winners and losers, with the result that
    a net bullish outlook has moved equity implied volatility lower.  This is not
    to say that a Trump Administration – whose cabinet members and policy priorities
    are largely unknown at this juncture – will not increase risk in some areas. 
    More risk is certainly on the horizon and if history is any guide, an Americentric,
    equity-centric view of the investment world is likely to be slow in identifying
    those risks.

  zh: 总体来看，在隐含波动性、风险和不确定性方面，情况是喜忧参半的。像往常一样，风险在某些资产类别中升高，比如国债和欧元。在其他领域，比如美国股市——及其VIX指数计——有赢家和输家，结果是净看涨预期使股指隐含波动性降低。这并不是说特朗普政府——其内阁成员和政策优先顺序在此时
    largely unknown——不会在某些领域增加风险。更多的风险确实在酝酿之中，如果历史能提供任何指导，那么以美国为中心、以股市为中心的投资世界可能很难及时识别这些风险。
