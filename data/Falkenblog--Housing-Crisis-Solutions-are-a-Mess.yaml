- en: Mr. Frank's idea is that, for mortgages originated between the start of 2005
    and mid-2007, a lender and borrower would be able to agree on a federal refinancing
    plan. Lenders would have to write down their loan to no more than 85% of the current
    appraised value of the property – which means the banks will use this opportunity
    to unload the biggest stinkers in their loan portfolios.

  zh: 佛兰克先生的想法是，在2005年初至2007年中期间获得的抵押贷款，放贷人和借款人将能够达成联邦再融资计划。放贷人必须将贷款减记至不超过该资产目前评估价值的85%——这意味着银行将利用这个机会卸掉众多欠款最大的贷款组合。

    a reduction in the principal to market value. The Federal Housing Administration
    would then guarantee the loan, up to a total of $300 billion in total Frank Refis.'

- en: What a disaster. They have it right, all banks will only put things worth less
    than 85% in there. And then borrowers who borrowed too much are rewarded, all
    on the government's dime. Crazy.

  zh: 真是一个灾难。他们说得没错，所有的银行只会放置价值低于85%的东西在里面。然后，借贷过多的借款人会被奖励，而一切都是政府在花纳税人的钱。疯了。
- en: The funny thing, as the article points out, is that once housing values fall
    below the value of the mortgage, people just walk away. As housing prices have
    fallen more than anyone's memory, a sufficient number of lenders just didn't anticipate
    this, just as people didn't anticipate internet equity prices falling 75%, and
    that's their fault. But that's why you need to look at not just the collateral,
    but the credit score, because the credit score tells you a lot about willingness
    to pay, in that people with high credit score tend not to walk away from debts
    even if they can, or in the calculus above, it makes some economic sense. But
    I think most of this problem is centered on non-traditional residential mortgages,
    predicated on rising housing prices, involved too little money down, if any, too
    low credit scores, and insufficient incentives for mortgage originators. For example,
    there was an originator who received 3% on the mortgages he originated but only
    kept a 1.5% skin in the game, meaning he had zero incentives to do proper underwriting.
    But it is important to remember that no one will securitize his loans anymore,
    so that game is over.

  zh: 文章指出，有趣的是，有些人只要住房价值低于抵押贷款价值，就会走人。随着住房价格下跌超过任何人记忆，许多放贷人没预见到这一点，就像人们没预见到互联网股价下跌了75%一样，这是他们的过错。这就是为什么你需要看的不仅是抵押品，而是信用积分，因为信用积分能告诉你很多有关付款意愿的信息。高信用积分的人一般不会退出债务，即使他们能够这么做，或者在上述的计算中，它是某种经济理智。但我认为，大部分问题集中在非传统的住宅抵押贷款上，这些贷款都建立在不断上涨的房价基础上，涉及到的资金太少了，甚至没有，信用评分太低，抵押贷款起源其激励不足。比如，有一个放贷人创作了3%的抵押贷款，但只投入了1.5%的本金，这意味着他没有正确的贷款承保激励。但重要的是要记住，再也没有人证券化他的贷款了，所以这个游戏已经结束了。
