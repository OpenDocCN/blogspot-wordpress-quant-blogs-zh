- en: . It's an experimental paper, reporting the results of a cooperation game in
    which people try (of course!) to cooperate, but also have incentives to cheat
    and take more for themselves. If each pursues his or her own ends without regard
    for others, there's a tragedy of the commons in which a common pool resource gets
    wiped out. It takes cooperation and control over selfish actions to avoid disaster
    for everyone. Lots of experiments have looked at such matters before, of course.
    This one adds a twist.

  zh: . 这是一篇实验性论文，报告了一项合作游戏的实验结果，在该游戏中人们试图（当然！）合作，但同时也有作弊并为自己争取更多利益的动机。如果每个人都追求自己的利益而不顾他人，那么就出现了公共悲剧，共同池资源被耗尽。要避免对每个人都造成灾难，需要合作和对自私行为的控制。当然，之前的很多实验也研究过这些问题。这个实验增加了一个新意。
- en: The twist is to make the experiment more relevant to some of the tricky issues
    we face today in thinking about climate change, how to preserve the environment,
    etc. Someone who is today 60 years old doesn't have the same personal stake in
    avoiding climate change as someone who is 10, because the older one is much more
    likely to be dead by the time serious effects kick in. The twist in the experiment
    is to include this cooperation between generations effect. In effect, the experiment
    probes our abilities to cooperate with the future -- with people we will never
    meet. Clever idea to try to do this in an experiment, and I think they've managed
    it quite well.

  zh: 新意是将实验与今天我们思考气候变化、如何保护环境等棘手问题更加相关。今天60岁的人与10岁的人相比，避免气候变化的个人利益并不相同，因为年龄大的人更有可能在严重效应显现之前去世。实验中的新意是包括代际间的合作效应。实际上，该实验探究的是我们与未来——我们永远也不会见到的人——合作的能力。这个实验尝试做到这一点非常聪明，我认为他们做得相当好。
- en: Oliver Hauser and colleagues placed volunteers into groups of five people, which
    they called "generations." In a typical run of the game, they would give the first
    generation a common pool of 100 units of wealth, with each of the five individuals
    in this generation able to "extract"  between 0 and 20 wealth units from this
    pool. Their choice entirely as individuals. The people know that the wealth pool
    will be passed on to future generations ONLY if the current generation extracts
    no more than half of it (50 units). Hence, individuals caring about the future
    generation could choose to extract, say, 10 or fewer units, while those not caring
    could just take 20.

    some probability p -- say, 0.8\. Hence, there's a 20% chance that the game will
    just end, so no need to worry about future the generation, and 80% it won't, in
    which case the wealth resource will or will not be passed on depending how people
    act in this generation. This game repeats for a number of generations as determined
    by the random process (on average 5 for p = 0.8).

    aren't wholly greedy and readily reduce the amount they extract so as to preserve
    the resource for the next generation of total strangers. The study found that
    over 20 separate trials, about 68% of the individuals extracted no more than 10
    units. Even so, this wasn't enough the overcome the anti-social actions of a greedy
    minority which extracted so many units that the common pool vanished fairly quickly.
    In this set of experiments, there were second generations in 18 games, and only
    in 4 of them was the pool passed on intact through one generation. In the other
    14 it was immediately wiped out by over-extraction.

  zh: 在这种情况下，一切都会立即陷入混乱。有趣的是，许多人并不完全贪婪，并且会立即减少他们的提取量，以保留资源供下一代完全陌生的人使用。研究发现，在20多次独立试验中，约有68%的人提取不超过10个单位。即便如此，这也不足以克服一小部分贪婪的人的反社会行为，他们提取了如此多的单位，以至于公共池很快消失。在这组实验中，有18场比赛出现了第二代，其中只有4场比赛资源通过一代完整地传递下去。在其他14场比赛中，资源立即因过度提取而消失。

- en: As the paper notes, there are some results in game theory that -- in the context
    of rational, self interested agents playing normal public goods games -- show
    that this kind of trick gives very good results. When selfish individuals can
    be strategic about getting something back from their cooperation, they can do
    so. However, this standard result does not apply in this generational game because
    no individual can gain anything by being cooperative. The first generation of
    rational greedy people would simply vote to each take 20 units and the resource
    would be gone. Who cares about those people in the future, anyway.

  zh: 正如论文所提到的，在理性、自私的代理商进行正常公共物品游戏的背景下，有一些游戏理论的结果表明，这种技巧会带来非常好的结果。当自私的个体可以策略性地从他们的合作中得到一些回报时，他们可以这样做。然而，这种标准结果不适用于代际游戏，因为没有任何个体可以通过合作获得任何好处。第一代的理性贪婪的人会简单地投票每人提取20单位，资源就会消失。毕竟，谁在乎未来的那些人。
- en: But of course, that's only if people really are rational and greedy. What about
    real people? Here the experiments suggest something encouraging. In another 20
    trials, the researchers tested this protocol and found that now the resource pools
    never vanished even once, but were passed on and replenished by the unselfish
    voting of people for as long as the games persisted. The non-greedy norms of the
    majority, when linked to the coordinating mechanism of democratic voting, can
    overcome the greed of the uncaring minority -- in this very simple setting.

    Secondarily, that analyses of what is possible in overcoming these kinds of problems
    is misleading and naive if conducted in the framework of strictly self-interested

- en: We have shown that in the absence of regulation, a minority of selfish players
    consistently deplete available resources. By implementing median voting, however,
    this negative outcome can be prevented—but only if all players are bound by the
    outcome of the vote. Votes that are only partially binding, such as the international
    Kyoto protocol, have little power.

    cooperation with future generations. Real-world data are consistent with this

    people who recycle and try to take small steps to conserve energy, and had a really
    good laugh (all on his own) about their little minds and cute intentions to push
    our world in a better direction. All very silly, he said, because it will never
    amount to much. Nothing would really matter until it was determined what to do
