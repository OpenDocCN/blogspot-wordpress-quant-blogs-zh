    of statistical knowledge and insight brought to bear by a commenter by the name
    of Frank.

- en: I was therefore delighted to learn that as of yesterday, Frank has decided to
    share in more detail some of his analytical work and thinking in a new blog that
    is going by the name of [Trading the Odds](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/).
    Based on a set of initial posts, it looks as if Frank will be using his considerable
    statistical data bank to talk about weekly and monthly seasonality, RSI (2), mean
    reversion, correlation and other related issues. I have a hunch that anyone who
    appreciates the heavily quantitative and statistical approach to the markets taken
    by the likes of [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) and
    [MarketSci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/) will find Trading the Odds has a
    similar appeal.

  zh: 因此，我很高兴得知，从昨天开始，Frank决定在他的新博客[Trading the Odds](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/)中更详细地分享他的分析工作和思考。根据一系列初始帖子，看起来Frank将利用他庞大的统计数据库来讨论每周和每月的季节性、RSI（2）、均值回归、相关性以及其他相关问题。我有一种感觉，任何欣赏像[Quantifiable
    Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)和[MarketSci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)这样对市场采取定量统计方法的读者都会发现Trading
    the Odds有类似的吸引力。
- en: Given Frank’s body of work solely as a commenter on *VIX and More*, I would
    encourage readers to become familiar with his new blog. If anyone needs an additional
    nudge, note that today Frank addresses one of my favorite VIX quirks, [Weekday
    Seasonality of the VIX](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/weekday-seasonality-of-the-vix/),
    which looks at the ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    effect for VIX levels on Fridays and Mondays.

  zh: 鉴于Frank仅作为VIX and More的评论者所做的工作，我鼓励读者熟悉他的新博客。如果有人需要额外的推动，请注意Frank今天讨论了我最喜欢的VIX怪癖之一，[VIX的周内季节性](http://tradingtheodds.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/weekday-seasonality-of-the-vix/)，它考察了周五和周一VIX水平的“[日历反转](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)”效应。
