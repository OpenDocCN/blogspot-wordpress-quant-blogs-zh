- en: 'I am often asked why the performance of DVB is far superior in terms of CAGR
    to other oscillators such as the RSI2\. My answer is simple: the volatility of
    intraday Highs versus intraday Lows is far more predictable and relevant than
    close to close volatility in the current environment. I began to notice this while
    trading pairs in 2008, and subsequently realized that this phenomenon existed
    on most heavily traded markets. What is interesting is that this has historically
    been relevant across major futures markets far before the halcyon of index mean-reversion
    that was ushered in at the turn of the millenium in 2000\.  Whether this is because
    of the advent of high frequency trading, a pronounced jump in program trading,
    or a broad decline in retail intraday volume — or all three for that matter, it
    is quite clear that the highs and lows set support and resistance points from
    which there tend to be  predictable mean-reverting bounces.'

  zh: 我经常被问到为什么DVB的表现在CAGR方面远远优于其他振荡器，如RSI2。我的答案很简单：与当前环境中的日终收盘波动相比，日内高点与日内低点的波动性要可预测得多且更相关。2008年交易配对时，我开始注意到这一点，并随后意识到这种现象存在于大多数交易频繁的市场中。有趣的是，这在2000年千禧年之交引入指数均值回归的黄金时期之前的主要期货市场上具有历史意义。无论是因为高频交易的出现，程序交易的显著增加，还是零售日内交易量的广泛下降——或者这三者都是如此，都很明显，高点和低点设定了支撑和阻力点，从而有望出现可预测的均值回归反弹。
- en: The fact that this has existed in most liquid futures markets as far back as
    1985 suggests some linkage between the composition of market players and large
    speculative volume intraday. Perhaps such markets are geared towards taking advantage
    of natural tendencies in human behavior. Its easy for the leveraged futures trader
    to panic when prices finish near the lows of the day and be subject to overnight
    risk. The natural tendency would be to sell to the larger and more sophisticated
    market players and pay the a risk premium to avoid such risk. The opposite would
    be true when the market finishes near the highs, where an inexperienced speculator
    may choose to be risk-seeking and looking for a breakout. The speculator will
    pay a tax to gamble that resistance will be taken out to the large speculator
    or informed trader (ie Goldman or the Fed).

  zh: 这一事实自1985年以来在大多数流动性期货市场存在的事实表明，市场参与者构成与大宗投机交易量之间存在某种联系。也许这样的市场更倾向于利用人类行为中的自然倾向。对于使用杠杆的期货交易者，当价格收于当天的低点附近时很容易恐慌，并受到隔夜风险的影响。自然倾向是卖给更大、更复杂的市场参与者，并支付风险溢价以避免这种风险。当市场收于高位时，相反的情况会发生，此时，经验不足的投机者可能选择寻求风险，并寻找突破。投机者将向大型投机者或内幕交易者（如高盛或联邦储备系统）支付一定的税款以打赌阻力将被突破。
- en: The fact that bull markets make most of their gains overnight –and especially
    if they close near their lows of the day is yet a further tax on the nervous day-trader
    who will not only face the smaller point ranges offered intra-day, but also has
    a net negative expectation.In a bear market, all of the losses are made during
    the day and news flow can have an unpredictable and predominantly negative influence
    overnight. This makes it very scary to go long–especially at the lows and risk
    incredible losses the next day. Furthermore the trader also learns that if they
    choose to stick with shorting some of the most significant gaps occur overnight
    on positive developments, and the next day there is a stampede to buy that starts
    at the open. Hence it becomes scary to short overnight. **At the end of the day
    the market pays you to do the things that are hard to do or counterintuitive,
    and this is a classic example.**

  zh: 公牛市场大部分收益都在夜间实现-尤其是如果它们在当天接近最低点收盘，这对于紧张的日内交易者来说是一个进一步的税收，他们不仅会面临日内提供的较小点范围，而且还会面临净负预期。在熊市中，所有的损失都在白天发生，新闻流可以在夜间产生不可预测的且主要是负面的影响。这使得在最低点持有多头变得非常可怕，并且可能面临难以置信的损失。此外，交易者还学会了，如果他们选择坚持做空一些最重要的差距是在夜间发生的，出现了积极的发展，第二天开盘时就会出现抢购潮。因此，过夜做空变得令人恐慌。**归根结底，市场让你做那些难以做到或违反直觉的事情，这是一个经典的例子。**
- en: While I will not attempt to prove any of these theories in the current post,
    I would like to present a useful indicator that certainly supports my case that
    High/Low volatility is more important than Close to Close volatility. It is also
    valuable as a filter for mean-reversion trades regardless of whether you use close
    to close indicators or high/low indicators. The logic behind this indicator/filter
    is that there is a dynamic relationship between close to close and high minus
    low volatility. Furthermore in a subsequent post, I will show how to take a slightly
    more complicated approach to build a dynamic trading strategy to take advantage
    of this effect that is superior to the sum of its parts.

  zh: 虽然我不会在当前的帖子中尝试证明任何这些理论，但我想介绍一个有用的指标，肯定支持我的观点，即高/低波动性比起收盘到收盘的波动性更重要。它也是一种有价值的用于均值回归交易的过滤器，无论您使用的是收盘到收盘指标还是高/低指标。这个指标/过滤器背后的逻辑是收盘到收盘和高减低波动性之间存在动态关系。此外，在随后的帖子中，我将展示如何采取稍微复杂的方法来构建一种动态交易策略，以利用这种超越其部分之和的效果。
