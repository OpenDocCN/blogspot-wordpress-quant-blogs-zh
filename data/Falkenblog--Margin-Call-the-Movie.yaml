- en: Margin Call was an excellent movie, in terms of its direction and acting. The
    nightime scenes were emphatically in the darkness of night, even though every
    time I've worked after dark, we simply turned on all the lights (for some reason
    they would have meeting in the dark with ominous screens lit around them). Life
    isn't as simple and clear as in movies, which is why I like them when they are
    good.

  zh: 《危机时刻》是一部在导演和表演方面都很出色的电影。夜间的场景明显是在夜晚的黑暗中，尽管每次我在天黑后工作时，我们都只是简单地打开所有的灯（由于某种原因，他们会在黑暗中举行会议，周围有不祥的屏幕发光）。生活并不像电影中那样简单明了，这就是为什么当它们好时我会喜欢它们。
- en: But, the key was in creating an event that provokes a crisis, one that engenders
    all sorts of soul searching, backstabbing, pain, and ultimately resurrection.
    The event in this case was that the fired risk manager, the always awesome Stanley
    Tucci, highlights that the value-at-risk is greater than the value of the firm.
    Now, they don't say what horizon this VAR was for, but that doesn't really matter.
    The key is, everyone supposedly knows 1) the value of their portfolio and 2) stress-test
    and value-at-risk numbers for that portfolio. Presumably, as best as I could make
    out, the really shocking VAR used current 'volatilities' as opposed to stale historical
    ones, which given the VIX was at 15 for a long time, then peaked at 80, could
    have been an issue.

  zh: 但是，关键在于创造一个引发危机的事件，一个能引起各种深刻思考、背叛、痛苦，最终实现重生的事件。在这种情况下，被解雇的风险经理，总是非常棒的斯坦利·图齐，强调说风险价值大于公司的价值。现在，他们并没有说这个VAR是为了什么时段，但这并不重要。关键是，每个人都应该了解1）他们的投资组合价值，和2）进行压力测试和投资组合风险价值的数字。据我能理解的最好的解释，最令人震惊的VAR使用了当前的“波动性”，而不是那些陈旧的历史数据，而考虑到波动率指数（VIX）长期处于15，然后达到80，这可能产生了问题。
- en: Since when was a parameter like 'volatility' not presented with the results?
    In my experience, management isn't well versed on VAR details, but they are good
    on what makes a relevant stress test or assumed volatility, so I can't imagine
    this being as important as the movie implied (ie, they all got together for a
    4 AM meeting and decided to cover their exposure the next day). The idea that
    someone updated VARs for current volatilities, and discovered their portfolios
    were too risky and had to be exited immediately, is pure Hollywood.

  zh: 自从参数“波动性”没在结果中显示以来是从何时开始的？根据我的经验，管理层并不熟悉VAR的细节，但对于什么构成一个相关的压力测试或者假设的波动性是很擅长的，所以我无法想象这会像电影所暗示的那样重要（比如，他们在凌晨4点举行会议，决定第二天跟踪自己的风险敞口）。有人更新了当前波动性的VAR，并发现他们的投资组合风险太大，必须立即退出，这纯属荒诞的好莱坞。
- en: The risk, presumably, was merely from their pipeline of assets that they held
    in the process of creating various derivatives. If that was their total risk,
    they had an incredibly high leverage.

  zh: 风险很可能仅仅来自于他们持有用于创造各种衍生品的资产流水线。如果那是他们的总风险，他们的杠杆率就高得惊人。
- en: But, that's all sniping. I thought it was a pretty good movie. The problem is
    that if you discovered that mortgages were overpriced in 2008 by 20%, that wouldn't
    imply the amount of panic showed in the movie. You would have weeks, if not months,
    to exit positions, not the 'day' the movie used. Big mistakes like that are systematic
    errors that are not going to change overnight. Even Enron's stock took months
    to fall, so it's never the case you have to sell your entire portfolio of an asset
    overnight, especially for something correlated with so many highly liquid alternative
    assets.

  zh: 但这都是鸡毛蒜皮的事。我觉得这是一部非常好的电影。问题在于，如果你在2008年发现房利美估价过高了20%，那并不意味着电影中所展示的那种程度的恐慌。你将有数周，甚至数月的时间来出售头寸，而不是电影中所使用的“一天”。大的错误像这样系统性的错误并不会在一夜之间改变。甚至连安然公司的股票都要数月时间下跌，所以从来不会有你必须在一夜之间出售你所有与那么多高度流动性的替代资产相关的投资组合的情形。
