- en: The infamous Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) has been the subject of rancorous
    and unresolved debate for decades. It's often used to assert that markets don't
    need regulation or oversight because they have a remarkable power to get prices
    just about right (stocks, bonds and other assets have their correct "fundamental
    values"), and so never get too much out of balance. Somehow the idea still gets
    lots of attention even after the recent crisis.

    Physicist Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and colleagues from the hedge fund Capital Fund
    management have explored the subtle nature of how new market orders arrive in
    the market and initiate trades. A market order is a request by an investor to
    either buy or sell a certain volume of an asset. In the view of the EMH, these
    orders should arrive in markets at random, driven by the randomness of arriving
    news. If one piece of news is positive for some stock, influencing someone to
    place a market buy order, there's no reason to expect that the next piece of news
    is therefore more likely also to be positive and to trigger another. So there
    shouldn't be any observed correlation in the times when buy or sell orders enter
    the market. But there is.

    (along with Eugene Fama) of the EMH, who established that prices should fluctuate
    randomly and be impossible to predict in a market that is "informationally efficient,"
    i.e. in which participants bring all possible information to bear in trying to
    anticipate the future. If such efficient information processing goes on in the
    market, then prices will fluctuate randomly. Informational efficiency is what
    Lucas and others claim the market does, and they take the difficulty of predicting

- en: Think carefully about this. The statement that information efficiency implies
    random price movements in no way implies the opposite -- that random price movements
    imply that information is being processed efficiently, although many people seem
    to want to draw this conclusion. Just suppose (to illustrate the point) that investors
    in some market make their decisions to buy and sell by flipping coins. Their actions
    would bring absolutely no information into the market, yet prices would fluctuate
    randomly and the market would be hard to predict. It would be far better and more
    honest to call the weak form of the EMH the Random Market Hypothesis or the Market
    Unpredictability Hypothesis. It is strictly speaking false, as we just noted,
    although still a useful, crude first approximation. It's about as true as it is

    under consideration) reflect all publicly available information, so these assets
    have the correct values in view of this information.That is, investors quickly
    pounce on any new information that becomes public, buy or sell accordingly, and
    the supply and demand in the market works its wonders so prices take their fundamental
    values (instantaneously, it is often said, or at least very quickly). This version
    has one big advantage already over the weak form of the EMH -- it actually makes
    an assertion about information, and so might plausibly say something about the
    efficiency with which the market absorbs and processes information. However, there
    are many vague terms here. What do we mean precisely by "public"? How quickly
    are the prices supposed to reflect the new information? Minutes? Days? Weeks?
    This isn't specified.

  zh: EMH的半强式版本。它断言，股票或其他资产（考虑中的市场）的价格反映了所有公开可用的信息，因此这些资产在这种信息下具有正确的价值。也就是说，投资者会迅速抓住任何成为公开信息的新信息，相应地买入或卖出，市场供求关系发挥了神奇的作用，价格瞬间（通常说，或至少很快）反映了其基本价值。这个版本已经比弱式EMH有一个很大的优势——它实际上对信息提出了一个断言，因此可能会合理地说明市场吸收和处理信息的效率。然而，这里有很多模糊的术语。我们精确地是什么意思“公开”？价格应该多快反映新信息？分钟？天？周？这没有指定。
