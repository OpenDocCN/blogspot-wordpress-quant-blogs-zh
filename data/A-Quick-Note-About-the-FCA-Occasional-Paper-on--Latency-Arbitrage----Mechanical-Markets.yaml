    that estimates a “latency arbitrage tax” on global investors of $5B/yr. The paper
    shows some interesting statistics on a unique dataset, raw messages sent to the
    LSE which are captured and timestamped by one of LSE’s TAPs. Unfortunately, I
    don’t see how the activity measured in the paper resembles anything approaching
    a “tax”. I’ve only had a short time to read the paper, so I apologize if I’ve
    made any errors. And the paper does not necessarily reflect the views of the FCA.

  zh: Aquilina、Budish 和 O’Neill（ABO）今天发表了一篇[论文](https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/occasional-papers/occasional-paper-no-50-quantifying-high-frequency-trading-arms-race-new-methodology)关于“HFT
    赛跑”，[头条](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ultrafast-trading-costs-stock-investors-nearly-5-billion-a-year-study-says-11580126036)估计全球投资者每年要支付
    50 亿美元的“延迟套利税”。论文展示了一些有趣的统计数据，这些数据来自一组独特的数据集，即发送到 LSE 的原始消息，由 LSE 的 TAP 之一捕获和时间戳。不幸的是，我不明白论文中衡量的活动如何类似于“税收”。我只有很短的时间来阅读论文，所以如果我有任何错误，我很抱歉。并且论文不一定代表
    FCA 的观点。
- en: Essentially ABO measure messaging activity that occurs in short bursts, particularly
    batches of marketable orders — possibly accompanied by cancel-requests — where
    some of the later orders or cancel-requests fail because an earlier message succeeded.
    E.g. if 3 marketable orders (from different trader IDs) are sent in short succession
    when the order book only has the quantity available to fill one of them, then
    that is identified as a “race” which the first order wins and the later 2 orders
    lose. Similarly, a “race” is also identified if the LSE receives marketable orders
    shortly before it receives cancel requests for the matched resting orders. In
    this case, the failed cancel-requests are the losers of the “race”. The authors
    provide event counts, volume, and estimated profit for race-winners — where they
    vary the duration window to identify a “race”, as well as other parameters such
    as race-type. The headline number of a 0.42bp “tax” is the race-winners’ estimated
    profits as a share of total volume, where the race window is set to 500us.

  zh: 本质上，ABO（Aquilina、Budish 和 O’Neill）衡量了发生在短时间内的消息活动，特别是一批可营销订单——可能伴随着取消请求——其中一些较晚的订单或取消请求失败，因为较早的消息成功了。例如，如果在订单簿仅有足以填充其中一个订单的数量时，以短时间间隔发送了
    3 个可营销订单（来自不同的交易员 ID），那么将其识别为“比赛”，第一个订单获胜，而后来的 2 个订单失败。类似地，如果 LSE 在接到匹配的挂单之前短时间内接收到可营销订单，然后接收到取消匹配挂单的请求，也会识别为“比赛”。在这种情况下，失败的取消请求是“比赛”的输家。作者提供了事件计数、交易量和估计利润给“比赛”获胜者——他们变化了识别“比赛”的持续时间窗口，以及诸如比赛类型等其他参数。0.42bp
    的“税收”头条数字是“比赛”获胜者的估计利润占总交易量的份额，其中“比赛”窗口设置为 500us。
- en: 'Figure 5.1 is a histogram (truncated at 500us) of the time-differences between
    the first successful message in a race, and the first message to fail (either
    by being too late to cancel, or trying to trade with liquidity that’s already
    gone). It’s no surprise that the distribution is highly-skewed, with a mode of
    5-10us and a 90th percentile of about 200us. And Figure 4.1 shows reaction-times
    on the LSE for a different type of event, which the authors use to estimate LSE
    latency at around 29us. Tables 5.5, 5.6, and Figure 5.3 also show the midpoint
    price trajectory after race events. The authors do a very nice sensitivity analysis
    that shows how the numbers vary if you change the race window and other parameters.
    It’s important to note that the longer the race window, the more it will blend
    messages stemming from different market events. The 500us window selected could
    help include failed messages sent across Europe on slow networks, but it also
    includes ~15 roundtrip times from the LSE — enough time for order books on correlated
    products to react and refill multiple times. One noteworthy measurement is in
    Table 6.3, which gives an idea of the volume that market-makers perhaps wish they
    could avoid by being faster: the approximate “profit” that marketable orders make
    from trading with someone who tried-and-failed to cancel within 50us. This number
    is very low, about 0.03bp, an indicator of a pretty efficient market where market-makers
    are not getting “picked-off” very often.'

  zh: 图5.1是一个直方图（截断至500us），显示了竞争中第一个成功消息与第一个失败消息（无论是由于太晚取消还是尝试与已经消失的流动性交易）之间的时间差。毫不奇怪，该分布高度倾斜，众数为5-10us，90百分位数约为200us。图4.1显示了LSE上不同类型事件的反应时间，作者用此来估计LSE的延迟约为29us。表5.5、5.6以及图5.3还展示了竞赛事件后中间价格轨迹。作者进行了一项非常好的敏感性分析，展示了如果更改竞赛窗口和其他参数时数字的变化情况。需要注意的是，竞赛窗口越长，将会混合来自不同市场事件的消息越多。所选的500us窗口可以帮助包括通过缓慢网络发送的失败消息，但也包括了来自LSE的大约15个往返时间，足以让相关产品的订单簿反应和多次补充。表6.3中的一个值得注意的测量结果给出了市场制造商可能希望通过更快速度来避免的交易量的概念：“获利”于尝试在50us内取消的交易方进行交易。这个数字非常低，约为0.03bp，表明市场相当有效，市场制造商并不经常被“击中”。
- en: Now, it’s very interesting to see statistics on these types of events, but I
    don’t see how they can be considered a “tax” in any way. All they show is that
    trading is competitive, and that traders may send messages even if there’s a low
    probability of success. As a real-world example, consider America’s favorite holiday,
    Black Friday. Perhaps your local toy store is selling the new Nintendo for $100
    off, but they only have 10 available with the discount. You know it’ll be a long
    shot, but you really want to catch some Pokemon, so you get up early and head
    to the store. You get there just in time to be 10th in line. A bunch of people
    arrive a few minutes later, but they all have to pay full price.

  zh: 现在，看到这些类型事件的统计数据非常有趣，但我不明白它们如何能被视为任何形式的“税收”。它们只是显示交易具有竞争性，并且即使成功的可能性很低，交易者也可能发送消息。作为一个现实世界的例子，考虑美国最喜欢的假期，黑色星期五。也许你当地的玩具店正在以100美元的折扣销售新的任天堂，但他们只有10个有折扣。你知道这将是一个很小的希望，但你真的想要抓住一些宝可梦，所以你早早起床去了店里。你恰好赶上是第十个排队的人。几分钟后，一群人到达了，但他们都必须付全价。

    I suppose Nintendo could forbid discounts, and maybe everyone else could get 0.004%
    off, but Nintendo gets to decide how to sell their wares. It’s a silly analogy,
    but maybe stocks aren’t so different. If a shareholder prefers to disengage from
    this type of race, she can sell her stock in an auction if she likes. And the
    paper appears to suggest that a way to avoid the “tax” is to have everyone trade
    in auctions, referring to the batch auction proposal from [Budish, Cramton, and

  zh: 你对他们征税了吗？很难说。你先到了那里，你得到了奖励。你的时间和交通成本可能是浪费的。但在金融市场上，投资于确保单一价格法则的网络基础设施具有重要的[经济价值](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/high-speed-trading-networks-and-societal-value/)。我想任天堂可以禁止打折，也许其他人可以打0.004%的折扣，但任天堂可以决定如何出售他们的商品。这是一个愚蠢的类比，但也许股票并没有那么不同。如果股东愿意不参与这种竞赛，她可以选择在拍卖中出售她的股票。该论文似乎暗示避免“税收”的方法是让每个人都在拍卖中交易，参考了来自[Budish,
    Cramton, and Shim](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/HFT-FrequentBatchAuctions.pdf)（BCS）的批处理拍卖提案。
- en: BCS showed that even information seen and understood by many market participants
    essentially simultaneously — e.g., a change in the price of a highly-correlated
    asset or index, or of the same asset but on a different venue, etc. —creates arbitrage
    rents too. These rents lead to a never-ending arms race for speed, to be ever-so-slightly
    faster to react to new public information, and harm investors, because the rents
    are like a tax on market liquidity. BCS showed that the problem can be fixed with
    a subtle change to the underlying market design, specifically to discrete-time
    batch-process auctions; this preserves the useful function of algorithmic trading
    while eliminating latency arbitrage and the arms race.

  zh: BCS（Budish, Cramton, and Shim）表明，即使是许多市场参与者基本同时看到和理解的信息——例如，高度相关资产或指数价格的变化，或者同一资产但在不同场所的价格变化等——也会产生套利租金。这些租金导致了永无止境的速度竞赛，为了对新的公开信息做出的反应变得更快一点，这会损害投资者，因为这些租金就像对市场流动性的一种税收。BCS指出，可以通过对基础市场设计的微妙更改来解决这个问题，具体而言是对离散时间批处理拍卖的更改；这保留了算法交易的有用功能，同时消除了延迟套利和竞赛。
- en: Of course, auction prices are still partly set by proprietary traders, sometimes
    in a latency-sensitive way. The BCS proposal claims to eliminate “latency arbitrage”
    by having auctions every 100ms or so, with only price priority and ties broken
    randomly. To further prevent “latency arbitrage”, BCS proposes no pre-auction
    transparency. Normal exchange auctions have a long period of transparency before
    the final match occurs, in order to attract liquidity and ensure a sensible price.
    This transparency often takes the form of a partly displayed order book (e.g.
    on many futures [exchanges](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Indicative+Opening+Price+and+Quantity)),
    or indicative pricing and order imbalances (e.g. on many equities [exchanges](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OpenClose)).
    Pre-auction transparency does make trading somewhat latency-sensitive, but exchanges
    in the real world know that having an auction blind can result in chaotic pricing
    — even when auctions occur once a day on highly liquid products. Holding blind
    auctions so frequently that they have only 0 or 1 orders of natural liquidity,
    and where traders are rewarded with priority for aggressive pricing, is a recipe
    for disaster. Prop traders would probably make a lot of money off of the ensuing
    chaos, but the uproar might be so intense that few of them would recommended it.

  zh: 当然，拍卖价格仍然部分由专有交易者设定，有时是以延迟敏感的方式进行。BCS提议声称通过每100毫秒左右进行一次拍卖来消除“延迟套利”，仅具有价格优先权，并随机打破平局。为进一步防止“延迟套利”，BCS提议不进行拍卖前透明度。正常的交易所拍卖在最终匹配之前有很长一段透明度时间，以吸引流动性并确保合理的价格。这种透明度通常采取部分显示的订单簿形式（例如，在许多期货[交易所](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Indicative+Opening+Price+and+Quantity)上），或者指示性定价和订单不平衡（例如，在许多股票[交易所](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=OpenClose)上）。拍卖前透明度确实使交易在某种程度上对延迟敏感，但现实世界中的交易所知道进行盲目拍卖可能会导致混乱的定价，即使在高流动性产品每天只进行一次拍卖的情况下也是如此。如此频繁地进行盲目拍卖，以至于它们只有0或1个自然流动性订单，并且交易者因积极定价而获得优先权，这是一场灾难的开始。专业交易者可能会在随后的混乱中赚取大笔资金，但是骚动可能会如此激烈，以至于很少有人会推荐这样做。
- en: 'More generally, there is a tradeoff between immediacy and liquidity. If you
    want to have liquid auctions, they probably can’t be very frequent. [Donier and
    Bouchaud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03758) suggest that for batch auctions to
    improve liquidity they should occur on the order of once per hour. I think most
    traders like auctions — BCS is right about that. And since we’re discussing pet
    market structure reforms with no chance of happening, I may as well suggest one
    that would give us more auctions and could save something of far more significant
    value: people’s time. The industry currently spends a lot of time keeping markets
    open when they probably [don’t need to be](https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-closing-time-the-stock-market-heats-up-like-a-bar-at-last-call-1521038300).

    for [11 hours a day](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-stocks-exchange-analysis/a-90-minute-cut-shorter-trading-day-comes-with-costs-idUSKBN1XH2M0).
    Stock exchanges could hold 2-4 sessions per day, each around 30-60 minutes long
    and overlapping with market hours in other major financial centers. This schedule
    could encourage working from home and a more clear demarcation of business hours

    - BCS在这一点上是正确的。既然我们正在讨论几乎不可能发生的宠物市场结构改革，我也可以提出一个可以给我们带来更多拍卖并可以节省更有价值的东西的建议：人们的时间。该行业目前花费了大量时间来保持市场开放，尽管可能[并不需要](https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-closing-time-the-stock-market-heats-up-like-a-bar-at-last-call-1521038300)。我们可以减少那段时间，目前很多专业人士每天在办公室里呆上[11个小时](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-stocks-exchange-analysis/a-90-minute-cut-shorter-trading-day-comes-with-costs-idUSKBN1XH2M0)。证券交易所可以每天举行2-4个会议，每个会议持续约30-60分钟，与其他主要金融中心的市场时间重叠。这种时间安排可以鼓励在家工作，并更清晰地划分不同时区办公室的营业时间。
