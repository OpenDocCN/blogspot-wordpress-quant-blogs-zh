  zh: 当我谈论[我的狗作为一个波动实验室](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-my-dog-can-tell-us-about_947.html)可能是我在这篇博客上写作的最有趣的部分，但还有一个波动的隐喻也应始终牢记在心：地震。
- en: Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, earthquakes are something I am forced
    to think about from time to time, whether I like it or not.  A little known fact
    is that approximately a half dozen small earthquakes are [recorded here every
    day](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Maps/122-38_eqs.htm).  Something on the
    order of 99% of these are not felt by humans and are picked up only by [seismographs](http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/quakes/seismo/).

  zh: 居住在旧金山湾区，无论我喜欢与否，地震是我不得不时不时考虑的事情。一个鲜为人知的事实是，这里大约每天都会记录到六次小地震。[在这里记录](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Maps/122-38_eqs.htm)。大约99%的这些地震是人类感觉不到的，只能被[地震仪](http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/quakes/seismo/)检测到。

    those rare occasions when I feel an earthquake, my second thought (the first one
    being whether I should start hedging my real estate investments with [CME real
    estate futures](http://www.cme.com/trading/dta/del/delayed_quote.html?ProductSymbol=SFR&ProductFoiType=FUT&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ProductVenue=G&ProductType=hng))
    is one of relief that an earthquake has reduced some of the stress along a nearby
    fault.  Without getting too deeply into the relevant seismology, it is generally
    accepted that stress builds up along faults as a result of [plate tectonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics),
    which describe the movements of the earth’s crust.  Since that stress can only
    be relieved through the forces released by an earthquake, if earthquakes are too
    few and far between, the pressure on the fault builds up and scientists start
    worrying about an increased likelihood of [The Big One](http://www.physorg.com/news70114196.html).'

  zh: 在我感觉到地震的罕见情况下，我的第二个想法（第一个想法是我是否应该开始用[CME房地产期货](http://www.cme.com/trading/dta/del/delayed_quote.html?ProductSymbol=SFR&ProductFoiType=FUT&ProductVenue=G&ProductType=hng)对冲我的房地产投资）是感到欣慰，因为地震减轻了附近断层上的压力。不过深入到相关的地震学，通常认为，由于[板块构造](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics)（描述地球地壳的运动），断层上的压力会积聚。由于这种压力只能通过地震释放的力来缓解，如果地震太过稀少，断层上的压力就会增加，科学家们开始担心[大地震](http://www.physorg.com/news70114196.html)的可能性增加。
- en: In much the same way scientists worry about large earthquakes in the absence
    of smaller ones, many investors should worry about the increased likelihood of
    a large VIX spike in the absence of smaller ones.  This same line of thinking,
    which I happen to agree with, would dictate that we should have been particularly
    concerned because the Dow had gone a record 949 straight sessions (almost four
    years) without a single day drop of 2% or more.  More stress on the investment
    fault had clearly been building up below the surface, increasing the likelihood
    of not just a 2% drop, but also of a 3% or 4% one day drop – which is part of
    the reason that Tuesday’s selloff was so sharp.

  zh: 在很大程度上，科学家们担心在没有小地震的情况下大地震的发生，许多投资者也应该担心在没有小波动的情况下大VIX波动的可能性增加。我恰好同意的这种相同的思维方式，会指出我们应该特别担忧，因为道琼斯工业平均指数已经连续949个交易日（几乎四年）没有出现一天跌幅超过2%的情况。投资断层线上的压力显然已经在地下积聚，增加的不仅仅是2%的跌幅，还有3%或4%的一天跌幅的可能性——这也是周二股市暴跌如此之大的部分原因。
- en: 'Those who are paying attention may wonder if we can have it both ways: can
    my dog and plate tectonics both explain volatility?  My dog would suggest that
    volatility clusters and trends.  Plate tectonics suggests that volatility oscillates.'

  zh: 那些关注的人可能会想知道是否可以两者兼得：我的狗和板块构造论都能解释市场的波动性吗？我的狗会建议波动性会聚集和呈现趋势。板块构造论则暗示波动性会震荡。
- en: In fact, volatility clusters and trends in the short term in the same manner
    that large earthquakes sometimes trigger secondary earthquakes (aka “aftershocks”
    – akin to [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-spikes-and-echo-volatility.html))
    and are preceded by smaller earthquakes that are [helpful in predicting large
    earthquakes](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040113080708.htm).  Over
    the longer term, however, my dog goes back to sleep, stress on the fault is relieved
    and volatility reverts to the mean – until the pressure on the fault starts to
    build up again and the cycle is repeated.

  zh: 实际上，波动性在短期内会像大地震有时会触发次级地震（即“余震”——与[回声波动性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-spikes-and-echo-volatility.html)相似）一样聚集和呈现趋势，并且在大地震之前会有较小的地震，这些小型地震在预测大地震方面[是有帮助的](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040113080708.htm)。然而，从更长远的角度来看，我的狗会回去睡觉，断层上的压力得到缓解，波动性会回归平均值——直到断层上的压力再次开始积累，这个过程会再次重复。
