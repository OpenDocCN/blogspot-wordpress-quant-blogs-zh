    simple answer is of course "yes," technology in manufacturing, for example, is
    clearly replacing human workers on a massive scale. It''s true elsewhere too:
    many of the poorly written finance articles you see today are also written by
    machines. But technology also creates jobs, and the bigger question is whether
    it creates more than it destroys. The article looks at the work of MIT researchers
    Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew MacAfee who argue based on productivity data that
    technology is now on balance eliminating jobs, and is in large part responsible
    for slow growth in employment:'

  zh: 探讨了一个重要问题：技术是否使人们失业？这个简单的答案当然是“是的”，例如在制造业中，技术显然在大规模地取代人力。在其他领域也是如此：你今天看到的许多写作拙劣的金融文章也是由机器编写的。但技术也创造工作，更大的问题是它是否创造的比破坏的多。文章研究了麻省理工学院研究人员埃里克·布林乔夫森和安德鲁·麦克菲的工作，他们根据生产力数据认为，技术现在总体上正在消除工作，并且在就业增长缓慢中起了很大作用：
- en: Given his calm and reasoned academic demeanor, it is easy to miss just how provocative
    Erik Brynjolfsson’s contention really is. ­Brynjolfsson, a professor at the MIT
    Sloan School of Management, and his collaborator and coauthor Andrew McAfee have
    been arguing for the last year and a half that impressive advances in computer
    technology—from improved industrial robotics to automated translation services—are
    largely behind the sluggish employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
    more ominous for workers, the MIT academics foresee dismal prospects for many
    types of jobs as these powerful new technologies are increasingly adopted not
    only in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in professions such as law,
    financial services, education, and medicine.

  zh: 鉴于他沉着冷静、理由充分的学术风度，人们很容易忽略埃里克·布林乔夫森的主张实际上有多么具有挑衅性。布林乔夫森是麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院的教授，他和他的合作者、共同作者安德鲁·麦克菲在过去一年半的时间里一直认为，计算机技术的显著进步——从改进的工业机器人到自动翻译服务——在很大程度上导致了过去10到15年就业增长的缓慢。对于工人来说，更令人担忧的是，这些强大新技术的日益采用不仅出现在制造业、文秘和零售业，还出现在法律、金融服务、教育和医疗等职业。

    to anyone who’s worked in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But Brynjolfsson
    and McAfee’s claim is more troubling and controversial. They believe that rapid
    technological change has been destroying jobs faster than it is creating them,
    contributing to the stagnation of median income and the growth of inequality in
    the United States. And, they suspect, something similar is happening in other
    technologically advanced countries.

- en: 'Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence, according to Brynjolfsson, is a
    chart that only an economist could love. In economics, productivity—the amount
    of economic value created for a given unit of input, such as an hour of labor—is
    a crucial indicator of growth and wealth creation. It is a measure of progress.
    On the chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines represent productivity
    and total employment in the United States. For years after World War II, the two
    lines closely tracked each other, with increases in jobs corresponding to increases
    in productivity. The pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value from
    their workers, the country as a whole became richer, which fueled more economic
    activity and created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the lines diverge;
    productivity continues to rise robustly, but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011,
    a significant gap appears between the two lines, showing economic growth with
    no parallel increase in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the “great
    decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is confident that technology is behind both
    the healthy growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.'

  zh: 根据布林乔夫森的说法，最具有破坏性的证据之一是一张只有经济学家才会喜欢的图表。在经济领域，生产力——为给定单位输入（如劳动的一小时）创造的经济价值——是增长和财富创造的关键指标。这是进步的衡量标准。在布林乔夫森喜欢展示的图表中，分别代表美国生产力和总就业的线条。二战后多年，这两条线紧密跟踪在一起，就业的增加与生产力的增加相对应。这一模式很清晰：随着企业从其员工那里创造更多价值，整个国家变得更富有，这又刺激了更多的经济活动，创造了更多的就业岗位。然而，从2000年开始，这两条线开始分离；生产力继续保持强劲增长，但就业突然出现萎缩。到2011年，两条线之间出现了一个显著的差距，显示出经济增长没有伴随着就业的相应增长。布林乔夫森和麦克菲称其为“大脱钩”。布林乔夫森表示，他确信技术既导致了生产力的健康增长，也导致了就业的缓慢增长。

    place in technological progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that technology
    boosts productivity and makes societies wealthier, but they think that it can
    also have a dark side: technological progress is eliminating the need for many
    types of jobs and leaving the typical worker worse off than before. ­Brynjolfsson
    can point to a second chart indicating that median income is failing to rise even
    as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s the great paradox of our era,” he says.
    “Productivity is at record levels, innovation has never been faster, and yet at
    the same time, we have a falling median income and we have fewer jobs. People
    are falling behind because technology is advancing so fast and our skills and
    organizations aren’t keeping up.”'

  zh: 这是一个令人震惊的论断，因为它威胁到了许多经济学家对技术进步的信仰。布林乔夫森和麦克菲仍然认为技术能提高生产率，使社会更富有，但他们认为技术进步也有阴暗的一面：技术进步正在消除许多类型的就业需求，让典型的工人境况不如以前。布林乔夫森可以指出另一张图表，表明中位数收入即使在国内生产总值大幅上升的情况下也没有增长。“这是我们这个时代的伟大悖论，”他说，“生产力达到了历史高点，创新速度前所未有的快，然而与此同时，我们却有下降的中位数收入和更少的就业岗位。人们之所以落后，是因为技术进步得太快，我们的技能和组织跟不上。”

    of being too optimistic about the extent and speed of recent digital advances.
    Brynjolfsson says they began writing *Race Against the Machine*, the 2011 book
    in which they laid out much of their argument, because they wanted to explain
    the economic benefits of these new technologies (Brynjolfsson spent much of the
    1990s sniffing out evidence that information technology was boosting rates of
    productivity). But it became clear to them that the same technologies making many
    jobs safer, easier, and more productive were also reducing the demand for many
    types of human workers.

  zh: 布林乔夫森和麦克菲并不是卢德分子。事实上，他们有时因对近期数字技术进步的范围和速度过于乐观而受到指责。布林乔夫森说，他们开始撰写2011年的书《与机器赛跑》，在这本书中他们提出了自己大部分论点，是因为他们想解释这些新技术的经济效益（布林乔夫森在20世纪90年代的大部分时间都在寻找证据，证明信息技术正在提高生产率率）。但对他们来说很清楚，那些使许多工作更安全、更容易、更高效的技术，同时也减少了对许多类型的人类劳动力的需求。

    the 20th century,” he says. “Many people, especially economists, jumped to the
    conclusion that was just the way the world worked. I used to say that if we took
    care of productivity, everything else would take care of itself; it was the single
    most important economic statistic. But that’s no longer true.” He adds, “It’s
    one of the dirty secrets of economics: technology progress does grow the economy
    and create wealth, but there is no economic law that says everyone will benefit.”
    In other words, in the race against the machine, some are likely to win while

- en: The story is of course more complicated than this. Lots of technology will work
    along with people and make them more productive. Over time, people can also learn
    new skills and move into new jobs, so the long term trend isn't clear. But I do
    find it hard to believe in the simple "the economy will adjust as it always has"
    argument for the reasons that rates of change and time scales matter. Technological
    advance is accelerating. The more technology we have, the faster we learn to create 
    still more. The only way people will keep up is if technology deployed on a massive
    scale also helps them learn new skills in an ever faster way. Is that happening?

  zh: 当然，这个故事比这更复杂。许多技术将与人类合作，使他们更加高效。随着时间的推移，人们也可以学习新技能并转行，因此长期趋势尚不明确。但我确实发现，很难相信简单的“经济会像过去一样调整”的观点，因为变化率和时间尺度很重要。技术进步正在加速。我们拥有的技术越多，我们学习创造的能力就越快。人们唯一能跟上步伐的方式是，如果大规模部署的技术也能帮助他们更快地学习新技能。这正在发生吗？
