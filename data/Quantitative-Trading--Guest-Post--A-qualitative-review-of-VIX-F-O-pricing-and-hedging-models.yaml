    series on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). These derivatives are written
    on S&P 500 volatility index and their popularity has made volatility a widely
    accepted asset class for [trading, diversifying and hedging instrument](http://www.quantshare.com/item-908-capital-allocation-based-on-the-expected-market-volatility-vix)
    since their launch. VIX Futures started trading on March 26^(th), 2004 on CFE
    (CBOE Future Exchange) and VIX Options were introduced on Feb 24^(th), 2006.VIX
    (Volatility Index) or the ‘Fear Index’ is based on the S&P 500 options volatility.
    Spot VIX can be defined as square root of 30 day variance swap of S&P 500 index
    (SPX) or in simple terms it is the 30-day average implied volatility of S&P 500
    index options. The VIX F&O are based on this spot VIX and is similar to the equity
    indexes in general modus operandi. But structurally they have far more differences
    than similarities. While, in case of equity indices (for example SPX), the index
    is a weighted average of the components, in case of the VIX it is sum of squares
    of the components. This non-linear relationship makes the spot VIX non-tradable
    but at the same time the derivatives of spot VIX are tradable. This can be better
    understood with the analogy of Interest Rate Derivatives. The derivatives based
    on the interest rates are traded worldwide but the underlying asset: interest
    rate itself cannot be traded.The different relation between the VIX derivatives
    and the underlying VIX makes it unique in the sense that the overall behavior
    of the instruments and their pricing is quite different from the equity index
    derivatives. This also makes the pricing of VIX F&O a complicated process. A proper
    statistical approach incorporating the various aspects like the strength of trend,
    mean reversion and volatility etc. is needed for modeling the pricing and behavior
    of VIX derivatives.**Research on Pricing Models**There has been a lot of research
    in deriving models for the VIX F&O pricing based on different approaches. These
    models have their own merits and demerits and it becomes a tough decision to decide
    on the most optimum model. In this regards, I find the work of *Mr. Qunfang Bao*
    titled [](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257099) [*‘Mean-Reverting
    Logarithmic Modeling of VIX’*](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257099)quite
    interesting. In his research, Bao not only revisits the existing models and work
    by other prominent researchers but also comes out with suggestive models after
    a careful observation of the limitations of the already proposed models. The basic
    thesis of Bao’s work involves mean-reverting logarithmic dynamics as an essential
    aspect of Spot VIX.VIX F&O contracts don’t necessarily track the underlying in
    the same way in which equity futures track their indices. VIX Futures have a dynamic
    relationship with the VIX index and do not exactly follow its index. This correlation
    is weaker and evolves over time. Close to expiration, the correlation improves
    and the futures might move in sync with the index. On the other hand VIX Options
    are more related to the futures and can be priced off the VIX futures in a much
    better way than the VIX index itself.As a volatility index, VIX shares the properties
    of mean reversion, large upward jumps & stochastic volatility (*aka* stochastic
    vol-of-vol). A good model is expected to take into consideration, most of these
    factors.There are roughly two categories of approaches for VIX modeling. One is
    the Consistent approach and the other being Standalone approach.**I.           
    Consistent Approach: -** This is the pure diffusion model wherein the inherent
    relationship between S&P 500 & VIX is used in deriving the expression for spot
    VIX which by definition is square root of forward realized variance of SPX.**     
    II.            Standalone Approach:** - In this approach, the VIX dynamics are
    directly specified and thus the VIX derivatives can be priced in a much simpler
    way. This approach only focuses on pricing derivatives written on VIX index without
    considering SPX option.Bao in his paper mentions that the standalone approach
    is comparatively better and simpler than the consistent approach.The most widely
    proposed model under the standalone approach is MRLR (Mean Reverting Logarithmic
    Model) model which assumes that the spot VIX follows a Geometric Brownian motion
    process. The MRLR model fits well for VIX Future pricing but appears to be unsuited
    for the VIX Options pricing because of the fact that this model generates no skew
    for VIX option. In contrast, this model is a good model for VIX futures.Since
    the MRLR model is unable to produce implied volatility skew for VIX options, Bao
    further tries to modify the MRLR model by adding jump into the mean reverting
    logarithmic dynamics obtaining the Mean Reverting Logarithmic Jump Model (MRLRJ).
    By adding upward jump into spot VIX, this model is able to capture the positive
    skew observed in VIX options market.Another way in which the implied volatility
    skew can be produced for VIX Options is by including stochastic volatility into
    the spot VIX dynamics. This model of Mean Reverting Logarithmic model with stochastic
    volatility (MRLRSV) is based on the aforesaid process of skew appropriation.Both,
    MRLRJ and MRLRSV models perform equally well in appropriating positive skew observed
    in case of VIX options.Bao further combines the MRLRJ and MRLRSV models together
    to form MRLRSVJ model. He mentions that this combined model becomes somewhat complicated
    and in return adds little value to the MRLRJ or MRLRSV models. Also extra parameters
    are needed to be estimated in case of MRLRSVJ model.MRLRJ & MRLRSV models serve
    better than the other models that have been proposed for pricing the VIX F&O.
    Bao in his paper, additionally derives and calibrates the mathematical expressions
    for the models he proposes and derives the hedging strategies based on these models
    as well. Quantifying the Volatility skew has been an active area of interest for
    researchers and this research paper addresses the same in a very scientific way,
    keeping in view the convexity adjustments, future correlation and numerical analysis
    of the models etc. While further validation and back testing of the models may
    be required, but Bao’s work definitely answers a lot of anomalous features of
    the VIX and its derivatives.  --- Azouz Gmach works for [QuantShare](http://www.quantshare.com/),

    F&O基于这个现货VIX，其运作方式与一般股指类似，但结构上它们之间的差异远大于相似之处。尽管在股指（例如SPX）的情况下，指数是成分股的加权平均值，但在VIX的情况下，它是成分股的平方和。这种非线性关系使得现货VIX不可交易，但与此同时，基于现货VIX的衍生品却是可交易的。这可以通过利率衍生品的类比来更好地理解。基于利率的衍生品在全球范围内交易，但底层资产：利率本身是不可交易的。VIX衍生品与底层VIX之间不同的关系使得它在意义上独特，因为这些工具的整体行为和定价与股指衍生品非常不同。这也使得VIX
    F&O的定价过程变得复杂。为了建模和预测VIX衍生品的定价和行为，需要一个适当的统计方法，包括趋势强度、均值回归和波动性等方面的各种方面。**定价模型研究**在VIX
    F&O定价方面，已经有很多研究通过不同的方法推导出模型。这些模型各有优缺点，决定最优化模型变得很困难。在这方面，我发现*包群芳先生*题为[](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257099)
    [*《VIX的均值回归对数模型》*](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257099)的工作非常有趣。在他的研究中，包不仅回顾了现有的模型和其他著名研究人员的著作，而且在对现有模型的局限性进行仔细观察后，提出了建议性的模型。包工作的基本论点涉及均值回归对数动态作为现货VIX的一个重要方面。VIX
    F&O合约并不总是以股指期货跟踪其指数的方式跟踪底层。VIX期货与VIX指数之间存在动态关系，并且并不完全遵循其指数。这种相关性较弱，随时间演变。接近到期时，相关性改善，期货可能会与指数同步移动。另一方面，VIX期权与期货更为相关，并且可以利用VIX期货更好地定价，而不是利用VIX指数本身。作为一个波动率指数，VIX具有均值回归、大幅上涨跳跃和随机波动(*即*随机波动率)的特性。一个好的模型预计会考虑这些因素中的大多数。对于VIX建模，大致有两种方法。一种是一致性方法，另一种是独立方法。**I.
    一致性方法：** 这是纯粹的扩散模型，其中S&P 500与VIX之间的固有关系用于推导现货VIX的表达式，根据定义，现货VIX是SPX的forward realized
    variance的平方根。**II. 独立方法：** - 在此方法中，直接指定VIX动态，因此可以更简单地定价VIX衍生品。这种方法只关注定价基于VIX指数的衍生品，而不考虑SPX期权。包在他的论文中提到，与一致性方法相比，独立方法相对更好、更简单。在独立方法下，最广泛提出的模型是MRLR（均值回归对数模型）模型，该模型假设现货VIX遵循几何布朗运动过程。MRLR模型适合VIX期货定价，但似乎不适用于VIX期权定价，因为该模型为VIX期权生成的隐含波动率偏斜。相比之下，这个模型是VIX期货的一个好模型。由于MRLR模型无法为VIX期权生成隐含波动率偏斜，包进一步尝试通过在对数动态中添加跳跃来修改MRLR模型，得到均值回归对数跳跃模型（MRLRJ）。通过在现货VIX中添加向上跳跃，这个模型能够捕捉到V'
