- en: 2) The dollar  has pulled back violently from its highs–much like it did in
    2008 in a similar situation before rebounding. Likely the short-covering in the
    euro has helped exacerbate this situation. Since the euro is in very deep trouble,
    and in a steep downtrend I see this euro rally/dollar decline as a temporary respite.

  zh: 2) 美元已经从高位急剧回撤，就像2008年在类似情况下一样，之后出现反弹。欧元的空头回购可能已经加剧了这种情况。由于欧元处于非常困难的境地，并且处于急剧下降趋势中，我认为这次欧元反弹/美元下跌是一种暂时的喘息。
- en: 3) The dollar has a negative correlation with the stock market because it is
    a carry trade/risk trade where speculators borrow in dollars to risk capital in
    other assets. Currently the spring/summer correction in the stock market found
    a temporary bottom and margin calls to speculators to re-patriate dollars are
    falling. Since the market is highly stretched to the upside in the short-term
    and is in a long-term downtrend with mixed probabilities in the intermediate term,
    the dollar has plenty of scenarios where it could stage a rally.

  zh: 3) 美元与股市呈负相关，因为它是一种套息交易/风险交易，投机者借美元在其他资产中冒险资本。目前，股市在春季/夏季调整中找到了一个临时底部，向投机者发出的追加保证金要求正在减少。由于市场短期内上涨幅度已经过高，并且处于长期下降趋势中，中期内的概率混合，美元有很多情景可以展开一次反弹。
- en: '4) Flight to Safety:  Current deflationary threats due to the employment and
    poor credit conditions favor bonds. The primary goldbug thesis for the dollar
    going down was the risk of inflation/debasement via excessive money creation.
     Bonds are technically bullish which confirms a perceived deflationary threat
    (see AGG for a pretty chart). Buyers of bonds internationally drive demand for
    dollars. Gold in contrast looks weak in the short-term at new highs and may not
    be as appealing to hedge fund managers since they likely buy into the goldbug
    thesis concerning the dollar. Gold is over-owned within the hedge fund community
    and could spontaneously correct several hundred dollars on a liquidation. Gold
    is often inversely correlated with the dollar, but is currently sitting near a
    peak in positive correlation (correlations are often mean-reverting in the intermediate
    term). An unwind of major gold positions could spark a rally in the dollar.'

  zh: 4) 飞向安全：由于就业和不良信贷条件带来的当前通缩威胁，债券受到青睐。美元下降的主要金融学论点是通过过度创造货币引发通货膨胀/贬值的风险。债券在技术上是看涨的，这证实了一种被认为是通缩威胁的看法（查看AGG获得漂亮的图表）。国际上购买债券的买家推动了对美元的需求。相比之下，金价在短期内看起来疲软，并且可能不那么吸引对冲基金经理，因为他们很可能买入关于美元的金融学论点。黄金在对冲基金界内拥有过多的持仓，可能会在清算时自发地下跌数百美元。黄金通常与美元呈负相关，但目前正处于正相关峰值附近（在中期内，相关性通常是均值回归的）。大规模黄金头寸的解除可能引发美元的反弹。
- en: 5) The dollar has become a mean-reverting instrument with long-term trend characteristics.
    This favors the current condition of being deeply oversold in an up-trend.

    a successful trade will probably work within 5-10 days.
