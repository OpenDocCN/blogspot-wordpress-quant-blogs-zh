- en: . It's a brilliant exploration of how economic theory is run through at every
    level with hidden value judgments which often go a long way to  determining its
    character. For example, the theory generally assumes that more choice always has
    to be better. This follows more or less automatically from the view that people
    are rational "utility maximizers" (a phrase that should really be banned for ugliness
    alone). After all, more available choices can only give a "consumer" the ability
    to meet their desires more effectively, and can never have negative consequences.
    Add extra choices and the consumer can always simply ignore them.

  zh: 。这是对经济理论如何在各个层面贯穿隐藏价值判断的精彩探索，这些价值判断往往在很大程度上决定了它的特性。例如，理论通常假定更多的选择总是更好的。这基本上是从人们是理性“效用最大化者”的观点自然而然地得出的（这个短语实际上应该因为丑陋而被禁止）。毕竟，更多的可用选择只能使“消费者”更有效地满足他们的愿望，并且永远不会产生负面后果。增加额外的选择，消费者可以随时忽略它们。
- en: As Aldred points out, however, this just isn't how people work. One of the problems
    is that more choice means more thinking and struggling to decide what to do. As
    a result, adding more options often has the effect of inhibiting people from choosing
    anything. In one study he cites, doctors were presented with the case history
    of a man suffering from osteoarthritis and asked if they would A. refer him to
    a specialist or B. prescribe a new experimental medicine. Other doctors were presented
    with the same choice, except they could choose between two experimental medicines.
    Doctors in the second group made twice as many referrals to a specialist, apparently
    shying away from the psychological burden of having to deal with the extra choice
    between medicines.

  zh: 如奥尔德雷所指出的，然而，人们并不是这样运作的。问题之一是，更多的选择意味着更多的思考和挣扎决定要做什么。因此，添加更多选项通常会导致抑制人们选择任何东西的效果。在他引用的一项研究中，医生们被呈现了一个患有骨关节炎的男子的病史，并被问及他们是否A.
    将他转诊给专家或B. 开处方给他一个新的实验性药物。其他医生被提供了同样的选择，但他们可以在两种实验性药物之间进行选择。第二组医生向专家转诊的次数是第一组的两倍，显然是因为他们逃避了处理额外药物选择的心理负担。
- en: I'm sure everyone can think of similar examples from their own lives in which
    too much choice becomes annihilating. Several years ago my wife and I were traveling
    in Nevada and stopped in for an ice cream at a place offering 200+ flavours and
    a variety of extra toppings, etc. There were an astronomical number of potential
    combinations. After thinking for ten minutes, and letting lots of people pass
    by us in the line, I finally just ordered a mint chocolate chip cone -- to end
    the suffering, as it were. My wife decided it was all too overwhelming and in
    the end didn't want anything! If there had only been vanilla and chocolate we'd
    have ordered in 5 seconds and been very happy with the result.

- en: I read a few years ago by economist John Conlisk entitled Why Bounded Rationality?
    The paper gives many reasons why economic theory would be greatly improved if
    it modeled individuals as having finite rather than infinite mental capacities.
    But one of the things he considers is a paradoxical contradiction at the very
    heart of the notion of rational behaviour. A rational person facing any problem
    will work out the optimal way to solve that problem. However, there are costs
    associated with deliberation and calculation. The optimal solution to the ice
    cream choice problem isn't to stand in the shop for 6 years while calculating
    how to maximize expected utility over all the possible choices. Faced with a difficult
    problem, therefore, a rational person first has to solve another problem -- for
    how long should I deliberate before it becomes advantageous to just take a guess?

  zh: 我几年前读过经济学家 John Conlisk 的一篇论文，题目是《为什么有限理性？》。该论文给出了许多理由，说明如果将个体的心理能力模型化为有限的而不是无限的，经济学理论将会得到极大的改进。但他考虑的一个事情是，在理性行为的概念的核心存在一个似是而非的矛盾。面对任何问题，理性的个人都会找出解决问题的最佳方式。然而，犹豫和计算是有成本的。冰淇淋选择问题的最优解决方案并不是站在商店里计算
    6 年，以最大化所有可能选择下的预期效用。因此，面对一个难题，理性的人首先必须解决另一个问题 —— 我应该犹豫多久，才有利于仅仅猜测？
- en: This is a preliminary problem -- call is P1 -- which has to be solved before
    the real deliberation over the choice can begin. But, Conlisk pointed out, P1
    is itself a difficult problem and a rational individual doesn't want to waste
    lots of resources thinking about that one too long either. Hence, before working
    on P1, the rational person first has to decide what is the optimal amount of time
    to spend on solving P1\. This is another problem P2, which is also hard. Of course,
    it never ends. Take rationality to it's logical conclusion and it ends up destroying
    itself -- it's simply an inconsistent idea.

  zh: 这是一个初步问题——称之为 P1 —— 在真正开始对选择进行深思熟虑之前必须先解决它。但是，Conlisk 指出，P1 本身就是一个难题，理性的个体也不希望浪费太多资源长时间思考这个问题。因此，在解决
    P1 之前，理性的人首先必须决定解决 P1 的最佳时间长度。这是另一个问题 P2，同样难以解决。当然，这永远不会结束。如果将理性推导到逻辑的结论，它最终会毁灭自己——它只是一个不一致的想法。
- en: Anyone who is not an economist might be quite amazed by Conlisk's paper. It's
    a great read, but it will dawn on the reader that in a sane world it simply wouldn't
    be necessary. It's arguing for the obvious and is only required because economic
    theory has made such a fetish of rationality. The assumption of rationality may
    in some cases have made it possible to prove theorems by turning the consideration
    of human behaviour into a mathematical problem. But it has tied the hands of economic
    theorists in a thousand ways.

  zh: 对于不是经济学家的任何人来说，可能会对 Conlisk 的论文感到非常惊讶。这是一篇很好的读物，但读者会意识到，在一个理智的世界里，这根本是不必要的。它在为显而易见的事情争论，只是因为经济学理论对理性如此着迷才需要。在某些情况下，理性假设可能使通过将人类行为转变为数学问题来证明定理成为可能。但它以千种方式束缚了经济学理论家的手脚。
