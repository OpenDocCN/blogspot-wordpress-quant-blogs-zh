    one. Next, wait two days. The market often needs time to digest its initial gains.
    Make sure the index doesn’t undercut its low. If it does, start counting over
    again.

    when the Dow, Nasdaq or S+P 500 jumps at least 2% on higher volume than the previous
    day. Ideally trade will also exceed its 50-day average. The bigger the price and
    volume moves, the better.

    criteria. Here are the charts for the major average ETFs. First, let's look at
    SPY. Day 1 of the rally, according to the above, was August 23\. On August 29
    (day 5), we had a rally of over 2%, but it was not on "higher volume than the
    previous day".
