    of the [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)
    ‘Sequential Portfolio’ by Michael Stokes at [MarketSci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/).
    In my opinion, Michael’s blog is required reading for anyone who is interested
    in a technical discussion of trading systems and approaches to developing trading
    strategies. Frankly, I was delighted that he decided to put the Stock of the Week
    (SOTW) through the paces.

  zh: 以防有人错过，我想强调一下Michael Stokes在MarketSci网站上对[股票周评](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)“顺序投资组合”的优秀讨论。在我看来，Michael的博客对于任何有兴趣进行交易系统和技术讨论的人来说都是必读的。坦白说，我很高兴他决定对股票周评(SOTW)进行深入探讨。
- en: MarketSci’s [Review of the VIX & More Stock of the Week](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/review-of-the-vix-more-stock-of-the-week/)
    examines performance based on a buy at the open at the beginning of each week
    and a sell at the close each Friday. This is different from the Friday close to
    Friday close data I have always reported in my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter),
    because I always wanted to report a cost basis in the newsletter on Sunday and
    assumed that if I avoided stocks which had news over the weekend, the difference
    between using a Friday close vs. a Monday open as a cost basis would not be meaningful
    in the long run.

  zh: MarketSci的[VIX & More股票周评](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/review-of-the-vix-more-stock-of-the-week/)分析了每周初买入并在每周五收盘时卖出的表现。这与我一直在报告的周五收盘到周五收盘的数据不同，因为我总是想在周日报纸上报告成本基础，并假设如果避免了周末有新闻的股票，周五收盘与周一开盘作为成本基础的差异在长期来看将没有意义。
- en: For the first year or so, the difference between Friday’s close and Monday’s
    open was not meaningful. During the rally from the March 2009 bottom, however,
    a good portion of the gains for stocks have come on Mondays. Earlier this week,
    Business Week cited data from [Bespoke Investment Group](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)
    which [attributes all of the gains](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-12/winning-strategy-for-u-s-stocks-buy-on-monday-sell-on-friday.html)
    in stocks over the course of the past six months to Mondays, with 80% of all Mondays
    being up days during this period.

  zh: 在最初的这一年左右，周五收盘与周一开盘之间的差异没有意义。然而，在2009年3月触底以来的反弹中，股票的大部分涨幅都来自周一。本周早些时候，商业周刊引用了[Bespoke投资集团](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)的数据，该数据[归功于过去六个月](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-12/winning-strategy-for-u-s-stocks-buy-on-monday-sell-on-friday.html)股票的所有涨幅都在周一，在这段时间内，80%的周一都是上涨的日子。
- en: In addition to the rise of ‘Magic Mondays,’ the SOTW also was prescient enough
    to flag Bell Microproducts ([BELM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BELM))
    as a SOTW selection the day before Avnet ([AVT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AVT))
    agreed to acquire the company for a 29.2% premium over Friday’s closing price
    two weeks ago. Unfortunately, the acquisition was announced before BELM opened
    for trading on Monday. After some deliberation, I included the acquisition-related
    gains in the performance data rather than rewrite the rules for tracking the performance
    of this portfolio after nine quarters of adhering to one set of standard practices.

  zh: 除了“神奇周一”的兴起，SOTW还预见性地标出了Bell Microproducts([BELM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BELM))作为周评选择，就在两周前Avnet([AVT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AVT))同意以比周五收盘价高出29.2%的价格收购该公司的前一天。不幸的是，在BELM周一开盘前，收购就已经宣布了。经过一些考虑，我决定将收购相关的收益纳入表现数据，而不是在坚持九个季度的标准做法后重新编写跟踪这个投资组合表现的规则。
- en: By all means, click through and see what MarketSci has to say about the Stock
    of the Week. By his calculations, a Monday to Friday holding period has yielded
    a 103.9% annualized return during a period in which the S&P 500 index has lost
    money. While a one stock ‘portfolio’ can hardly be considered anything less than
    high risk, I was also pleased to see the stellar 1.83 [Sharpe ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio),
    which is a standard measure of risk-adjusted performance.

  zh: 当然，点击进入并了解MarketSci对本周股票的看法。通过他的计算，周一至周五的持有期在标普500指数亏损的期间内实现了103.9%的年化回报。尽管一个单一股票的“投资组合”风险极高，但我也很高兴看到优秀的1.83[夏普比率](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio)，这是衡量风险调整表现的一个标准指标。
- en: For the record, this week’s SOTW selection, [UFS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UFS),
    is up 4.3% for the first three trading days of the week. Last week, [IPSU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IPSU)
    delivered an 8.7% return for the week. (Both calculations utilize Friday’s closing
    price as the cost basis.)
