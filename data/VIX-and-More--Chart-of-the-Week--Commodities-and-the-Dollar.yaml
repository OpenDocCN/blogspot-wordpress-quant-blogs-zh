- en: One of the market-moving stories of the week was a decision by Standard & Poor’s
    to lower their outlook for AAA-rated sovereign debt of the United Kingdom from
    stable to negative. This action caused ripples in the [currency](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies)
    markets, with the [dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar)
    coming under pressure after investors such as Bill Gross of PIMCO expressed concerns
    about the mounting U.S. deficit and potential future risk to the AAA credit rating
    for U.S. debt.

  zh: 本周影响市场的重大新闻之一是标准普尔公司将英国AAA级主权债务的展望从稳定下调至负面。此行动在货币市场引发连锁反应，投资者如PIMCO的比尔·格罗斯表达对美国不断增加的财政赤字和未来可能对美国债务AAA信用评级构成的风险的担忧后，美元承受压力。
- en: By the end of the week the dollar was at a four month low against the euro and
    [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities) were up
    sharply, partly because commodities are seen as an effective hedge against inflation.

  zh: 截至本周末，美元对欧元汇率创四个月新低，[大宗商品](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities)价格大幅上涨，部分原因是投资者视大宗商品为对抗通胀的有效对冲工具。
- en: In the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, I have captured a chart of the Rogers International Commodity Total Return
    Index ETF ([RJI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJI)) versus the
    U.S. dollar. The chart shows that commodities formed a bottom in mid-February
    and have recently attracted buying in higher volumes.

  zh: 在下面的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)中，我捕捉到了罗杰斯国际大宗商品总回报指数ETF
    ([RJI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJI)) 相对于美元的图表。图表显示，大宗商品于2月中旬触底，并最近吸引了更多买盘。
- en: Shortly after commodities bottomed, the dollar peaked and has experienced several
    sharp moves down. The drop in the dollar has helped to lift prices of dollar-denominated
    commodities and pushed money toward commodities as a potential inflationary hedge.
    During the course of the past three months, commodities have had two up trending
    periods, each of which was followed by a consolidation period. With the dollar
    breaking down and in danger of testing the December support level, commodities
    could be preparing for another upward leg soon.

  zh: 在大宗商品触底后不久，美元达到峰值并经历了几次剧烈的下跌。美元的下跌帮助推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，并促使资金流向大宗商品作为潜在的通胀对冲工具。在过去三个月的时间里，大宗商品经历了两个上升趋势期，每个之后都跟着一个震荡期。随着美元跌破支撑位并可能测试12月的支撑水平，大宗商品可能很快会迎来另一个上升趋势。
