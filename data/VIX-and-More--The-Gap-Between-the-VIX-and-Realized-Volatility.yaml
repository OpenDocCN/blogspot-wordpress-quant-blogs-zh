- en: Since making an all-time closing high of 80.86 on November 20^(th) 2008, the
    CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) has been declining in the direction of its historical
    mean of 20.22\. While the initial drop in the VIX took it rapidly from 80 to the
    40-50 range, it took some time before investors began to gain confidence that
    the March lows in stocks were going to be the bottom. Once the consensus began
    to build around the likelihood of a bottom and a historic buying opportunity in
    stocks, the VIX began a steady descent that has taken it all the way down to the
    mid-20s.

  zh: 自2008年11月20日创下的80.86点收盘高点以来，CBOE波动指数（VIX）一直在下降至其历史平均水平20.22点。尽管VIX的最初下跌使其迅速从80降至40-50点，但投资者需要一段时间才能确信3月份股票的低点就是底部。一旦市场共识开始建立，认为股市可能触底并出现历史性买入机会，VIX开始稳步下降，一直跌至20多一点。
- en: As the chart below demonstrates, as rapidly as the VIX (red line) has been able
    to fall, it has not managed to keep up with the decline in [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility).
    The chart records the closing VIX value for each day as well as the 21-day realized
    volatility (dotted green line) that results from calculating 21-day historical
    volatility 21 trading days into the future. These calculations allow an options
    buyer or seller to determine the extent to which the VIX (which looks forward
    30 *calendar* days) accurately predicted the realized volatility that occurred
    during the next 21 trading days or approximately 30 calendar days. The differential
    (VIX-RV) is plotted as the blue area.

  zh: 如下图所示，尽管VIX（红线）下跌速度很快，但它并没有跟上实际波动率的下降（虚线绿色线）。该图表记录了每天的收盘VIX值以及计算未来21个交易日21天历史波动率得出的21天实际波动率（dotted
    green line）。这些计算允许期权买方或卖方确定VIX（向前看30个日历日）对未来21个交易日或大约30个日历日的实际波动性的准确预测程度。差异（VIX-RV）以蓝色区域表示。
- en: One of the key takeaways from the chart is that at least during the last 2 ½
    years, the VIX frequently has been a poor estimator of future volatility. During
    the October 2008 portion of the financial crisis, the VIX often underestimated
    future volatility by 30-40 points. Since November, however, the VIX has been consistently
    overestimating future volatility. In fact, not since February 27^(th) has the
    VIX expectation of future volatility turned out to be lower than realized volatility
    21 days hence.

  zh: 图表的关键结论之一是，在过去的2年半时间里，VIX经常是一个对未来波动性的糟糕估计器。在2008年10月的金融危机期间，VIX经常低估未来波动性30-40点。然而，自2008年11月以来，VIX一直高估未来波动性。实际上，自2月27日以来，VIX对未来波动性的预期首次低于21天后的实际波动性。
- en: In other words, if you had been selling SPX options every day since the beginning
    of March, the dramatic decrease in implied volatility would have almost guaranteed
    that every day would have been a winning day.

- en: '*[While I have generally avoided using the term “realized volatility” here,
    it is synonymous with [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility),
    statistical volatility and actual volatility. All these terms reflect the conventional
    way of calculating the volatility of a series of changes in price, which is essentially
    done by taking the natural log of the ratio of daily price changes relative to
    the mean value for the data series. To the extent that I can avoid confusion,
    I will try to standardize on using ‘historical volatility’ when looking backward
    from a specific date and ‘realized volatility’ when looking forward from a date
    in which there are more recent historical data from which to derive the calculations.
    For the record, there are actually several ways to calculate historical volatility
    and one of these days I will finally get around to a series of posts on historical
    volatility, starting with the calculations…]*'
