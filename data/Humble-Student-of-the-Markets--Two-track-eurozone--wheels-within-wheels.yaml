- en: Angela Merkel has come to the realization that only the ECB can save the euro.
    She had the story leaked to throw panic into the markets to pressure the German
    hardliners within her government and the Bundesbank. In that way, it would give
    her political cover to give Mario Draghi the nod to start monetizing debt.

    typical European fashion, there seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes with
