    who monopolize the business media with their bullish rhetoric. Their tone is conservatively
    described as optimistic, and perhaps more realistically it sounds almost euphoric.
    After coming back from the brink of their complete demise, they are pounding the
    table with a little “I told you so!”  Remember one thing if you are a trader,
    you do NOT have to buy and hold. However, the mutual fund crew MUST buy and hold,
    and from a business perspective it is in their best interests to encourage investors
    and traders to do so. I for one believe this market is but a castle built in the
    air and ripe for a thrashing. That said, I am unwilling to go full bear here.
    I prefer to go in and out–long and short with little exposure and lots of cash
    at this point to reduce risk.  Renowned short-seller Doug Kass presents his view
    on the naiive optimism in the stock market: [http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718](http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718)'

  zh: 如今，空头论点已经消失了，被那些垄断商业媒体的买入持有派淹没了，他们用他们乐观的说辞来主导舆论。他们的语气保守地描述为乐观，也许更现实的说法是听起来几乎是欣快的。在从完全灭亡的边缘回来之后，他们正在大肆宣扬一句“我早就告诉过你！”。记住一件事，如果你是一个交易者，你不必买入并持有。然而，共同基金组织必须购买并持有，从业务角度来看，鼓励投资者和交易者这样做对他们最有利。就我个人而言，我认为这个市场只是一座空中楼阁，准备好遭受一番痛击。话虽如此，我不愿意在这里完全做空。我更倾向于进出——做多和做空，目前暴露度较低，现金充裕以降低风险。著名的空头卖空者道格·卡斯（Doug
    Kass）发表了他对股市天真乐观的看法：[http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718](http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718)
- en: '**How to play it:** If you are long keep your trailing stops roughly 10% from
    the current closing price of the index, or 10% on each stock in your portfolio
    that is above its 50 day moving average. Aggressive investors can trim exposure
    here and wait for a pullback to re-enter, or they can short with a 5% stop to
    the upside with 10 or 20% exposure. In my opinion the 200 ma still serves as support,
    and until the 200 ma is broken decisively for at least a week to the downside,
    I wouldn’t take full short positions (ie net 50% short or higher).'

  zh: '**如何操作：** 如果你持有多头，将你的跟踪止损设置在当前指数收盘价的大约10%处，或者在你的投资组合中每支股票的50日移动平均线以上的10%处。积极的投资者可以在此处减少敞口，等待回撤重新进场，或者他们可以选择以5%的上限止损做空，敞口为10%或20%。在我看来，200日移动平均线仍然起到支撑作用，直到至少一个星期内200日移动平均线被明确突破为止，我不会采取完全的空头头寸（即净空头头寸达到50%或更高）。'
