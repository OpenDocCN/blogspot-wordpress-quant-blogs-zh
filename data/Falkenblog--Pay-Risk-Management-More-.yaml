    as much as the dealmakers". When I was in risk management and went to conferences,
    there were three common themes:'

  zh: 在这场骚动中，我经常听到有人说：“我们应该像待遇交易者一样待遇风险管理者”。当我在风险管理工作并参加会议时，有三个常见主题：

  zh: 1\. 风险管理不是一个模型，而是良好的判断力（别考我！）

  zh: 3\. 你需要为优秀的风险管理者支付薪酬（给我加薪）
- en: But the problem with paying risk management as much as the business lines is
    that risk management is about preventing improbable events from happening, and
    so it is very difficult to know if they are doing a good job. Someone might say,
    this is a great risk management system, but the problem is that for 8 years out
    of 10, there is no difference between a great and poor risk management system.
    Then, when the cycle does crash, and your crackerjack team of risk managers prevents
    the Commercial Real Estate disaster of 1990, you will find your team overconfident,
    and constraining Commercial Real Estate when it flourishes (ie, post 1990). The
    next area of interest, Telecom, had a different risk profile, and so your team
    will probably be focused on poor Commercial Real Estate--i.e., past risk management
    success on the 'big themes' is not as relevant as it may seem.

  zh: 但是将风险管理者和业务线一样待遇的问题在于，风险管理是关于防止不太可能发生的事件，所以很难知道他们是否做得好。有人可能会说，这是一个很好的风险管理系统，但问题在于，在十年中有八年之内，一个好的和一个差的风险管理系统没有什么区别。然后，当周期确实崩溃时，你那支精通风险管理的团队阻止了1990年的商业房地产灾难，你会发现你的团队过于自信，并且在商业地产繁荣时（即1990年后）限制商业地产。下一个值得关注的领域是电信，具有不同的风险特征，所以你的团队可能会专注于糟糕的商业地产--即既往的风险管理成功对“大主题”并不像它看起来那么相关。
- en: Any job that is difficult to monitor with hard data, does not encourage excellence,
    or highly motivated, smart people, to go there, for the simple reason that, without
    objective metrics to assess performance, a huckster who focuses on irrelevancies
    looks too much like someone who focused like a laser on the essentials. Excellence
    is relatively unrewarded in risk management, so the excellent tend not to go there.
    Not that there are not many excellent people in risk management, merely that,
    on average, the business lines are better.

  zh: 任何工作，如果难以通过硬数据监测，就不鼓励优秀、积极主动、聪明的人才去做，因为没有客观的衡量绩效的指标，一个把注意力放在无关紧要事物上的骗子看起来和一个专注于要点的人太像了。优秀在风险管理中相对来说得不到奖励，所以优秀者不愿意去那里。并不是说风险管理中没有很多优秀的人，只是平均来说，业务线更好。
- en: A final point is that risk managers tend to be generalists, looking at a variety
    of businesses. For example, any risk manager with a modest amount of responsibility
    will be in charge of several very different products, like consumer and commercial
    loans. These loans have very different characteristics, as consumer loans tend
    to have high average charge off rates that very 2 or 3 fold over the cycle, where
    many commercial loan areas have near zero losses in good years, and 5 or 20% losses
    in bad years. The collateral is different, with different legal recourse when
    going after an individual’s assets versus a business where you often hold their
    property or inventory as collateral, leading to different recovery rates and timing.
    But this difference is true for really any level of detail. A loan to a Health
    Care provider would be very different than a loan to a hotel, even though they
    are both commercial’ loans. While there are common themes, such as standard financial
    ratios to examine, the key checklist of of bona fides vary by business line, and
    the business line managers tend to understand these nuances better than the generalist
    risk managers who independently evaluate them. Risk management is necessarily
    more big picture, and ignores many important line-specific information that materially
    affect a line’s prospects. Nonetheless, it’s value remains because of its independence.

  zh: 最后一点是，风险管理人员倾向于是多面手，关注各种业务。例如，任何负责一定责任范围的风险管理人员将负责几种非常不同的产品，比如消费者和商业贷款。这些贷款具有非常不同的特征，因为消费者贷款往往有着很高的平均核销率，在周期内会变化2到3倍，而许多商业贷款领域在好年份几乎没有损失，在坏年份有5到20%的损失。抵押品也不同，追索个人资产与追索企业资产有不同的法律救济途径，通常你持有他们的财产或库存作为抵押品，导致不同的回收率和时间。但这种差异对于任何细节层次都是真实的。对医疗保健提供商的贷款将与对酒店的贷款非常不同，即使它们都属于商业贷款。虽然有共同的主题，比如要检查的标准财务比率，但真正的可信清单因业务线而异，业务线经理倾向于比独立评估它们的多面手风险管理人员更好地理解这些微妙之处。风险管理必然更关注大局，忽视了许多重要的业务线特定信息，这些信息实际上极大地影响了业务线的前景。尽管如此，它的价值仍然存在，因为它的独立性。
- en: So you have ‘risk management’, whose value as an independent oversight is necessary
    to keep people honest, but they are generally not as smart or knowledgable as
    the business line they are monitoring. Their quality is difficult to evaluate
    directly, as the infrequency of the events they are avoiding makes it impossible
    to tie a bonus to, say, the avoidance of a large loss. Thus ‘risk management’
    professionals are more like audit than the business line, more rationalizers,
    and information reporting. Just as everyone says nice thing about police officers,
    but these people generally are not paid particularly well and they are generally
    not insanely bright, so it is with risk management.

  zh: 所以你有‘风险管理’，其作为独立监督的价值是必要的，以保持人们诚实，但他们通常并不像他们所监督的业务线那样聪明或知识丰富。他们的质量很难直接评估，因为他们所避免的事件的不经常发生使得不可能拿奖金来奖励，比如避免巨大损失。因此‘风险管理’专业人员更像审计而不是业务线，更像理性辩护者和信息报告者。就像每个人都对警察说好话一样，但这些人通常薪水不是特别高，他们通常也不是非常聪明，所以风险管理也是如此。
