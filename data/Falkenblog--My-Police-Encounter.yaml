- en: 'I remember having blown a bike tire in grad school I walked my bike tire to
    the bike shop across campus. I was an instructor at Northwestern at the time,
    and there were many bikes around campus and nearby, along with many bicycle thiefs
    (alas, my best bike ever was stolen there). Now, holding merely a bike tire looks
    suspicious because many bikes are locked up in a way that you can easily remove
    the tire. Anyway, cops saw me, and gave me the run-down: where was I going? where
    did I get the bike tire? where did I live? Where did I work? They called in all
    this information, and it took about 15 minutes to verify I was an instructor at
    the University. Finally I was allow on my merry way. There was no apology received,
    or asked. They weren''t mean, but they weren''t very nice either.'

  zh: 我记得研究生的时候自行车轮胎爆了，我推着自行车轮胎穿过校园到自行车店。当时我是西北大学的讲师，校园里和附近有很多自行车，也有很多自行车小偷（唉，我最好的自行车就是在那里被偷的）。现在，只拿着一个自行车轮胎看起来很可疑，因为很多自行车都是以你可以轻松卸下轮胎的方式锁起来的。不管怎样，警察看到我，对我进行了盘问：我要去哪里？轮胎是从哪里来的？我住在哪里？我在哪里工作？他们把所有这些信息都汇报了，大约花了15分钟核实我是大学的讲师。最后他们让我走了。没有收到道歉，也没有要求道歉。他们不算刻薄，但也不算友好。
- en: I've had several such run ins. I figure many cops are jerks because it appeals
    to people who like to boss others around. But it's an essential job, and if we
    had a bunch of sociologists or peace activists on the police force there would
    be anarchy, which only helps non-uniformed oppressors.

  zh: 我曾经遇到过好几次这样的冲突。我觉得很多警察都是混蛋，因为这种工作吸引了那些喜欢指挥别人的人。但这是一项必不可少的工作，如果我们的警察队伍中有一大堆社会学家或和平活动家，那就会是一片混乱，这只会帮助非制服压迫者。
- en: As someone who had liberal parents growing up in Southern California, I have
    never been racist, so I have no racial guilt. I think everyone should be treated
    the same, which is why I find these cases so repellent. Obama is not making these
    incidents go away, just as electing black mayors did not reduce the claims of
    racism in the cities where this occurred. I suspect many whites thought that by
    electing a black president, perhaps black/white relations in America will turn
    the corner, as the black community would see this as evidence that the white majority
    is not racist and assimilate like the Germans, Irish and Italians. I was born
    around a year after the Civil Rights Act was signed and my parents remember driving
    through the 1965 Watts riots to the hospital. As a child my parents were rather
    optimistic as if black/white would be like Lutheran/Methodist, a distinction without
    any resonance today. But things aren't getting better in general, and I'm not
    optimistic.

  zh: 作为在南加州长大的自由主义父母的孩子，我从未对种族怀有歧视，所以我没有种族内疚感。我认为每个人都应该被一视同仁，这就是为什么我觉得这些情况如此令人厌恶。奥巴马并没有让这些事件消失，就像选举黑人市长并没有减少在发生这些事件的城市中种族主义的说法一样。我怀疑很多白人认为通过选举黑人总统，也许美国的黑白关系会有所转变，就像黑人社区会把这视为白人多数不是种族主义者并像德国人、爱尔兰人和意大利人一样融入。我出生在《民权法案》签署后的一年左右，我的父母记得他们开着车穿过1965年的瓦特骚乱去医院。孩提时我的父母有些乐观，好像黑白之间的关系会像路德教徒和卫理公会教徒一样，这种区别今天已经没有任何共鸣。但总的来说事情并没有变得更好，我并不乐观。
