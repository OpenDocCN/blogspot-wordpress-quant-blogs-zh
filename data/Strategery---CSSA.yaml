     Don’t expect a repeat of such calls going forward.  These accidents of fortune
    occur more often than chance would suggest when you bet with historical probabilities.
    Still–the odds of being at the point of minimum adverse excursion are slim at
    best. I guess that is what hedge fund legend Jim Simons likes to talk about walking
    into work and hoping “he gets lucky.” Certainly I won’t have any reporters calling
    me up for future opinions.  So with that qualifier, I will present my own thoughts
    on developing an S&P500 intermediate term trading game plan for the present market
    conditions.  To borrow a caption from the last president–George Bush Jr. (whom
    I’m sure many now wish would be the president instead of Obama and his socialist
    parade) I would like to talk about “strategery.”

  zh: Ok，我承认——在上篇文章中对市场转折的预测确实有些幸运。请不要指望未来再次出现这样的预测。当你按照历史概率进行投注时，这种幸运的意外比机会更频繁地发生。然而——能够在最小不利行动点上的几率很小。我想这就是对冲基金传奇人物吉姆·西蒙斯喜欢谈论走进工作场所希望“他会有运气”的意思。当然，我不会有记者打电话来征求我的未来意见。所以，在此我要说明，我将提出我对目前市场状况下制定标准普尔500指数中期交易策略的想法。借用上一位总统乔治·布什（我相信很多人现在希望他是总统而不是奥巴马和他的社会主义阵营）的话，我想谈谈“战略”。
- en: 'Everyone is focused on what to do now, and really to me it comes down to creating
    an optimal strategy based on an assessment of the possible scenarios. Personally
    I think its obvious to say that the S&P500 is at a possible inflection point that
    will define 2010 and possibly 2011\. All of the trends are pointing down, yet
    at the same time the market is showing signs of life -finally- following a sizable
    pullback.  The 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving
    average–the so called “Death Cross” which ostensibly is an ominous sign. A good
    article  by Woodshedder on this long-term trend indicator and some stats worth
    reading through the various links: [http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-cross/](http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-cross/).
    I think that one key fact that I have found in a lot of my S&P500 research is
    that short trades have a much lower probability of being correct then long trades.
    This is especially true for longer-term trend systems. While some might argue
    that this is because the market has an upward bias over time (which is true) I
    also found that short trades worked poorly even in protracted bear markets. This
    is because of the increase in volatility that arises when the market goes down
    [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/where-fundamentals-affect-technicals-return-asymmetry-and-the-leverage-effect/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/where-fundamentals-affect-technicals-return-asymmetry-and-the-leverage-effect/).
    This increase in volatility and accelerated change in the return/risk dynamics
    makes explosive rallies in downtrends a fundamental reality. The basic implication
    is that you should take profits on shorts as conditions become increasingly oversold—such
    as when the RSI14<30.'

  zh: 每个人都在关注现在该做什么，对我来说，真正的关键在于根据可能的情景评估制定最佳策略。就个人而言，我认为明显的是，标准普尔500指数可能正处于一个能够定义2010年甚至2011年的拐点。所有趋势都指向下行，然而同时市场也显示出生机——终于——在一次相当大的回调之后。50日移动平均线最近已经跌破了200日移动平均线——所谓的“死亡交叉”，表面上是一个不祥的迹象。关于这一长期趋势指标的一篇好文章，以及一些值得阅读的统计数据，可以从这些链接中了解到：[http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-cross/](http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-death-cross/)。我认为我在很多标准普尔500指数研究中找到的一个关键事实是，短期交易的正确性远远低于长期交易。对于长期趋势系统，尤其如此。虽然有人可能争辩说这是因为市场随时间的推移具有上升的偏向（这是事实），但我也发现，即使在长时间的熊市中，短期交易的表现也很差。这是因为当市场下跌时，产生了波动率的增加[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/where-fundamentals-affect-technicals-return-asymmetry-and-the-leverage-effect/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/where-fundamentals-affect-technicals-return-asymmetry-and-the-leverage-effect/)。这种波动率的增加和收益/风险动态的加速变化使得在下降趋势中出现爆发性的反弹成为基本事实。基本含义是，当RSI14<30时，你应该在空头头寸获利。
- en: As a consequence, I would rate the odds of a sustained downward move as being
    low. Furthermore, if this new bounce is going to be the actual bottom of this
    swing-point, I would argue that ***the recent swing low (1010 on SPX) marks a
    significant support point that must be violated before a short trade should even
    be contemplated***. Given that most long-term short signals are unprofitable (over
    60%), it seems that getting short with evidence of strength coming off of deeply
    oversold conditions is probably the most common situation where trade losses often
    occur for the “Death Cross.” Seeing current support broken would “confirm” that
    this downtrend might actually have a chance to succeed. In this case, if  the
    short-term support was violated, it would be wise to think about a stop and reverse
    signal above the current swing high (1060 on SPX)-or the highest high that is
    achieved before an eventual pullback that violates support (at 1010 on SPX). Once
    again you will have the capacity to adjust your strategy  if “Mr. Market” decides
    to change his mind. Flexibility is key because the market is a crazy beast–especially
    these last few years.

  zh: 因此，我会给一个持续下跌的概率评一个低分。此外，如果这次新的反弹确实是这个摆动点的实际底部，我会认为**最近的摆动低点（标普指数的1010点）是一个重要的支撑点，在考虑做空之前必须被突破**。考虑到大多数长期做空信号都是亏损的（超过60%），在极度超卖的情况下出现强势反弹，很可能是“死亡交叉”交易亏损的最常见情况。如果当前的支撑被打破，这将“确认”这次下跌趋势可能真的有成功的机会。在这种情况下，如果短期支撑被突破，考虑到在达到当前摆动高点（标普指数的1060点）以上设置止损并反向交易——或者在最终回调突破支撑（标普指数的1010点）之前达到的最高点——将是明智的。如果“市场先生”决定改变主意，你将有能力调整你的策略。灵活性是关键，因为市场是一头疯狂的野兽——尤其是在过去这几年里。
- en: While my intermediate bias would be long, in the short-term however (read 1-3
    days) I would bet on a mild pullback due to overbought conditions. The two most
    likely outcomes in my opinion tommorow are the formation of a small up-bar with
    a narrow range, or a medium down bar with a medium range and a close slightly
    lower than today’s close. We may also see the market have a few small up-bars
    on weak volume before seeing a short-term pullback. In either case, the current
    point is not an idea spot to be adding to longs regardless of your outlook. It
    is best to wait for a short-term pullback to enter more units long or a new unit.
     One might place a stop 1/2 of an ATR unit below the low of today’s bar or the
    previous day’s bar.

  zh: 尽管我中期的看法是看涨，但短期内（读作1-3天）我会赌市场会出现温和回调，因为市场过热。在我看来，明天最有可能的两个结果是形成一个带有一个狭窄交易区间的小幅上涨柱，或者是一个带有中等交易区间并且收盘略低于今天收盘的中幅下跌柱。我们也可能看到市场在弱势成交量上出现几个小幅上涨柱之后出现短期回调。无论哪种情况，当前的位置都不是增加多头仓位的好地方，不管你的前景如何。最好等待一个短期回调以增持多头仓位或建立一个新的多头仓位。你可以将止损设置在今天柱状低点或前一天柱状低点下方半个ATR单位。
