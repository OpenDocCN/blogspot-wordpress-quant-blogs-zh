    report. The employment report is typically released on the first Friday of the
    month, though in some cases such as this month it occurs on a different day. This

    days. I found it was only the 10th time that the SPY has gapped down over 1% and
    failed to fill that opening gap. While I didn’t find the results significant,
    below I have listed the other 9 instances along with their 1-day returns.

- en: These results seem to imply a mild inclination towards further selling the next
    day. Another way that I looked at employment day gaps was by using a 200ma filter
    and eliminating the 1% size requirement. Overall the results of doing this didn’t
    suggest much. I did find it interesting though that there have been three instances
    since the March 2009 bottom and all three instances were followed by further declines
    ranging from 2.4% to 4.3% during the course of the following week. Those three
    instances occurred on 7/2/09, 8/6/10, and 6/3/11\.

- en: I don't believe either of these employment day studies is worth heavy consideration.
    My main take away is that the reaction to the employment report is not necessarily
    an overreaction. As the employment day results showed there does not appear to
    be an inclination for an immediate reversal. In fact, downside follow-through
    may be more likely.

  zh: 我不相信这些就业日研究中有任何值得深入考虑的。我的主要看法是，对就业报告的反应并不一定是过度反应。正如就业日结果所显示的，似乎没有立即反转的倾向。事实上，下跌跟进的可能性可能更大。
