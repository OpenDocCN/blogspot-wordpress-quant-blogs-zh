- en: Some conservatives and libertarians think that an Obama overreach will merely
    generate a backlash to an economy with less government. I'm not so sanguine. After
    all, the monopoly government has over education has never increased support for
    vouchers, rather, calls for increased funding to the same people that are screwing
    it up. Unlike business failures, which are abandoned, government failures merely
    ask for more money. A great take on this tendency is

  zh: 一些保守派和自由派认为，奥巴马的过度扩张只会导致对拥有更少政府的经济的强烈反弹。我没有那么乐观。毕竟，政府对教育的垄断从未增加支持教育券，而是呼吁增加资金以支持那些搞砸它的人。与企业失败不同的是，后者会被放弃，政府的失败只会要求更多的资金。对于这种倾向的伟大见解是

- en: with Duke University's Mike Munger about Santiago's bus system. What was once
    a private decentralized system with differing levels of quality and price was
    been transformed into a system of uniform quality designed from the top down.
    The private system had problems, as sometimes drivers would drive too fast to
    get passengers (in a race), but they made money. The new system does not make
    money. Instead of paying drivers by the number of customers they pick up, they
    pay them by the time they keep, so if they are late they don't stop for passengers.
    The commute times went way up, and the diversity of services--express buses for
    rich people, simpler buses for lower fares--went way down. Everyone gets the same
    service now. The result is quite ugly but there is no going back, politically
    it is very difficult to undo a nationalization.

  zh: 关于圣地亚哥公共汽车系统的节目，与杜克大学的迈克·门格尔一起。这个曾经是一个质量和价格各异的私人分散型系统，现已转变为一个由上而下设计的均匀质量的系统。私人系统出现问题，因为有时司机会开得太快来接乘客（比赛），但他们赚了钱。新系统不赚钱。他们不是根据司机接载的乘客计件工资，而是按他们保持时间支付工资，所以如果他们迟到了，就不会停下来接乘客。通勤时间大大增加，服务的多样性——富人乘坐的特快公交，为了更低票价服务的普通公交，大大减少。现在每个人都得到相同的服务。结果非常丑陋，但没有回头路，从政治上来说，很难撤销国有化。
- en: 'The scenario is very much like what I hear in modern public transit debates,
    where the thought that there are premium services, or services that skip the inner
    city, are taboo. So rich people don''t ride. Anything that does not discriminate
    becomes crap. The smart or rich ones see they are subsidizing the others, leaving
    only the poor and stupid as your customers, being served by a non-profit maximizing
    entity. The result is classic public service: public golf courses, public schools,
    public rest rooms--the contrast with ''private'' is night and day.'

  zh: 场景非常类似于我在现代公共交通辩论中所听到的，那里认为有高级服务或者越过市中心的服务是禁忌的。因此，富人不乘坐。任何不歧视的东西都变得糟糕。聪明或富有的人看到他们正在为其他人提供补贴，只剩下穷人和愚蠢的人成为你的客户，受到不追求盈利的实体的服务。结果是典型的公共服务：公共高尔夫球场，公共学校，公共洗手间——与“私有”形成鲜明对比。
- en: The new initiatives that are part of a stimulus package are permanent increases
    in the size of government, GS-14s with lots of rights until they retire, but little
    initiative, imagination, or incentives to get any. Oh well. I'm glad I wasn't
    born in Haiti, or in AD 1300.
