- en: my latest blog posting and my "return to blogland". I am happy that, after all
    of these months, some people are still reading this blog. It's difficult for me
    to watch all of the blogging from the sidelines, but as many of the readers here
    know, when I started my new job, I gave my word that I would reduce my blogging
    my 99%. And, since my daughter starts McGill University in the fall, I would like
    to be able to pay for her college education, even though McGill is half the cost
    of Carnegie Mellon (her other top choice).

  zh: 我最新的博客帖子以及我的“回到博客世界”。我很高兴，在这么多个月之后，还有一些人在阅读这个博客。对我来说，很难站在一旁观看所有的博客，但是正如这里的很多读者所知道的，当我开始新工作时，我发誓我会将我的博客减少到99%。而且，因为我的女儿在秋季开始麦吉尔大学，我想能够支付她的大学教育，尽管麦吉尔只有卡内基梅隆大学（她其他首选）的一半的费用。
- en: But, back to Opher's posting. Yes, there is a certain amount of stability when
    a large company purchases a small software manufacturer. For example, all of my
    concerns about the financial stability of a company like Coral8 would be assuaged
    by their takeover by Sybase. I do not know how much longer Coral8 and Aleri could
    have lasted given their revenue at the time of their purchase.

  zh: 但是，回到Opher的帖子。是的，当一个大公司收购一个小软件制造商时，会有一定程度的稳定性。例如，Sybase收购Coral8后，我对Coral8这样的公司财务稳定性的所有担忧都被消除了。我不知道Coral8和Aleri在被收购时的收入能撑多久。
- en: But, I used to like the fact that, if you needed questions answered about the
    internal architecture of the product or about the roadmap, you could usually get
    directly in touch with the CEO or CTO, and they would give you immediate answers,
    most often on a weekend. You would never get that same level of support from a
    Sybase, an IBM, or an Oracle.

  zh: 但是，我曾经喜欢这样的事实，如果你需要关于产品的内部架构或路线图的问题，你通常可以直接与CEO或CTO联系，他们会在周末时大多数时候立即回答你。你永远无法从Sybase、IBM或Oracle获得同样水平的支持。
- en: With a smaller company, you had more control over negotiating licensing costs
    and maintenance fees. They were anxious for your business. The cost of Coral8
    for a single core was $15K, and you could get a license for an 8 core machine
    for $120K (or, if you negotiated really hard, for $100K). I wonder what the current
    price for Coral8 under Sybase is now. I wonder if you could even purchase the
    legacy Coral8 product anymore, or whether it is wrapped up inside of Sybase RAP.

  zh: 对于一家规模较小的公司，你能更多地控制许可成本和维护费用的谈判。他们渴望得到你的业务。Coral8单核心的费用是$15K，你可以购买一台8核心机器的许可证，价格为$120K（或者，如果你谈判得很厉害，为$100K）。我想知道现在Sybase下Coral8的当前价格是多少。我想知道你是否还能购买传统的Coral8产品，或者它是否已经包含在Sybase
    RAP中。
- en: When I asked Coral8 or Aleri to come to a meeting at Citigroup, and to only
    show up with two people, they would agree and comply. When I asked IBM to come
    with 2 people when they demoed their CEP product to me, they showed up with about
    10 people, most of whom just sat their with their hands folded or took notes on
    everything I said. After they did this, I refused to take any more meetings with
    the IBM team on their CEP product, even though I had a few good email exchanges
    with some of their more technical people. Such is the arrogance and disregard
    for the (potential) custom that I have often found with a very large company.

  zh: 当我要求Coral8或Aleri在花旗集团开会，并且只带两个人过来时，他们会答应并遵守。当我要求IBM在演示他们的CEP产品时只带2个人来，他们带来了大约10个人，其中大多数人只是坐在那里双手交叉或记下我说的一切。他们这样做之后，我拒绝再与IBM团队就他们的CEP产品进行任何会议，尽管我与一些技术人员有一些良好的电子邮件交流。这就是我在一个非常大的公司中经常发现的傲慢和对（潜在的）客户的漠视。
- en: Many times, when a small and innovative company gets bought by a mega company,
    you lose the two most important things that the small company has to offer ....
    the people and the innovate-or-die attitude. You most certainly lose the small-town,
    personal touch that the company gives you. On that note, a fond goodbye to the
    guy with the most infectious laugh in the industry, Jon Reicke, who is now making
    people laugh at Google in New York.

  zh: 很多时候，一家小型的创新型公司被一家大型公司收购后，你会失去这家小公司最提供的两件最重要的事情……就是人和创新至上的态度。你肯定会失去公司给予你的那种小镇，个人化的触感。说到此，向这个行业里最具感染力的笑声告别，乔恩·莱克（Jon
    Reicke），他现在在纽约的谷歌让那里的人们开怀大笑。
- en: I certainly hope that Panopticon, one of the last of the good guys, does not
    get swallowed up by Sybase, but I am not hopeful. But in the rush for consolidation,
    this would not surprise me at all.
