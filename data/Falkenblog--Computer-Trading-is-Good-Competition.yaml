    generations, specialists would sit on trades for minutes, not milliseconds, while
    they decided how to maximize their profits. I know one guy who worked for a specialist
    around 2000, and he noted his boss lost money only a handful of days every year.
    Specialists would emphasize the risk they took in providing liquidity, yet on

    implement relative value trades. The famous pairs trading, where if Pepsi rises,
    but Coke stays flat, you sell Pepsi and buy coke, is based on this idea. But it
    can be generalized to indices versus sectors, or baskets against each other based
    on statistical properties, or even oil futures vs. Exxon. Lastly, there are the
    market making algorithms that try to capture the spread in the market by correctly
    anticipating the future distribution of retail order flow based on the current
    book, and this strategy can complement a relative value trading algorithm. Many
    times these algorithms try to reverse engineer future trades via the way current
    trades are coming in. As many trades come in each second, for many stocks the
    best bids and offers are adjusted several times a second.

- en: One article noted that some algorithms basically infer the price increase from
    trades, getting rid of the profits otherwise available. But these are all short
    term scenarios, and basically make a market efficient. That is, say Apple announces
    good news, suggesting a sharpe bounce in the stock. An investor tries to buy,
    and would like to trade 1MM shares, but clearly that's too much, so he puts in
    an order for 1000, then next minute, another 1000, and another. A machine might
    sense the pattern and basically jump on for the ride with him, diluting his profits.
    Is that bad news? Only for the short-term trader. For the longer run investor
    oblivious to this, who was on the other side, they got to sell at a higher price
    (the price rose faster than otherwise). The short-term speculator basically makes
    less because the algorithm reverse engineers his insight. This is the essence
    of an informationally efficient market, where news gets into the price asap. That
    those at the bleeding edge are making a profit is not a bug, it's a feature.

    100 万股，但显然这太多了，所以他先下了 1000 股的订单，然后下一分钟再下 1000 股，再下 1000 股。一台机器可能会察觉到这种模式，并基本上跟着他一起行动，稀释了他的利润。这是坏消息吗？只对短期交易者而言。对于对此不知情的长期投资者来说，这是好消息，因为他们可以以更高的价格卖出（价格比其他情况下上涨得更快）。短期投机者的利润基本上会减少，因为算法反向工程了他的见解。这就是信息效率市场的本质，即新闻会尽快反映在价格中。那些处于尖端的人赚取利润并不是一个故障，而是一种特征。

    Normally this would upset me, but they have an option lasting only 30 milliseconds
    (30 thousandths of a second). For a computer, this is enough time to make a decision.
    This is certainly enough time to make a tenth of a cent or so on market orders
    by leaning on the existing book. That is, if the market is bid-ask at 10.03-05,
    with 100 shares on each, a market order to buy 100 shares might make you hit the
    offer at 10.05 because you know there is 100 shares following you, and you hope
    the price increases based on this flow. This is known as 'front running'. Or you
    might see more buying coming in at a limit price of 10.02, and decide to increase
    your bid at 10.03 because you know your downside is now limited to a penny, as
    you can sell at 10.02 in size. This is known as pennying a bid, because you basically
    use the other person's limit orders as a backstop, giving you a penny downside
    risk. As tendencies move probabilistically, on any one trade such shenanigans
    are worth much less than a penny, but it can add up for the one doing it. For
    your average investor, in contrast, it is totally irrelevant. In the context of
    buying a $20 stock, does the fact that a highly competitive group can make tenths
    of a cent on market transactions bother me? No. It is orders of magnitude lower
    than 10 years ago, which is orders of magnitude lower than 30 years ago. Commissions
    for most investors are at least a penny. Of all the financial skullduggery in

    毫秒）。对于计算机来说，这足够时间做出决定。这肯定足够时间在市场订单上赚取十分之一的分钱左右，通过依靠现有的订单簿。也就是说，如果市场的买卖盘为 10.03-05，每边有
    100 股，市价买入 100 股的订单可能会以 10.05 的价格成交，因为你知道你后面还有 100 股，而你希望价格根据这个流量上涨。这被称为‘前瞻性交易’。或者你可能会看到更多的买盘以
    10.02 的限价进来，然后决定将你的买价提高到 10.03，因为你知道你的下跌风险现在被限制在一分钱，因为你可以以 10.02 的价格卖出一定数量。这被称为‘挖一分钱的买价’，因为你基本上是利用对方的限价订单作为保护壁垒，给自己一个一分钱的下跌风险。随着趋势以概率方式移动，对于任何一笔交易，这样的花招的价值远低于一分钱，但对于做这种交易的人来说，这些价值可以积少成多。对于普通投资者来说，相比之下，这完全无关紧要。在购买一支
    $20 的股票的情况下，一个高度竞争的团体能在市场交易中赚取十分之一的分钱，这会让我感到不安吗？不会。它比 10 年前低了数个数量级，比 30 年前低了数个数量级。对于大多数投资者来说，佣金至少是一分钱。在今天世界上所有金融欺诈中，闪电交易前瞻交易的价值只相当于小麦酒。
