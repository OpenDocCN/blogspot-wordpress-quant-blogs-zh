- en: The market has been on a wild ride overnight since the election. It seemed as
    if Mr. Market couldn't decide if another four years of the Obama Administration
    was good or bad. Initially, ES futures sold off hard as the polls closed and Obama
    gained ground on Romney. It then rallied soon after Obama was declared the victor
    and the  USD weakened against most currencies. Most Asian and European bourses rose
    overnight. As the markets are poised to open on Wednesday, ES futures are deeply
    in the red and the USD has regained a bid.

  zh: 自选举以来，市场经历了一夜的剧烈波动。似乎市场先生无法决定奥巴马政府再续四年是好事还是坏事。最初，随着投票关闭，ES期货暴跌，奥巴马在 Romney 上取得领先。随后，在奥巴马被宣布为胜者后不久，市场反弹，美元对大多数货币走软。大部分亚洲和欧洲股市隔夜上涨。随着市场在周三开盘，ES期货跌幅较大，美元重新获得买盘。

    representing equities and the risk-on trade, against TLT, representing long Treasuries
    and the risk-off trade, is forming a wedge - a sign of indecision for technicians.

    it will typically break hard in the direction of the break.
