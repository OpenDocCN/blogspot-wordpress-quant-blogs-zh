- en: Perhaps it is just a coincidence that the “Oil VIX” appeared on the scene just
    as the implied volatility in oil futures (or at least as captured by [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO))
    was hitting an eight month high.  The “Oil VIX” (formally known as the CBOE Crude
    Oil Volatility Index; ticker [OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OVX))
    and crude oil may get the lion’s share of the energy headlines, but lately it
    has been natural gas that has been making the more dramatic moves.

  zh: 也许只是一个巧合，“石油VIX”恰好在石油期货的隐含波动率（至少是被[USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO)捕捉到的）达到八个月高点时出现在市场上。
    “石油VIX”（正式名称为CBOE原油波动率指数；股票代码[OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OVX)）和原油可能会占据能源新闻的大部分篇幅，但最近是天然气做出了更加剧烈的波动。
- en: A look at the three month chart of [UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG)
    (the natural gas ETF that is the counterpart to USO), courtesy of the ISE, shows
    implied volatility steadily increasing over the past five weeks, with the gap
    between implied volatility and historical volatility continuing to widen – all
    while natural gas has pulled back about 27%.

  zh: 通过ISE提供的[UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG)（天然气的ETF，USO的对冲基金）的三个月图表显示，过去五周内隐含波动率稳步上升，隐含波动率与历史波动率之间的差距继续扩大——而在此期间天然气回调了约27%。
- en: Natural gas implied volatility levels are higher than oil implied volatility
    levels at the moment, and the pullback in natural gas presents some interesting
    trading opportunities.  Some momentum players are already short here and some
    value hunters are buying on weakness, particularly if they believe in the long-term
    commodity bull and other supply and demand issues that are specific to natural
    gas.

  zh: 当前，天然气的隐含波动率高于石油的隐含波动率，而天然气的回调带来了一些有趣的交易机会。一些趋势玩家已经在此处做空，一些价值猎手在弱势时买入，特别是如果他们相信长期的大宗商品牛市以及其他与天然气特定的供需问题。
- en: The case for natural gas trading sideways from current levels is hard to make.  Directional
    bets are expensive, due to high IV.  Two trades I am looking hard at, with a bullish
    directional bias, are [bull put spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20put%20spread)
    and [call backspreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/call%20backspread).  The
    former limits upside and downside; the latter is more aggressive and more risky.

  zh: 从当前水平来看，天然气交易横盘的案例很难成立。由于高波动率，方向性投注变得昂贵。我正在认真研究两种具有看涨方向偏好的交易，分别是[看涨看跌期权价差](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20put%20spread)和[看涨期权备兑价差](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/call%20backspread)。前者限制了上下行空间；后者更为激进，风险也更高。
