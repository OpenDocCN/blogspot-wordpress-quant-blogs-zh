    post that it seems appropriate to launch a follow-up post to address several questions
    raised or implied by readers. The biggest issues seemed to revolve around the
    history, performance and holdings of these ETFs. It is also important to understand
    the nature of the index and/or strategy that the ETF seeks to replicate, as well
    as the timing and methodology used to rebalance the ETFs. For each of the six
    aforementioned strategy-in-a-box ETFs, I have therefore also included links to
    a profile/summary page; the prospectus; a current list of holdings; the Morningstar
    performance data; and the StockCharts gallery chart:'

  zh: 我对我的[策略盒ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Strategy-in-a-Box%20ETFs)文章的反馈感到非常满意，因此似乎适宜推出一篇后续文章来回答读者提出或暗示的几个问题。最大的问题似乎围绕着这些ETFs的历史、表现和持仓情况。了解ETF试图复制的指数和/或策略的性质，以及ETF调仓的时间和方法也同样重要。因此，我为上述六种策略盒ETFs也包括了链接到其概要页面；招募说明书；当前持仓列表；晨星绩效数据；以及股票图表库图表：
- en: As noted on Sunday, all but LSC have at least two years of a track record. Normally
    I would not consider this to be a long time, but given that it covers both strong
    bull and bear markets, I believe it is an appropriate time period from which to
    draw some conclusions. Perhaps more interesting is the rebalance period, where
    quarterly rebalancing seems to be the norm. I have spent a fair amount of time
    playing with various rebalancing methods and at least in my experience, I find
    it difficult to gain a meaningful edge with quarterly rebalancing.

  zh: 正如周日所提到的，除了LSC，其他所有ETFs都至少有两年以上的跟踪记录。通常我不会认为这算长，但由于它涵盖了强烈的牛市和熊市，我认为这是一个可以从中得出一些结论的适当时间周期。也许更有趣的是调仓周期，其中季度调仓似乎是常态。我在各种调仓方法上花了不少时间，至少在我的经验中，我发现每季度调仓难以获得实质性优势。
- en: Finally, it looks as if the strategy-in-a-box moniker is here to stay. I guess
    it is just a matter of time before I roll out screw top, synthetic cork and real
    cork strategies. Perhaps then we can turn our attention to the next dimension,
    Jeroboam, Methuselah and Nebuchadnezzar strategies…

  zh: 最后，看起来“策略盒”这个名称是准备长期存在了。我猜只是时间问题，我就会推出螺旋盖、合成软木和真实软木的策略。也许那时我们可以将注意力转向下一个维度，雅罗巴姆、米所波大米和尼布甲尼撒的策略…
