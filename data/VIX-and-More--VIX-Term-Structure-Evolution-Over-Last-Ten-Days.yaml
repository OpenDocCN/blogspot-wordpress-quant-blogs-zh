- en: If you think the last two weeks have turned the investing world upside down,
    well you have to look no farther than the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    to see just how accurate that view is. Two weeks ago the VIX was in the 17s and
    the VIX futures term structure was in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (upward sloping) and today the VIX closed at 32 and the VIX futures term structure
    is in [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation).
    In fact, the current VIX term structure looks a lot like a mirror image of what
    it was two weeks ago.

  zh: 如果你认为过去两周已经将投资世界颠倒过来，那么你只需要看看[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)就可以看出这一观点是多么准确。两周前，VIX在17点左右，而VIX期货期限结构处于[顺差](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)（向上倾斜），而今天，VIX收盘在32点，VIX期货期限结构处于[反转](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)。事实上，当前的VIX期限结构看起来非常像两周前的镜像。
- en: In the graphic below, I have detailed the shift in the term structure from July
    22^(nd) to today’s close. During that period, the S&P 500 index has sold off 10.8%,
    while the VIX has spiked 82.6%. Note that the front month (August) VIX futures
    have advanced sharply – up 59% during this period – but not as sharply as the
    VIX. Looking at the back end of the term structure, the March 2012 futures were
    not traded back on July 22^(nd), so the February futures are the most distant
    futures for which we can compare prices. Their move lagged the VIX and front month
    futures by a large margin and was almost identical in magnitude to that of the
    SPX, up 10.7% in those two weeks. One can clearly see from the funnel formed by
    the two term structure lines that for each month farther out in the term structure,
    the VIX futures were less responsive to the move in the SPX or the VIX.

  zh: 在下面的图表中，我详细说明了从7月22日到今天收盘时期限结构的变化。在这段期间，标普500指数下跌了10.8%，而VIX飙升了82.6%。请注意，前端月份（8月）的VIX期货大幅上涨，此期间上涨了59%——但不及VIX上涨得厉害。观察期限结构的后端，2012年3月的期货在7月22日没有交易，因此2月期货是我们可以比较价格的最远期货。它们的走势大幅落后于VIX和前端期货，并且在这两周内的涨幅几乎与SPX相同，上涨了10.7%。可以清楚地看到，从期限结构线所形成的漏斗中可以看出，对于结构中每个月来说，VIX期货对于SPX或VIX的变动反应较弱。
- en: In addition to annotating the backwardation and contango in the graphic, I have
    also circled the December VIX futures and options expiration (December 21^(st))
    in an effort to preempt some questions about why these futures seem unusually
    low both now and two weeks ago. The simple answer is the preponderance of holidays
    toward the end of the year, with fewer trading days translating into fewer opportunities
    for extended moves in volatility. I have discussed this phenomenon many times
    in the past (see [VIX and the Week Before Christmas](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-second-half-of-december.html),
    for starters) and have named it the “[holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)”
    or “[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion).”
    Also note that December has a history of being relatively bullish for stocks,
    with low volatility.

  zh: 除了在图表中注释反转和顺差外，我还圈出了12月VIX期货和期权到期日（12月21日），以预防一些关于为什么这些期货现在和两周前看起来异常低的问题。简单的答案是年底假期较多，交易日较少，这意味着波动率的扩大机会较少。我之前多次讨论过这种现象（首先请参阅[VIX和圣诞节前一周](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-second-half-of-december.html)），并将其命名为“[假日效应](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)”或“[日历逆转](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)”。“还要注意，12月份股票相对而言历史上表现相对牛市，波动性较低。
- en: Finally, I have fielded quite a few questions about the implications of yesterday’s
    35.4% [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes). Here
    some prior research on the [Short-Term and Long-Term Implications of the 30% VIX
    Spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/04/short-term-and-long-term-implications.html)
    will undoubtedly be of interest to most readers. The quick takeaway is that this
    event is bullish for stocks and bearish for volatility. I would expect to see
    more evidence of this fact beginning to kick in on Monday.

  zh: 最后，我收到了不少关于昨天35.4%的[VIX激增](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)的影响的问题。这里有一些关于[30%
    VIX激增的短期和长期影响](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/04/short-term-and-long-term-implications.html)的先前研究，无疑会引起大多数读者的兴趣。简单来说，这一事件对股市是利好的，对波动性是利空的。我预计这一事实将在周一开始显现更多证据。
