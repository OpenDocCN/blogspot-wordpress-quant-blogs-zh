    Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought them at. Most of the time, the public
    finds out in regulatory filings after the fact and the stocks have already moved
    up. Here is one exception that I discovered.

    same price as Buffet bought his stake.

    the more conservatively capitalized companies in the Canadian oil patch. The dividend
    yield is just slightly north of 3%.

    negative the feedback is. So please, either comment at the end of this post, email
    me at cam at hbhinvestments dot com or tweet me at @humblestudent. Tell me what
    a stupid idea this is, how SU is a value trap and what an idiot Warren Buffett
    is to be holding energy stocks when it was obvious that oil prices would be tanking.
