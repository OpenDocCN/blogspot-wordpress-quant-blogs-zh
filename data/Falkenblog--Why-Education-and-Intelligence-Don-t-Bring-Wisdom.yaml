- en: It's always fun to watch partisans spin data into supporting their bigger point,
    because often, it is unnecessary. The fact that Hitler was nice to dogs and children,
    is not a paradox--it needs no explaining--because people have many qualities,
    and no one is pure good or bad, regardless of their net goodness or badness. Thus
    watching partisans selectively apply reasoning, even when totally unnecessary.
    If you like McCain, you note the experience of McCain compared to Obama. If you
    like Obama, you think the limited experience of the Vice Presidential candidate
    is very important. Inevitably you will be contradicting yourself in short order.
    Nevertheless, one feels obligated to put every datapoint into a supporting role,
    as if no evidence can be mitigating or irrelevant.

  zh: 观察党派支持者将数据扭曲成支持他们的大点通常很有趣，因为通常情况下，这是没必要的。希特勒对狗和孩子友好这个事实，不是一个似是而非的现象--不需要解释--因为人有许多品质，没人是纯善或纯恶，不管他们的总体善或恶的净值如何。因此，观察党派支持者有选择性地运用推理，即使是完全没必要的。如果你喜欢麦凯恩，你会注意麦凯恩相对奥巴马的经验。如果你喜欢奥巴马，你会认为副总统候选人的有限经验非常重要。你终将前言不搭后语。然而，你会感到有义务将每个数据点放在支持角色中，仿佛没有证据可以减轻或无关紧要。

    then confabulate answers. He notes an experiment where people whose brain's corpus
    collosum has been severed, are shown pictures so that a chicken claw is seen by
    the language portion of the brain, a car stuck in snow is shown to the visual
    side. These same two sides correspond to controlling the right hand, and left
    hand, respectively. He would ask the subjects to point to the object that 'goes
    with' what he saw. The right hand pointed to a chicken, the left hand would point
    to a shovel. Asked 'why' his left hand pointed to a shovel, he (his language side)
    would say 'Oh, that's easy. the chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need
    a shovel to clean out the chicken shed', as his language side responded. This
    is a pure confabulation, a rationalization, and it is done unconsciously. The
    smarter you are, the better your confabulations will be. Your consciousness, and
    all the rhetoric it can muster, is like a hired lawyer tendentiously arguing for
    decisions your unconsciousness makes for its own reasons.

    He thinks government can usually make things better in a variety of ways, and
    improve upon the messiness of markets almost always, in that same way a traffic
    light improves upon a cross-section without one. The government's advantage, in
    Stiglitz's mind, is that it is disinterested, and has the greater good in mind,
    whereas the market is just a bunch of selfish, often quite stupid, individuals.
    People who believe in free markets, in his view, are doctrinaire ideologues, whereas
    he sees what is true. That his proofs of inefficiency totally do not address the
    efficiency of regulation in general, or mention any regulation in specific, is
    unimportant. He just highlights the inefficiency of a free market under certain
    assumptions, and satisfies himself that he is proving his point. It helps his
    point, but is generally insufficient. When one things of the long gestation of
    the effect of the Clinton tax on 'millionaires' in 1993, and how this encouraged
    more CEO stock options, and the effect this had on the internet bubble six years
    later; or how S&L regulation in 1978 and 1982 created the S&L crisis six years
    later; or how encouraging home ownership via more lax underwriting helped create
    the subprime crisis a couple years later, highlights that the government's attempts
    to redress market inadequacies is very tricky, sowing the seeds for things few
    people anticipate, at great cost.

  zh: 认为市场是低效的，这一直是他一生的主题。他认为政府通常可以以各种方式使事情变得更好，并且几乎总是能够改进市场的混乱，就像交通灯改善了没有交通灯的十字路口一样。在斯蒂格利茨看来，政府的优势在于它是公正的，并且考虑到更大的利益，而市场只是一群自私的，经常相当愚蠢的个人。在他看来，相信自由市场的人是教条主义的理念家，而他看到的才是真相。他的佐证中完全没有涉及一般监管的效率，也没有提到任何具体的监管，这是不重要的。他只是强调了在某些假设下自由市场的低效，让他满足于证明自己的观点。这有助于他的观点，但通常是不够的。当人们考虑到克林顿1993年对“百万富翁”税的长期影响，以及这如何促进了更多CEO股票期权，以及六年后这对互联网泡沫的影响；或者1978年和1982年S&L监管如何在六年后制造了S&L危机；或者更宽松的贷款审核如何帮助导致了几年后的次级信贷危机，就会突显出政府试图弥补市场不足是非常棘手的，以巨大的代价引发了人们很少预料到的事情。

    my lack of intellectual stimulation. Good ideas are freely available via books,
    journals, and the web. Further, I do not have a thread of published papers that
    constrains my views, in that once a series of papers is published, there is a
    large incentive to defending the deeper theme to these papers to keep them relevant,
    and we unconsciously spin our interpretation of the world in support of these
    ideas until we die (eg, did Noam Chomsky learn anything from the fall of the Berlin
