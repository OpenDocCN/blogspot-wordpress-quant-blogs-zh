    Also, while the last two firms don't break out income attributable to CDS activities
    (at least not that I could find), B of A made a huge portion of their profits
    in 2010 from them. (Note that Citi did not indicate how much of the CDS protection

    to be plausibly consistent with the BIS estimate of about $100 bn in indirect
    exposures to peripheral Europe. If you add up the highlighted numbers (and make
    a guess at Citi's position), it seems reasonable to guess that the total net open
    positions on CDS protection sold to third parties by the big US banks is between
    $1,500 and $2,000billion. Attributing $35 bn of that (about 2%) to Greece, which
    has certainly had one of the most active markets (proportionally) for CDS contracts
    over the past year, doesn't seem to be a stretch.
