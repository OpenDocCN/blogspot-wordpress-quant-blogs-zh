    turkey farm over the weekend put bird flu stocks back in the spotlight once again.  Over
    the past two years, most of us have become largely desensitized to the possibility
    of a widespread bird flu outbreak, as each incident has spawned a less and less
    strident media frenzy.  In a sense, the same soft of desensitization has set in
    over the past year or two with bird flu, terrorism, $100/bbl. oil, Iraq/Iran,
    <country-region st="on"><place st="on">North Korea</place></country-region>, etc.  The
    media has a field day for awhile, but as the panic level subsides for a second
    or third time, the public sees these as more [cry wolf](http://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html)
    exercises and makes a mental note to ignore future scare tactics and, in many
    cases, completely tune out the entire issue.'

- en: Is this why the VIX has now made 33 consecutive new lows for the 100 day SMA?  Perhaps
    it is not so much complacency that has set in as mass desensitization.

- en: 'Back to bird flu stocks.  Their price movement has a strong fear component
    in them and as such, they are part of the VIX [taxonomy of fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/on-nature-of-fear.html)
    (which I will someday formalize as the *VIXdex*.)  It should come as no surprise,
    then, that bird flu stocks have characteristics that are similar to that of the
    VIX.  Specifically, they tend to spike up sharply, then subside over time, with
    [patterns](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html)
    of 1 and 3-5 day spikes being relatively common.  Some of this can be seen in
    the BCRX daily chart, where the Williams %R and CCI are showing that four days
    into the move up, we have a good shorting opportunity:'

  zh: 回到禽流感股票的话题。它们的股价波动中包含着强烈的恐慌成分，因此它们是VIX[恐惧分类](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/on-nature-of-fear.html)（我将来会将其正式化为*VIXdex*）的一部分。因此，禽流感股票具有与VIX相似的特征也就不足为奇了。具体来说，它们倾向于急剧上涨，然后随着时间的推移而回落，1天和3-5天上涨的模式相对常见。一些这种情况可以在BCRX的日线图上看到，在那里，威廉姆斯%R和CCI显示，在上涨四天后，我们有一个很好的做空机会：
