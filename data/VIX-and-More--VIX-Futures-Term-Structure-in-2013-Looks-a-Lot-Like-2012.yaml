- en: This was a very quiet year for the VIX, with the volatility index posting its
    second narrowest range for the year since 1995, trailing only 2005, when the Greenspan
    liquidity flood overwhelmed even the mere thought of a meaningful correction.

    for each year since the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    were launched, back in 2004\. In normalizing the data, I have set the average
    front month VIX futures contract to 100 and have expressed the averages of the
    second through seven months as multiples of the front month.

- en: Note that although the VIX futures were launched in 2004, consecutive VIX futures
    contracts for the first six months were not available until October 2006, hence
    the dotted lines for these years to reflect the erratic nature of the data. Interestingly,
    the lower VIX years of 2005 and 2006 did not produce the steep term structure
    that we saw in 2012 and saw again in 2013\. Last year I [described](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-2012-vix-futures-term-structure-as.html)
    the 2012 VIX futures term structure as a statistical outlier, but now that 2013
    data is in the books, it may be more appropriate to think about how the markets
    might have changed in the last two years, with potential causes that range from
    the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN), more interest
    in trading volatility products, the rise of [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weeklys)
    and other developments.

    volatility and related data for 2013, then as 2014 unfolds I will offer some thoughts
    on how some of these markets are changing and evolving.

    that I have my investment management business up and running and find it easier
    to wear multiple hats at the same time.
