    had a 15% loss in income, and live in their mortgaged property. As part of a $1B
    national program, 1500 lucky Minnesotans will receive a $50k no-interest loan
    after filling out a bunch of paperwork, and they don't have to pay it back at
    all if they then live in that home for 5 years.

  zh: 该计划的目标是针对在3个月内未偿还抵押贷款，收入减少15%，并且居住在抵押房产中的借款人。作为一个10亿美元的全国性计划的一部分，1500名幸运的明尼苏达人在填写一堆文件后将获得一笔5万美元的无息贷款，如果他们继续居住在那个家5年，就不必偿还这笔贷款。
- en: This seems to have all the wrong incentives. Why pay on your mortgage if you
    have had a decline in income given this carrot? In lending, ability and willingness
    to pay are key variables, and it seems government is doing everything it can to
    make people believe those who pay are suckers. As traditional lending then dries
    up, leaving only FHA lending, the housing market remains depressed. Further, most
    people who don't pay will just make it harder for them to get loans in the future
    and won't receive the windfall, as it is decided via a lottery.

  zh: 这似乎有了所有错误的激励机制。在这种情况下，为什么要还抵押贷款，如果你的收入有所下降呢？在借贷中，偿还能力和意愿是关键变量，看来政府正在尽一切努力让人们相信那些还款的人是傻瓜。随着传统的贷款逐渐枯竭，只剩下FHA贷款，房屋市场仍然处于低迷。此外，大多数不还贷款的人只会让他们未来更难获得贷款，也不会获得这笔意外之财，因为这是通过抽奖决定的。
- en: Recessions are bad things, but the key is that people need to find new lines
    of work where their services are needed, that will pay them what they think is
    their best wage. These programs simply slow this process down, as people hold
    out for the latest government give-away that encourages having lower income. Further,
    most people won't receive aid, so luring them into this complacency just makes
    them less motivated and ultimately poorer.

  zh: 经济衰退是一个坏事，但关键是人们需要找到自己服务所需的新职业，这将给他们带来他们认为是最好工资。这些计划简单地放慢了这个过程，因为人们期待着最新的鼓励低收入的政府派发的福利。此外，大多数人将不会获得援助，所以吸引他们进入这种自满只会让他们变得不太积极，最终更穷。
