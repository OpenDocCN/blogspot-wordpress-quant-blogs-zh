    and also random trends in geology in species distributions. One thing most people
    understand is that trying to make an ecosystem better is really, really hard,
    because everything is connected in complex ways, and not obvious what 'better'
    means.

- en: For example, before the middle of the 20th century most forest managers believed
    that fires should be suppressed at all times. By 1935, the U.S. Forest Service's
    fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by
    10 A.M. the morning after they were first spotted. Early posters of Smokey Bear
    misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused.
    In Yellowstone park human-caused fires average about 8 annually, while about 35
    wildfires are ignited by lightning. Fire is a natural process, and helps clean
    out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree
    species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Scientists knew a little
    about that, so starting in 1972 the National Park Service began allowing natural
    fires in Yellowstone to burn under controlled conditions, yet of a total of 235
    prescribed natural fires burned under the directives of the new policy, only 15
    spread to more than 100 acres. With all that kindling, in 1988, a total of 793,880

  zh: 例如，在20世纪中叶之前，大多数森林管理者认为火灾应该始终被扑灭。到了1935年，美国林务局的火灾管理政策规定，所有的野火都必须在第一次发现后的早上10点前扑灭。《Smokey熊》的早期海报误导了公众认为西部的山火主要是人为引起的。在黄石公园，人为引起的火灾平均每年约有8起，而闪电引发的火灾约有35起。火灾是一种自然过程，有助于清除林下植被和死植物物质，使经济上重要的树木种类能够在更少的养分竞争下生长。科学家们对此了解不多，所以从1972年开始，国家公园管理局开始允许黄石公园内的自然火灾在受控条件下燃烧，然而在新政策的指导下总共有235起规定的自然火灾，只有15起蔓延到了100英亩以上。有了所有这些易燃物，到了1988年，总计793,880英亩（3,213平方公里）的面积，即36%的

    Solving for these three objectives simultaneously is harder than the three-body

    a housing-led revival to the economy.” The Treasury will have a new plan announced
    in January, but they have a tiger by the tale. One thing the government does not
    do well is price for risk, and as Joe Stiglitz knows, this leads to pooling equilibria,
    where good and bad risks are priced the same. In such events, the good credits
    leave because they don't like subsidizing their free-riding brethren, so its a
    race to the bottom that eventually blows us (i.e., it's not an equilibrium). So,
