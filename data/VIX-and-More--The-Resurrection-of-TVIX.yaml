- en: It has been quite a year for [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX),
    formally known as the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN. At the beginning
    of 2012, TVIX was trading about a million shares per day and was known to only
    a small group of investors that followed the [VIX exchanged-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    space. By the middle of February, however, volume in TVIX had soared to 40 million
    shares, making it the volume leader in the VIX ETP space. It seemed as if TVIX
    had made the jump from relative obscurity to headline-grabbing rock star status
    with stunning swiftness and almost no effort.

  zh: 2012年对TVIX来说是非常的一年，它正式被称为VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN。年初时，TVIX每天的交易量约为一百万股，只被少数关注[VIX交易所交易产品](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)空间的投资者所知。然而，到了2月中旬，TVIX的交易量激增至四千万股，成为VIX
    ETP领域的成交量领导者。似乎TVIX以惊人的速度和几乎不费吹灰之力的方式，从相对默默无闻一跃成为引人注目的摇滚明星。
- en: TVIX soon became a victim of its own success, a fact which was confirmed when
    Credit Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) [announced](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)
    on February 21^(st) that it had “temporarily suspended further issuances of the
    VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETNs ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX))
    due to internal limits on the size of the ETNs.” I covered [this story](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)
    and the subsequent fallout in depth and will not repeat the particulars here (see
    links below for more information) other than to note that the absence of a supply
    of new creation units led to a substantial imbalance between supply and demand,
    with the result that the price of TVIX soared relative to its [Intraday Indicative
    Value](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)
    (a real-time estimate of an ETP’s fair value, based on the most recent prices
    of its underlying securities) and became almost completely unhinged from any reasonable
    estimate of fair value. The extreme price dislocation persisted for a little over
    a month, until Credit Suisse [agreed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/tvix-creation-units-return-what-it.html)
    to reopen the issuance of creation units “on a limited basis” on March 22^(nd).
    To make a long story short, the price collapsed by more than 50% in two days in
    the wake of this announcement (see the gap down in the chart below), many investors
    suffered huge losses and a slew of law suits were not far behind.

  zh: TVIX很快成为了自己成功的牺牲品，这一事实在2月21日瑞士信贷（[CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)）[宣布](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)暂停发行VelocityShares
    Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETNs ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX))之后得到了确认，原因是ETNs的内部规模限制。我深入报道了[这个故事](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)及其后果，并且不会在这里重复具体细节（更多详情请查看下面的链接），只是要注意新创设单位的缺失导致了供需之间的巨大不平衡，结果TVIX的价格相对于其[盘中参考价值](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)（基于其基础证券最近价格的实时估计的ETP的公允价值）大幅上涨，并且几乎完全脱离了任何合理的公允价值估计。在极端的价格错位持续了一个多月之后，直到瑞士信贷在3月22日[同意](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/tvix-creation-units-return-what-it.html)以有限的方式重新开放创设单位的发行。简而言之，在这次宣布之后，价格在两天内下跌了超过50%（请看图表下面的跳空缺口），许多投资者遭受了巨大损失，随后是一系列诉讼。

- en: Credit Suisse allowed the price of TVIX to fall below 10.00 in late March and
    below 5.00 in late June, by which time I removed it from my radar screen and replaced
    it with a similar product, [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY),
    which has the additional benefit of being optionable. When TVIX slipped below
    1.00 last month, I assumed that Credit Suisse had consigned the ETN to a slow
    and painful death.

- en: Late last Friday, Credit Suisse [announced](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-ag-announces-reverse-011500337.html)
    a 1-10 reverse split, effective Friday (December 21^(st)) at the open. At today’s
    close of 0.79, a 1-10 split would bring TVIX back up to just 7.90, which is where
    the ETN was trading in June.

  zh: 在上周五晚些时候，瑞士信贷[宣布](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-ag-announces-reverse-011500337.html)一个1-10的反向分割，于本周五（12月21日）开盘时生效。在今天收盘价为0.79的情况下，1-10的分割会使TVIX回升至7.90，这是ETN在六月份的交易水平。
- en: Based on this news, I can only conclude that Credit Suisse intends to resurrect
    TVIX, which, much to my amazement, still has more assets than UVXY ($110 million
    vs. $100 million.)

  zh: 根据这个消息，我只能得出结论，瑞士信贷打算复活TVIX，这让我感到惊讶，因为TVIX的资产仍然比UVXY多（1.1亿美元对比1亿美元。）
- en: As I see it, this is still a case of too little, too late. At 7.90, TVIX is
    only one bad month away from slipping below the critical 5.00 level where most
    brokers begin to place significant restrictions on shorting. In terms of timing,
    where was Credit Suisse in April or May, when UVXY was taking significant mind
    share and market share from TVIX and a reverse split could have stemmed that tide?

  zh: 在我看来，这仍然是一个“为时已晚”的情况。在7.90的水平，TVIX只有一个月的下跌就会跌破大多数经纪人开始对做空设置重要限制的关键5.00水平。就时机而言，瑞士信贷在四月份或五月份在哪里，当时UVXY从TVIX手中夺取了显著的心智和市场份额，如果当时进行反向分割可能就能阻止那种潮流？
- en: Having made the switch to UVXY as my favored product for the +2x VIX ETP space,
    I am now quite comfortable with a product that has an active options market associated
    with it and have difficulty seeing the rationale for switching back to TVIX, particularly
    since UVXY has also had substantially more liquidity as of late.

  zh: 我已经将UVXY作为我最喜欢的+2x VIX ETP产品，我现在对一个有活跃期权市场的产品感到很舒服，并且很难找到回到TVIX的理由，特别是因为最近UVXY的流动性也显著更高。
- en: A number of notable VIXophiles are not even aware that TVIX is going through
    a reverse split, so this is likely to be an uphill battle for Credit Suisse. Ultimately,
    the burden of proof is back on TVIX – and on Credit Suisse – to persuade investors
    that the resurrection of this left-for-dead product is worth trading. As someone
    who has been an avid follower of TVIX from the day it was launched and who was
    writing about TVIX long before it was popular, count me as skeptical, but interested
    to see how the UVXY vs. TVIX drama plays out.

  zh: 许多知名的VIX爱好者甚至没有意识到TVIX正在进行反向分割，这对于瑞士信贷来说可能是一场艰苦的战斗。最终，证明的责任又落在了TVIX——以及瑞士信贷身上——要说服投资者这个被认为已经死亡的产品值得交易。作为一个从TVIX推出那天起就是其热衷追随者并且在其流行之前就开始撰写TVIX文章的人，我对这个产品持怀疑态度，但也很想看看UVXY和TVIX之间的戏剧如何发展。
