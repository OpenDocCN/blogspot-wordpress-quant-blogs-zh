    was selling a mortgage CDO derivative while the collateral that underlay it was
    collapsing in value (the ABX-HE 2007-1 BBB index had already started imploding,
    and was trading well below par). If Goldman did lose $83 MM on this deal as they
    say (because Goldman ended up long some of this issue), this means Fab did not
    tell Goldman this deal was doomed. He either mislead his own company, or was clueless
    as to what mortgage collateral credit analysis entails. I'm guessing the latter.

  zh: 将Fab Tourre视为一个可能的销售黑客。我不认识他，但是考虑到他是在抵押CDO衍生品压抵的担保物正在贬值（ABX-HE 2007-1 BBB指数已经开始崩溃，并且远低于票面价）。如果高盛确实在这笔交易上亏损了8300万美元（因为高盛最终是这个问题的持有方），这意味着Fab没有告诉高盛这笔交易是注定要失败的。他要么误导了自己的公司，要么对抵押贷款信用分析一无所知。我猜测是后者。

    consumers merely read their product manuals and followed the directions of the

    salesmen redundant, but we aren't their primary audience, and their benefit to
    the economy comes from the way they have sufficient knowledge and incentives to
    make a lot of consumers, especially those noobs, a little bit better. The point
    about Fab Tourre is that if we are going to learn something about the Credit Crisis
    of 2008, his level of knowledge is probably not useful to that end, in the same
    way that a MS Access salesman is not the best person for explaining the cutting
    edge trends in database development.

    Access销售员不是最好的人去解释数据库开发的最新趋势一样。
