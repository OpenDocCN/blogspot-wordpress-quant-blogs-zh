- en: 'I had lunch the other day with one of the IT staff from my client here in Sao
    Paolo, and we were talking about the work/life balance. I was asking him if he
    checked his Blackberry as soon as he got home, and he gave me the most astonishing
    reply. It seems that, unless you are on support rota (ie: on call), if you respond
    to a work-related message on your mobile device, then the company has to pay you
    overtime. So, as a rule, most banks do not give their employees company Blackberries.'

  zh: 前几天我和客户这里的的一名IT工作人员吃午饭，我们谈论了工作与生活的平衡。我问他在回到家后是否立即检查他的黑莓手机，他给了我一个令人惊讶的回答。似乎，除非你在支持轮换名单上（即：待命），如果你用移动设备回复与工作相关的信息，那么公司必须支付你加班费。因此，通常情况下，大多数银行不会给员工配备公司黑莓手机。
- en: Imagine if I could charge overtime to the companies that I have worked for when
    I responded to email at home? While climbing the Canadian Rockies? While drinking
    Cidra at a bar in Spain? Imagine how much nicer my vacations could have been if
    I had been forced to be disconnected from work?

  zh: 想象一下，如果我能向我所工作的公司收取加班费，当我在家回复电子邮件时？当我在加拿大落基山脉攀岩时？当我在西班牙酒吧喝苹果酒时？想象一下，如果被迫与工作断开联系，我的假期会变得多美好？
