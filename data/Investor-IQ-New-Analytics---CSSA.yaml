    generated using a composite of 28 different momentum and trend-following signals
    over time frames ranging from 1-12 months. The number of buy signals determines
    whether the overall signal is “buy”, “hold” or “sell.” The “Trend Strength” is
    a new feature which shows the percentage of buy signals across the 28 different
    momentum and trend systems. This allows users to differentiate between the strength
    of the trend across ETFs or stocks. The “Volatility Score” is also a new feature
    which shows the relative volatility ranking (low ranking=lower volatility) from
    0-100 across all ETFs or stocks. This can provide insight into relative risk and
    also allow users to form lower volatility portfolios with relative ease. A visual
    of the new output can be seen below:'
