- en: I don't often discuss trade idea results from the subscriber letter here on
    the blog. The last time I did was in June. But 2011 was another solid year and
    I thought it would be worth mentioning in the hope that Quantifiable Edges could
    help traders improve their results in 2012\. I don’t post results regularly because
    while I've always tracked trade ideas in the subscriber letter, it isn't the main
    focus of the service. I don't consider Quantifiable Edges to be a stock picking
    service. I consider it one where traders can gain market and trading knowledge
    through the published research, systems, and tools. The objective is to provide
    tools and instruction to help traders improve their own trading and results.

  zh: 我很少在这篇博客上讨论订阅者信件中的交易想法结果。上次我这么做是在六月。但2011年又是另一个稳扎稳打的一年，我觉得提一下是有价值的，希望量化边缘能帮助交易员在2012年提高他们的结果。我不定期发布结果，因为虽然我一直追踪订阅者信件中的交易想法，但这不是服务的主要焦点。我不认为量化边缘是一个股票挑选服务。我认为它是一个交易员可以通过发布的研发、系统和工具来获得市场和交易知识的场所。提供工具和指导帮助交易员提高他们自己的交易和结果。
- en: But the published trade ideas have done quite well. In fact, during 2011 October
    was the only month where the trade ideas failed to add up to positive gains. I've
    had several letters from subscribers lately telling me they've done quite well
    following certain ideas and that is always nice to hear.

  zh: 但已发布的交易想法表现得相当不错。事实上，在2011年，十月份是唯一一个月份，交易想法未能累积正收益。最近我收到了几封信，订阅者告诉我他们遵循某些想法做得很好，这总是令人愉快的。
- en: I don't suggest position sizes, and I would never suggest that the trade ideas
    represent any kind of complete portfolio strategy. They are what they are - ideas
    about certain stocks or ETFs that have historically provided a statistical edge.

  zh: 我不建议确定头寸大小，我也永远不会建议交易想法代表任何完整的投资组合策略。它们就是它们——关于某些股票或ETF的历史上提供统计优势的交易想法。
- en: It is important to note that all of the trade ideas are in either ETFs or in
    highly liquid large cap stocks (almost exclusively S&P 100 components). I do this
    so that executing trades and getting fills at reasonable prices is not an issue.
    I think traders feel the most frustrating aspect of following trade ideas offered
    by some services is not being able to get into or out of the trades that they
    suggest at a similar price. I’ve addressed this problem with limit prices and
    highly liquid securities.

  zh: 值得注意的是，所有的交易想法都是要么在ETF中，要么在高度流动的大型股票中（几乎完全是标普100的成分股）。我这样做是为了确保执行交易和以合理的价格获得成交不是问题。我认为交易员跟随某些服务提供的交易想法最令人沮丧的方面是无法以类似的价格进入或退出他们建议的交易。我通过限价和高度流动的证券解决了这个问题。

    their trading through the use of quantified research, and while doing so to help
    them offset the costs of the subscription by offering easy-to-execute trade ideas
    with a long-term positive profit expectancy. To date I believe Quantifiable Edges
    has succeeded in doing this.

- en: 'Today I broke the results down by year. Amazingly, for the 2nd year in a row
    the trade ideas during 2011 averaged a 1.00% gain per trade idea. I also listed
    all of December and January’s (so far) results below so that traders could see
    some examples. For tracking purposes I only count trades after they have been
    closed out. With most trades being of the swing variety this doesn’t normally
    skew results much. But we did just close out a big winner that was entered in
    November so 2012 results are overstated while 2011 are a bit understated due to
    that particular trade. First let’s look at the results by year:'

  zh: 最后，以下是交易想法结果表格中的说明和免责声明。
- en: '*All trade ideas ever tracked in the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter may
    be found on this spreadsheet. I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason
    for this is I’m not acting as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate
    to suggest allocation sizes without understanding someone’s financial situation
    and risk tolerance. Even for my own trading I run different portfolios with different
    levels of aggressiveness. For instance, my most aggressive may use options to
    sometimes get 300-400% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.**Since
    I don’t suggest position sizes this is should not be considered a performance
    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.**It’s unlikely anyone would have taken all of the trades with
    equal amounts, so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s
    approach. Simply adding up the results of the individual triggers as I do is an
    admittedly poor representation of returns. A net positive or negative does not
    necessarily mean a person following the ideas would have made or lost money during
    the period measured. And the sum total is certainly not representative of what
    a portfolio would return.**Feel free to contact me at support @ QuantifiableEdges.com
    if you have any questions.**As required by the NFA: Except where otherwise specifically
    stated, all trades are based on hypothetical or simulated trading. Hypothetical
    or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an
    actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
    Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over-compensated
    for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.
    Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are
    designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any
    account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.

  zh: 所有在Quantifiable Edges订阅信中跟踪过的交易想法都可以在这个电子表格中找到。我不建议确定头寸大小。这主要是因为我没有充当财务顾问的角色。我觉得在没有了解某人的财务状况和风险承受能力的情况下建议分配大小是不恰当的。即便是我自己的交易，我也运行着不同激进程度的多个投资组合。例如，我最激进的投资组合有时会使用期权来实现300-400%的杠杆。另一方面，其他投资组合通常采取更加保守的立场，有些很少达到或超过100%的敞口。**由于我不建议确定头寸大小，这不应该被认为是一个业绩报告，而是一个交易想法的记分卡。因此，不管我如何努力保持客观，结果的汇报总是取决于你如何处理交易而有所偏差。例如，我总是建议分三个阶段进入Catapult头寸，而“系统”交易（除了Catapult之外的任何我揭示的系统）通常是一次性进入。我通常也建议对“指数”交易进行分阶段进入。与我自己的交易相比，我在指数交易中的头寸要大得多。我还通过限制每天投资的总金额来控制我的敞口。如我所说，这将根据我交易的账户而有所不同。在我最激进的账户中，我可能会每天投入最多100%，并使用期权来实现高度杠杆。一个更加保守的账户可能每天最多达到15%-20%。**很可能没有人会以相等金额承担所有交易，因此个人结果将根据交易者的方法大相径庭。仅仅像我那样把个别触发器的成果加起来，公认是一种对回报的拙劣表现。正负净额并不一定意味着遵循这些想法的人在衡量期间会赚或亏钱。而且，总计当然不代表投资组合会返回的收益。**如果你有任何问题，请随时通过support
    @ QuantifiableEdges.com与我联系。**根据NFA的要求：除非另有特定声明，所有交易都是基于假设或模拟交易。假设或模拟的表现结果具有一定的固有限制。与实际的表现记录不同，模拟结果不代表实际交易。此外，由于交易实际上并未执行，结果可能未对任何市场因素的影响进行充分或过度的补偿，例如流动性的缺乏。一般的模拟交易程序也受到设计时具有后视镜优势的限制。没有做出任何账户将或可能实现与所示相似的利润或亏损的陈述。佣金、费用和滑点未包含在内。这既不是购买/出售证券或列出的期权的邀请。*
