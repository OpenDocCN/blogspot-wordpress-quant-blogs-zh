    and gold. The most interesting thing to emerge out of this episode is that gold
    appears to have re-asserted itself as a reserve currency as its price climbed
    in USD terms.

- en: The irony behind the Euro crisis is that it is not at all a condemnation of
    fiat money. In fact, it is a condemnation on single currency systems such as the
    gold standard. I have long argued that the mess the EMU created in 1999 with the
    inception of the Euro was unlikely to survive a serious global recession. This
    was due to one primary argument. The gold standard and single currency systems
    have all ended in demise for similar reasons. ***This was due to their inherent
    inflexibility and inherent weaknesses imposed on particular trade partners within
    the currency system.***

  zh: 欧元危机的讽刺之处在于，它根本不是对法定货币的谴责。事实上，它是对金本位制等单一货币系统的谴责。我一直认为，欧元区在1999年欧元诞生时所造成的混乱不太可能在全球严重衰退中幸存。这是由于一个主要论点。金本位制和单一货币系统都因类似原因走向灭亡。***这是由于它们固有的僵化和对特定贸易伙伴在货币系统中的固有弱点。***

    before it turned to "Gold", which he volunteered, he thought was dumb. Not that
    he thought the vaulting price was stupid. He offered no opinion of that. But,
    he said, the war years were tough. Really tough. (He was not of Serbian descent,
    as it would happen). He'd seen his friends, he explained, do the smash-n-grab
    (not literally) thing following the disintegration of what was Yugoslavia, rolling
    up ill-gotten gains into (amongst other material objects) hoards of gold. Their
    hedge. Their so-called mad money, for which he said chided them at the time, though
    to little effect. But, he went on, when things got really dire, there was no market
    for it. ***There was no way under the circumstances to reasonably convert the
    hoards to what one really needed. As a result, the going rate was all over the
    map, but half-ounce or ounces were commonly traded for sugar and flour in ratios
    that would make the wealth-hedging gold-bug weep***. I listened intently, though
    it was just an anecdote, but an interesting one nonetheless.

    Yugoslavia 解体后，进行了破坏和抢夺（并非字面意思）的事情，把不正当的收益投入到（除了其他物质对象）黄金储备中。他们的避险。他们所谓的疯狂金钱，为此他当时责备了他们，尽管效果不大。但是，他继续说，当情况变得非常糟糕时，市场上没有黄金的需求。**在那种情况下，没有办法合理地将储备转换成真正需要的东西。结果，黄金的市价波动很大，但半盎司或盎司的黄金常用于交换糖和面粉，这种比例会让避险的黄金狂热者痛哭流涕**。我聚精会神地听着，虽然这只是个轶事，但同样有趣。

    quite sub-optimal, and sugar, petrol, some vegetable seeds, a goat or two, an
    alembic, all make seeming better sense. Or, perhaps in the extreme, the best hedge
    in the event (if you believe in the event) of a breakdown in the rule of law,
