    Rather than post a study tonight, I thought I’d change things up a bit.

- en: In some comments on January 23rd, “Tim” mentioned he remembered an article I’d
    written a long time ago in which I discussed “double support stops”. (It was actually
    the first column I ever published). Since then I’ve seen a large number of readers
    have done searches on “Double Support Stop Rob Hanna” or something along those
    lines. Anyway, the column can’t be found anywhere anymore. But you want it – you
    got it. From way back in 2002 (along with a 2002 chart and ticker symbol - the
    ticker has since changed to HW if you want to pull it on your own software), I
    give you “The Double Support Trailing Stop”.

  zh: 在1月23日的某些评论中，“Tim”提到他记得我写过一篇很早的文章，讨论了“双支撑止损”。（实际上那是我所发表的第一篇文章）。从那时起，我注意到有很多读者进行了关于“双支撑止损Rob
    Hanna”或类似主题的搜索。不管怎样，那篇文章已经无处可寻。但你想看，就有。从2002年（附带2002年的图表和股票代码 - 股票代码后来改为HW，如果你想在自己的软件上拉取），我给你“双支撑跟踪止损”。

- en: '*The Concept* Like most traders, I have a whole checklist of criteria that
    must be met before I will consider purchasing a stock. I spend a substantial amount
    of time researching potential candidates so that I may find a few stocks that
    meet my criteria. One of the most frustrating and difficult things for me is finding
    a great stock, buying it at the right time, and then being stopped out of it just
    before it reverses and goes on to huge gains. Having traded in multiple time frames
    over the years I have experienced this frustration with day, swing, and intermediate
    term trades. To keep myself in winning trades longer and avoid being shaken out
    early, I developed my “Double Support Trailing Stop Technique”. I will show an
    example of this technique on an intermediate term trade, but have successfully
    employed it in many different time frames, and originally created it for my day
    trades.'

  zh: '*概念* 像大多数交易员一样，我有一整张符合购买股票的标准清单。我在研究潜在候选股票上花费了大量时间，这样我可能找到几只符合我的标准的股票。对我来说最沮丧和困难的事情之一是找到一只伟大的股票，在正确的时间购买它，然后在我被止损出仓，就在它反转并取得巨大收益之前。在多年的交易中，我经历了这种在日线、摆动线和中期交易中的挫折。为了让我在盈利的交易中待得更久，避免过早被震荡出仓，我开发了我的“双支撑跟踪止损技术”。我将在一个中期交易示例中展示这种技术，但在许多不同的时间框架中成功应用了它，最初是为我的日交易而创建的。'
- en: The idea is simple. If I require a large numbers of reasons to enter a trade,
    I should require more than just one reason to exit it if I want to catch as much
    of the move as possible. I will therefore require two levels of support to be
    broken before I will PERMANENTLY & COMPLETELY exit a trade. How you define support
    does not really matter. You can use pullbacks, consolidation lows (or highs),
    fibonacci’s, moving averages, trend lines, or whatever fits your trading style.

  zh: 这个想法很简单。如果我在进入交易时需要很多理由，那么如果我想尽可能抓住行情，我需要不止一个理由来退出交易。因此，在永久性和完全性地退出交易之前，我将需要两个支撑水平被打破。你如何定义支撑并不重要。你可以使用回调、整理低点（或高点）、斐波那契数列、移动平均线、趋势线，或者任何适合你交易风格的工具。
- en: '*An Example* Being that the below example is an intermediate term trade, I
    simply used consolidations & pullbacks, along with the 50 day moving average (shown
    as the rising blue line) for my support levels. I define a pullback to be any
    bar (or series of bars) with a lower low AND lower high after a stock has made
    new highs. The stock shown is Headwaters Inc (ticker: HDWR). I purchased this
    stock as it burst out of a flat base in the middle of March. My initial stop on
    the breakout would have been 8% from my purchase price, or the low of the base.
    After breaking out, it moved up sharply for 5 days before starting to pull back.
    It pulled back for seven days before reversing and moving higher. The low of this
    pullback is near the 1st green arrow labeled “Support”. It became support in my
    eyes after the stock move higher from there by making a higher high and higher
    low on the next bar. When that happened I was able to move my initial stop up
    to the breakout point. (I consider the high of a flat base or high tight flag
    to be a level of support also.)'

  zh: '*示例* 由于下面的示例是一个中期交易，我只是简单地使用了整理和回调，再加上50天移动平均线（显示为上升的蓝色线条）作为我的支撑水平。我将回调定义为任何一根（或一系列）柱子，在股票创新高之后，低点更低，高点也更低。这里显示的股票是Headwaters
    Inc（股票代码：HDWR）。我在三月中旬股票从横盘突破时买入这只股票。我的初始止损在突破时将是购买价格的8%，或横盘的低点。在突破后，它急剧上涨了5天，然后开始回调。它在回调了七天之后开始反转并上涨。这次回调的低点靠近第一个标记为“支撑”的绿色箭头。在我将其视为支撑之后，股票从这个位置上涨，在下一根柱子创下了更高的高点和更高的低点。当这种情况发生时，我能够将我的初始止损点上调至突破点。（我认为横盘的高点或高紧旗的高点也是一个支撑水平。）'
- en: Next, the stock moved up again for several days before making a second pullback
    down to the green arrow labeled “Broken Support”. The “Broken Support” bar was
    initially just the next area of support after the stock had pulled back and moved
    higher. When that happened, I was able to move my stop up under the 1st green
    support arrow. It became “broken” 5 days later when the next bar labeled “Support”
    moved below the low of “Broken Support”. If I had exited at the “broken support”
    level here, I would have been shaken out of the stock and missed the rest of the
    move. Instead, the stock continued to move up and create higher and higher support
    levels.

  zh: 接下来，股票在再次下跌至带有“破位支撑”标记的绿色箭头之前，又上涨了几天。这个“破位支撑”的柱子最初只是股票回调后再次上涨的下一个支撑区域。当这种情况发生时，我能够将我的止损点设置在第一个绿色支撑箭头之下。5天后，当下一根标记为“支撑”的柱子低于“破位支撑”的低点时，它变成了“破位”。如果我在这里按“破位支撑”的水平出场，我就被震出了股票，错过了后续的行情。相反，股票继续上涨，创造了越来越高
    的支撑水平。
- en: The time came for me to sell this stock at the area marked “Double Support (Sold
    When Broken)”. It was at this time that the stock moved below two levels of support.
    The first was the 50 Day Moving Average, and the second was the pullback low just
    above the “Double Support” green arrow. As you can see, this turned out to be
    a good time to take profits and exit this trade. Three days later it was trading
    nearly 30% lower.****

  zh: 到了我在标记为“双支撑（破位时卖出）”的区域卖出这只股票的时候了。这时，股票跌破了两个支撑水平。第一个是50天移动平均线，第二个是位于“双支撑”绿色箭头稍上的回调低点。正如你所看到的，这最终证明是一个很好的获利了结和结束这笔交易的时间。三天后，它的交易价格几乎下跌了30%。

- en: '*****Additional Considerations* Earlier I used the term “permanently & completely
    exit”. Due to the fact that the 1st and 2nd levels of support may be very far
    away from each other in some instances, I may consider exiting the position partially,
    or exiting and then looking for an opportunity to re-enter the position, when
    it breaks the 1st level of support. The main reason I would do this is not to
    give back too much of my profits. Once two levels of support are broken, I want
    to be completely out of the position and will not consider re-entering without
    a whole new base setting up.'

  zh: '****额外考虑因素* 我之前使用了“永久且完全退出”这个术语。由于在某些情况下第一和第二支撑位可能相距甚远，我可能会考虑部分平仓，或者平仓后寻找重新进入的机会，当价格突破第一支撑位时。我这样做的主要原因是为了不要回吐过多的利润。一旦支撑位被突破两个层次，我希望完全退出该仓位，并且不会考虑在没有全新基础形成的情况下重新进入。'

    it is most effective when you are trading with the overall trend of the market.
    In other words, long positions in an uptrending market, and short positions in
    a downtrending market.****
