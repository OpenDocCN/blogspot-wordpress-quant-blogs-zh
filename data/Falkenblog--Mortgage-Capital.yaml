- en: Back in the late 1990's when I was allocating economic capital, residential
    mortgages had the lowest amount of risk assigned to any major loan category. Most
    asset classes had about 7-9% allocations, mortgages about 4%. But this made sense
    in 1999, because back then people had 20% down payments and verified income commensurate
    with their debt payments. One would have never guessed, back in 1999, that among
    all the things banks could invest in, mortgages would be the trouble area. The
    Commercial Real Estate debacle of 1990, or the oil patch lending problems in the
    1980's, or lending to South America, was considered the biggest risk.

  zh: 回到20世纪90年代末，我在分配经济资本时，住房抵押贷款的风险分配是所有主要贷款类别中最低的。大多数资产类别约占7-9%，而抵押贷款约占4%。但这在1999年是有道理的，因为当时人们有20%的首付款，并且确认的收入与他们的债务支付相当。当时谁也不会猜到，那时候银行可以投资的所有东西中，抵押贷款会是一个麻烦的领域。1990年的商业地产丑闻，或1980年代的石油领域借贷问题，或者借贷给南美洲，都被认为是最大的风险。

    arguing the new lending standards were basically the same, in that poor people
    are even more likely to sell everything to meet their monthly payments. The data
    at that time would have backed them up through 2006\. Further, we will be sued
    or will not meet our CRA lending targets if we don't apply them, so it would have
    been hard to say that risk went up 100% because of what our erstwhile regulators
    were encouraging us to do. Regulators don't encourage banks to invest more in
    risky areas, after all.

  zh: 有些激进的下跌。业务部门负责人（LOB负责人）会争辩称，新的放贷标准基本上是一样的，因为穷人更有可能出售所有东西来支付他们的月度还款。当时的数据会一直支持他们直到2006年。另外，如果我们不应用这些标准，我们将被起诉，或者我们无法实现我们的CRA（美国合作交流协会）放贷目标，因此难以说因为我们往昔的监管机构鼓励我们这样做，风险增加了100%。毕竟，监管机构根本不会鼓励银行在风险领域投资更多。
- en: In 1999, internet lending was primarily called 'structured' finance, and derided
    as 'air ball' lending because you lent based on the equity of the firm--an 'air
    ball' to experienced lenders. The collateral would only be counted on when it
    was by definition worthless. Banks had minimal exposure to this bubble, because
    they saw it coming.

  zh: 在1999年，互联网借贷主要被称为“结构化”融资，并且因为你所借款的公司的股权被认为是“空洞”的融资，而被嘲笑。当抵押品实际上毫无价值时，抵押品可能被计入。银行对这一泡沫的暴露很小，因为他们看穿了它。
- en: We should not kid ourselves with all this focus on recent disastrous mortgage
    practices of banks. Having recently lost a boatload on residential mortgages,
    I suspect this will not be our problem area going forward. What is the current
    equivalent of residential mortgages circa 1999, the largest low risk asset on
    bank books? The only asset that did not explode in terms of its spread was US
    Treasuries. Given our new spending regime, poor demographics for social security,
    my best guess is that the banking sector's currently most riskless product is
    a good bet for our next lending cancer.

  zh: 我们不应该对银行最近在抵押贷款方面的灾难性做法过分自责。最近在住宅抵押贷款上亏损惨重，我怀疑这不会是我们未来的问题领域。什么是1999年的住宅抵押贷款的当前等价物，银行账户上最大的低风险资产？在利差方面没有爆炸的唯一资产是美国国债。考虑到我们的新支出制度，社会保障的不利人口结构，我的最佳猜测是，银行业当前最无风险的产品是我们未来的放贷癌症的好选择。
