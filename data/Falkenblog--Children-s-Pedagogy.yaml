    In a way, they are idiot savants, good at one kind of thinking (acquisition),
    poor at another (facts, judgment). A friend of mine had a foreign exchange student
    from Germany last year, I think she was a junior (ie, about 17). The girl thought
    of it as a sexual vacation and remarked to the shocked mom that the African American
    boys were much better in bed than the white boys. The mom was rather horrified
    by the example set for her own little snowflake; however, I was wondering how
    to interpret this lapse in judgment. In one scenario, the German exchange student
    was making stereotypes based on a few people, and this is a bad habit. On the
    other hand, she might have had statistically valid sample sizes and been inferring
    correctly. Either way it wasn't a good example for her little American sister.

    going over geometry because you really can''t use these things, instead, you define
    things like ''parallelogram'', and that''s it. He should learn the point of a
    concept, like a right triangle, is to solve problems. Until he can do more math,

  zh: 我8岁的儿子有一个不同的学习困境。我们公立学校的数学作业相当不连贯。他刚刚开始掌握加法和减法，而他最近的作业中有很多关于几何的问题：识别等腰三角形，直角三角形。在代数或三角之前，我看不出重温几何的意义，因为你真的用不着这些东西，相反，你定义像'平行四边形'这样的东西，就是这样。他应该学会一个概念的重点，比如直角三角形，就是为了解决问题。在他能做更多的数学之前，这些几何问题对他解决任何问题都没有帮助，所以只是毫无意义的死记硬背。

    forward when a concept (such as subtracting by 4 for single digit numbers) is
    mastered. Each week there's steady progress, and more complicated concepts are
    not addressed until students have mastered concepts necessary for their understanding.

    in pedagogy out of all this, at least for straightforward subjects like math and
    reading. Alas, I don't think it is much better than what was taught in the early
    twentieth century, in spite of probably a million people formally exposed to teaching
    as a discipline, and studying this systematically, writing theses, journal articles.
