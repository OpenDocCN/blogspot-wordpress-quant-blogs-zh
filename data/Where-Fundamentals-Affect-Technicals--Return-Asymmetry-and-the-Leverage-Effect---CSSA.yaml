- en: Believe it or not, fundamentals sometimes have predictable relationship with
    technicals. This relationship often is a function of the mathematics of balance
    sheet ratios, where the market value of the stock is a component. For example,
    balance sheet leverage—which is effectively debt divided by the market value of
    equity—is subject to constant change based on the stock price movements assuming
    a constant number of shares outstanding. Since most creditors have contractual
    agreements with a company based on the debt to equity ratio, the actual credit
    available or interest rate can be affected directly by changes in the market price.
    Furthermore,  access to capital can also be constrained by these factors. Effectively
    this means that changes in the stock price, whether rational or not, can have
    actual financial implications for a company’s cost of capital. But it does not
    stop there. Like any complex system, this process involves multiple feedback loops,
    where the drop in the stock price can cause increases in the cost of capital,
    which in turn can cause further changes in the stock price.

  zh: 相信与否，基本面有时与技术面有可预测的关系。这种关系通常是资产负债表比率数学函数的一部分，其中股票的市场价值是一个组成部分。例如，资产负债表杠杆率——实际上是负债除以股权市场价值——根据股票价格的变动而不断变化，假设持有的股份数量不变。由于大多数债权人与公司基于债务与股权比率的合同协议，市场价格变化直接影响实际可获得的信用额度或利率。此外，资本获取也可能受到这些因素的限制。实际上，这意味着股价的变化，无论是否合理，都可能对公司的资本成本产生实际的财务影响。但事情并不止于此。像任何复杂系统一样，这个过程涉及多个反馈循环，其中股价下跌可能导致资本成本上升，进而可能导致股价进一步变化。
- en: The “leverage effect”  and subsequent theory originated from early studies done
    by Fisher Black (of Black-Scholes fame). Black  found  that stock volatility tended
    to rise when stock prices went down and that volatility fell when prices went
    up. The economic rationale behind this effect is rooted in the firm’s capital
    structure. As a stock rises, the percentage of equity to debt rises, and the firm
    becomes less risky since the debt holders claims to the company value are more
    limited. Conversely, as the stock falls, the percentage of equity to debt falls,
    and the increased share of debt holder claims make the firm’s equity more risky.
    Thus a falling stock price should lead to an increase in future volatility.

  zh: “杠杆效应”及其后续理论源于费舍尔·布莱克（以其布莱克-斯科尔斯著名）的早期研究。布莱克发现，股票波动性在股价下跌时倾向于上升，而在股价上涨时则下降。这种效应背后的经济原理植根于公司的资本结构。随着股票价格上涨，股权与债务的比例升高，公司变得风险较小，因为债权人对公司价值的要求更有限。相反，随着股价下跌，股权与债务的比例下降，债权人要求的增加比例使公司的股权变得更加风险。因此，股价下跌应该导致未来波动率的增加。
- en: 'Anecdotally, most of us recognized aspects of “the leverage effect” in the
    huge rally following the depths of the credit crisis: the stocks that had the
    biggest rebounds were the ones that had 1) the worst balance sheets 2) the lowest
    stock prices 3) the largest declines. For the fundamentalist-this was a complete
    shock- many of these investors would assume that the best companies with the fastest
    growth would recover the most during the rally. The technicians  often subscribe
    to classic relative strength theory -that predicts that the best stocks to hold
    are always the ones that have the best one year or six month returns. For the
    technicians this was equally puzzling. But actually, it shouldn’t be if you understand
    “the leverage effect”. Regardless of whether the leverage effect is firm specific
    or systematic,  in a  “credit crisis” all firms come under pressure , and the
    most leveraged and riskiest firms are often under unprecedented levels of financial
    pressure. Since risk was so systemic in this case (as opposed to firm-specific
    or idiosyncratic), many large firms fell under this broad umbrella and ultimately
    traded near bankruptcy valuations. How else does the “math” of fundamentals work
    in this case? Well most educated finance students understand first of all the
    principle of balance sheet leverage: when you add debt to the balance sheet, a
    given % increase in sales has a disproportionately larger increase in the % increase
    in earnings because you are netting out a fixed interest cost. If we all agree
    that 1) the market tends to discount future GDP and hence revenues, and 2) that
    firm value is also a function of earnings growth and total earnings, ***then the
    firms that will experience the greatest percentage change in firm value when the
    market forecasts a recovery should mathematically be the most leveraged firms.***'

  zh: 传说中，我们大多数人都认识到在信贷危机的低谷之后，出现的巨大反弹中存在“杠杆效应”的方面：股票的最大反弹是那些具有 1) 最差的资产负债表 2) 最低的股价
    3) 最大下跌的股票。对于基本面派来说，这是一个完全的震惊 - 许多投资者会假设在反弹期间，增长最快的最佳公司会恢复最多。而技术派通常认同经典的相对强度理论
    - 预测应该持有的最佳股票是那些在一年或六个月内回报率最好的股票。对于技术派来说，这同样令人费解。但实际上，如果你理解“杠杆效应”，就不应该感到意外。不管“杠杆效应”是特定于公司还是系统性的，在“信贷危机”中所有公司都面临压力，而且最高杠杆和风险最大的公司通常面临前所未有的财务压力。由于在这种情况下风险是如此系统性的（与公司特定或特异性相反），许多大公司都属于这个广泛的范畴，并最终交易接近破产估值。在这种情况下，基本面的“数学”还能怎么解释呢？嗯，大多数受过教育的金融学生首先理解资产负债表杠杆原理：当你向资产负债表添加债务时，销售额的增长百分比将导致利润增长百分比的不成比例的增加，因为你要扣除固定的利息成本。如果我们都同意：1)
    市场倾向于贴现未来的国内生产总值和因此的收入，以及2) 公司价值也是收入增长和总收入的函数，那么在市场预测复苏时，数学上说应该预测收益最大的公司。
- en: This affects the technical trader in many ways whether you trade short-term
    or not. It means that the biggest winning stocks will have strong velocity relative
    to volatility (think sharpe ratio) only while the market is rising. When the market
    peaks, in fact, their velocity relative to volatility will have peaked at extraordinary
    levels. At this point the firm’s debt to equity is often at unsustainable  levels–leaving
    it vulnerable to the largest proportionate changes in firm leverage–and hence
    future volatility/downside risk. The opposite is true for the losing stocks-especially
    falling a major decline. This means that you have to be careful about going long
    a big winning stock when it has drifted upwards without any increase in volatility
    for too long, and conversely going short a big losing stock after it has exploded
    downwards without any reduction in volatility for too long. It also means that
    the biggest uptrends in the market emerge from the biggest downtrends and explosions
    in volatility, and the biggest downtrends start from extended periods in which
    you have persistent upward moves with extremely low volatility. It also means
    that you may further wish to reduce your exposure to the leverage effect if you
    are a relative strength investor by focusing on stocks that have little or no
    debt—not surprisingly these are often technology stocks such as those often found
    in the Nasdaq 100…….the list of choice for the Livermore Index.

  zh: 这对技术交易者产生了许多影响，无论你是短期交易还是长期交易。这意味着在市场上升时，最大的赢利股票相对于波动率（考虑夏普比率）将具有强劲的速度。当市场达到顶峰时，事实上，它们相对于波动率的速度将达到非同寻常的水平。在这一点上，公司的债务与股权往往达到了不可持续的水平——使其容易受到公司杠杆率最大比例变化的影响——因此未来的波动性/下行风险。而对于输掉的股票——尤其是在主要下跌时。这意味着当一个大赢利股票长时间没有任何波动性增加而上升时，你必须小心持有多头，反之，当一个大输掉的股票在长时间没有波动性降低的情况下急速下跌时，你必须小心持有空头。这也意味着市场中最大的上涨趋势是从最大的下跌趋势和波动爆炸中出现的，而最大的下跌趋势始于持续上涨期间的长时间内极低的波动性。这也意味着，如果你是一个相对强势的投资者，你可能希望通过专注于几乎没有债务的股票来进一步减少你的杠杆效应——毫不奇怪，这些股票通常是纳斯达克100中经常出现的科技股……。这是利物浦指数的首选名单。
