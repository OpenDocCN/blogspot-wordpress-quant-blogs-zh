    ETP 的公允价值）出现了一些有意义的溢价。
- en: For some historical perspective, consider that in the months prior to Credit
    Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) [suspending creation
    units](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)
    on February 21, TVIX typically traded at a premium of about 0.5% above its indicative
    value. After the creation units were suspended, the premium vacillated wildly
    (as seen in the graphic below), though for several weeks the premium was locked
    in a relatively narrow range of 10-20%. That premium over indicative value spiked
    to 89% on the day before the announcement that Credit Suisse was resuming creation
    units. Once that resumption of creation units was announced, the premium in TVIX
    fell all the way back to 2% in just three days, no doubt signaling to many that
    it would soon be business as usual in TVIX trading.

  zh: 为了一些历史视角，考虑到在瑞士信贷（[CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)）[暂停创建单位](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)之前的几个月，TVIX
    通常以比其指示价值高约 0.5% 的溢价交易。在创建单位被暂停之后，这个溢价剧烈波动（如下图所示），尽管在几周内，溢价锁定在一个相对较窄的范围内，即 10-20%。该溢价超过指示价值在宣布瑞士信贷恢复创建单位的前一天激增至
    89%。一旦宣布恢复创建单位，TVIX 中的溢价在短短三天内迅速回落至 2%，毫无疑问，这向许多人表明 TVIX 交易很快将恢复正常。

  zh: 然而，在过去三天中，TVIX 的溢价基本保持在 10-15% 的范围内，今天收盘时为 11.4%。
- en: The knee-jerk conclusion here is that there Credit Suisse may be considering
    the possibility of suspending the TVIX creation units once again. Another interpretation
    is that while Credit Suisse indicated they would reopen issuance of TVIX “on a
    limited basis,” it is now likely that the limited flow of TVIX creations units
    has not been sufficient to establish a price equivalence between TVIX and TVIX.IV,
    suggesting that an imbalance of supply and demand is persisting. Given the low
    trading volumes for the last three days, I am inclined to believe the that imbalance
    is more of an issue of supply constrains than one of excess demand, but here the
    simple interpretation of the data may not be the proper explanation.

  zh: 这里的一种肤浅的结论是，瑞士信贷可能正在考虑再次暂停 TVIX 创建单位的可能性。另一种解释是，尽管瑞士信贷表示他们将“有限地”重新开放 TVIX 的发行，但现在很可能
    TVIX 创建单位的有限流量并不足以建立 TVIX 和 TVIX.IV 之间的价格等价，这表明供求不平衡仍在持续。考虑到过去三天的低交易量，我倾向于相信这种不平衡更多地是供应限制而不是过剩需求的问题，但在这里，数据的简单解释可能不是恰当的解释。
- en: The fluctuations in the TVIX premium will be very interesting to watch going
    forward. One could argue that in spite of my many posts on TVIX, including a (pre-suspension)
    [reminder](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/will-tvix-go-to-zero.html) that
    the pricing supplement to the prospectus states in no uncertain terms, “The long
    term expected value of your ETNs is zero,” many investors had no idea what they
    were buying when they purchased shares of TVIX. In the six weeks since creation
    units were suspended, the public has had a reasonably thorough if sometimes painful
    education on the matter, even if some of this has come too late to avoid large
    losses.

  zh: TVIX溢价的波动在将来会非常有意思地观察。有人可能会认为，尽管我写了关于TVIX的许多文章，包括一个（在暂停前）[提醒](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/will-tvix-go-to-zero.html)文章，该文章明确指出，ETN的长期预期价值为零，但许多投资者在购买TVIX股份时并不知道他们买了什么。自从创建单位暂停以来六周，公众对此问题有了相对全面但有时痛苦的教训，即使其中一些可能来得太晚，无法避免巨大损失。
- en: Can this wiser and better educated investor class help to create another huge
    spike in TVIX premium? I have my doubts, but will certainly be watching in earnest.
    Remember that anyone who pays a 11% premium over fair value for TVIX should anticipate
    that the premium will evaporate sometime in the near future and that any short-terms
    gains will likely have to come in the form of other investors who are willing
    to pay an even larger premium to own an ETN that is likely to underperform [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    if the VIX does spike.

  zh: 这个更明智、受教育程度更高的投资者阶层能帮助创造TVIX溢价的另一大波吗？我持怀疑态度，但肯定会认真关注。记住，任何为TVIX支付11%的溢价超过公平价值的人都应该预计到溢价将在不久的将来蒸发，而且任何短期内的收益都可能来自于其他愿意支付更高的溢价来拥有一个可能会表现不佳[UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)的ETN的投资者。
- en: As an editorial aside, while TVIX may be taking it on the chin in terms of publicity,
    had this product been launched prior to the 2008 financial crisis, I have little
    doubt that many investors would have been genuflecting in front of it during the
    terror that gripped the stock market during its transition to a post-Lehman world.
