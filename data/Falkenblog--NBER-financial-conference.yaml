- en: So I'm at this NBER conference in Chicago, and today there were papers on the
    recent financial tumult. As with all conferences, there was a combination of interesting
    and uninteresting material presented.

  zh: 所以我参加了这次芝加哥的NBER会议，今天的论文是关于最近的金融动荡。和所有的会议一样，有一些有趣的东西，也有一些无聊的东西被呈现出来了。
- en: One neat set of papers was when Andy Lo presented his paper on a specific, mean-reverting
    strategy common to hedge funds, and noted it experienced 8 standard deviation
    losses back-to-back-to-back in August (8/7/07-8/9/07), and got it all back the
    final day (Friday, 8/10). It appears someone puked up the strategy pretty bad.
    Then, Kent Daniel noted that several standard long/short quant factors (eg, long/short
    book-to-market) also lost a lot on those days. So it seems that some big fund,
    or some big group of funds, all exited these strategies simultaneously, and got
    clobbered. Lo also documented that really short mean-reversion, say over a 1 hour
    period, lost a lot only in that period--generally a market maker makes money on
    mean reversion. It appears someone big was exiting and the standard liquidity
    providers were getting run over, so they just disappeared.

  zh: 安迪·罗（Andy Lo）发表了一篇有意思的论文，论述了对冲基金常见的均值回归策略，并指出这些策略在8月（8/7/07-8/9/07）连续经历了8个标准偏差的损失，最后一天（星期五，8/10）将所有损失都赚回来。似乎有人把这个策略玩坏了。然后肯特·丹尼尔（Kent
    Daniel）指出，几个标准的多空因素（例如，多空帐面价值比）在那些日子里也都损失了很多。因此似乎有一家大型基金或一大批基金，同时退出了这些策略，结果被击败。罗也指出那种真正的短期均值回归，比如在一个小时内，只在那个时间段损失了很多——通常市场做市商在均值回归上能赚钱。似乎有一家大公司正在抛售，标准流动性提供者被冲垮，所以它们干脆消失了。
- en: Atif Mian and Amir Sufi, besides having very symmetric names, presented an interesting
    paper on the degree to which the mortgage problem was supply vs. demand based.
    They note that several standard risk metrics of borrowers--debt to income, rose
    dramatically from 2000 to 2005\. So did the proportion of mortgage debt sold to
    third parties, which are rife for moral hazard (idiots buying loans originated
    by guys with no skin in the game, and thus have an incentive to be lax in underwriting).
    When house prices rise, the obligor's risk doesn't matter, because you merely
    repossess the collateral. But when prices flattened, the chicken came home to
    roost, and here we are. But they looked at thing by county, and it was suggested
    they look at those areas targeted by CRA and other government programs. It will
    be interesting if they find that the Fed's initiative, the Community Reinvestment
    Act, was a big reason for this problem. We will know soon.

  zh: 阿蒂夫·米安（Atif Mian）和阿米尔·苏菲（Amir Sufi），除了名字非常对称外，还展示了一篇有趣的论文，论述了抵押贷款问题是供给方还是需求方的程度。他们指出，从2000年到2005年，借款人的几项标准风险指标——债务收入比——急剧上升。出售给第三方的抵押贷款债务的比例也是如此，这种情况很容易引发道德风险（愚蠢的人购买了没有利益关系的贷款，因此倾向于在审核时放宽）。房价上涨时，债务人的风险并不重要，因为你只需拿回抵押品。但当房价止跌时，问题就爆发了，我们就在这里了。但他们查看了每个郡的情况，并建议将研究的重心放在那些开展社区再投资法案和其他政府计划的地区。如果他们发现美联储的倡议——《社区再投资法案》是这个问题的主要原因，那将会很有趣。我们很快就能知道了。
- en: There was also a neat note by Markus Bunnermeier. He estimates this calamaty
    is a $500B loss in market value. But that's about a 2% downtick in the S&P500\.
    So, it's not the magnitude of this mess that is the problem, but the concentration,
    and how it reverberates through the system.

  zh: 有马库斯·布纳迈尔（Markus Bunnermeier）还有一则有趣的笔记。他估计这场灾难造成了5000亿美元的市场价值损失。但这只是标普500指数下跌了2%。因此，问题不在于这场灾难的大小，而在于其集中度以及其如何在系统中产生连锁反应。
- en: There were some people talking about VAR performance, looking at the number
    of times big firms hit their 99% or 95% limits. I thought this was very strange,
    as I'm unsure what purpose a top-down VAR measure performs. At that level of aggregation,
    its pretty meaningless. I imagine it's just done for regulators, and generally
    considered meaningless by insiders.

  zh: 参与讨论的人们也议论了价值-at-risk（VAR）的绩效，观察这些大型企业超出他们99%或95%限制的次数。我认为这非常奇怪，因为我不确定自上而下的VAR测量有何用处。在那种层面，它几乎没有意义。我想这只是给监管机构看的，实际上内部人士认为它毫无意义。
