    I was quite surprised and heartened by the response.

- en: When I was in the process of assembling my initial draft of the trader stage
    development model, I had in mind a novice trader that was focusing primarily on
    stocks, but perhaps occasionally trading ETFs. With respect to options, my sense
    is that for the most part, novice traders avoid options entirely or take an occasional
    gamble on a potential big winner by buying out of the money calls or puts.

  zh: 当我正在整理交易者阶段发展模型的初稿时，我心中想的是一个主要关注股票，但也许偶尔会交易ETF的新手交易者。关于期权，我的感觉是，大多数新手交易者完全避免期权，或者偶尔会买入深度虚值看涨或看跌期权，赌一把潜在的大赢。

- en: I suspect quite a few beginning traders get frustrated with some of the stage
    one issues associated with entries, leverage and position sizing and before coming
    to terms with these issues, they decide that stocks just aren’t the right trading
    vehicle for getting rich in a hurry. Attracted by the leverage potential of options,
    these traders make the jump from stocks to options and in so doing, simply magnify
    the cost of their mistakes. Of course, this is absolutely the worst way to approach
    options. Almost without exception, traders who follow this course of action succeed
    only in accelerating the time it takes to blow out their account.

  zh: 我怀疑很多初入市的交易者会对一些与开仓、杠杆和仓位规模相关的第一阶段问题感到沮丧，在彻底弄懂这些问题之前，他们就认为股票不是迅速致富的合适交易工具。由于期权的杠杆潜力，这些交易者从股票交易转向期权交易，在这个过程中，只是放大了他们的错误成本。当然，这是处理期权的最糟糕方式。几乎无一例外，遵循这种行动方式的交易者只是加速了耗尽账户资金的时间。
- en: The situation is only marginally better for traders who make the jump to options
    after advancing to stage two and are grappling with how to cut losses while letting
    winners run. With options positions much more volatile than stocks and spreads
    much wider, many of the exit strategies that work well for stocks do not work
    as well with options. Further, some traders become confused about whether to use
    the options, the underlying or both as their cues for when to exit. On a personal
    level, while I think mastering the art of exiting positions is a critical success
    factor for anyone who trades stocks, I found that porting the lessons I learned
    about stock exit strategies to options was nowhere near as easy as I had hoped.

  zh: 对于在达到第二阶段后转向期权交易的交易者来说，情况也只是略有好转，他们正在努力掌握如何在止损的同时让盈利头寸奔跑。由于期权的波动性远大于股票，且价差更宽，许多在股票上表现良好的退出策略在期权上并不那么有效。此外，一些交易者对于是使用期权、标的资产还是两者都作为退出信号感到困惑。从个人角度来看，虽然我认为掌握退出头寸的艺术是任何股票交易者成功的关键因素，但我发现将我在股票退出策略上学到的教训应用到期权上并不像我希望的那么容易。

    options will be difficult to trade profitably, but these traders should understand
    most of the hurdles to success and what it takes to overcome them. Still, edges

    in augmenting their trading with options, their time and effort will likely be
    rewarded. On the other hand, for those traders who are still mired in stage one
    and stage two of their development process, options are almost certain to be a
    disaster and result in large losses.

  zh: 底线是，对于那些想要通过期权增强其股票交易的第三阶段股票交易者来说，他们投入的时间和努力很可能会得到回报。另一方面，对于那些仍然陷入其发展过程的第一阶段和第二阶段的交易者来说，期权几乎肯定会是一场灾难，并导致巨大损失。
