- en: I am generally not a fan of being long any options during options expiration
    week, as the effort required to ‘salmon’ upstream against the relentless current
    of time decay (theta) makes these trades extremely challenging.  Not only do you
    have to get the direction right, but you have to do it in a big way and in a hurry.  Of
    course, if there is another volatility event that you have to overcome during
    options expiration week, that makes the task even more difficult.

  zh: 通常情况下，在期权到期周不建议持有任何期权，因为顺流而下的时间衰减（theta）使这些交易极为具有挑战性。不仅要正确判断方向，还要迅速大幅发展。当然，如果在期权到期周还有其他波动性事件需要克服，那将使任务更加困难。

- en: With the conflicting numbers and multiple interpretations available, the market
    action has been interesting to watch.  After closing at 261.09 yesterday, BIDU
    traded up almost 30 points in the after hours session last night, before settling
    back to an after hours gain of about 18 points.  In pre-market the stock gradually
    slid down to 274, up about 13 points over Wednesday’s close.  When the regular
    session opened, the stock fell quickly to 263, recovered sharply to trade briefly
    above 280, and has been in a downtrend ever since, currently trading back down
    to about 267.

  zh: 面临矛盾数据和多种解释的情况下，市场行情变化令人关注。昨天收盘下跌至261.09后，BIDU在昨晚盘后交易中几乎上涨30点，然后回升至盘后上涨约18点。盘前交易中股价逐渐下滑至274，较周三收盘价上涨约13点。正式交易开始后，股价迅速下跌至263，迅速反弹一度交易至280以上，此后一直处于下跌趋势，目前交易回落至约267。
- en: The first graphic, which comes from optionsXpress, shows how the options were
    behaving after about a half hour of trading, when BIDU was up 16.97 at 278.06.  If
    you happened to be long BIDU calls at a strike of 270 or above, you were losing
    money, even with the stock up 6.5%.

  zh: 第一张图来自optionsXpress，显示了在大约半小时的交易后，选BIDU上涨16.97至278.06时期权的表现。如果你长期持有行权价为270或以上的BIDU看涨期权，即使股价上涨6.5%，你也会亏损。
- en: Normally, one would expect a post-earnings [volatility crush](http://tradeoptioned.blogspot.com/2007/06/volatility-crush.html),
    where IV contracts and all options lose their value, but as the iVolatility chart
    on the bottom shows, IV was not particularly high (relative to recent historical
    BIDU levels) coming into earnings, nor did it drop dramatically after earnings
    were out (see the IV numbers in the optionsXpress table.)

  zh: 通常情况下，在季度业绩公布后会发生[波动性压缩](http://tradeoptioned.blogspot.com/2007/06/volatility-crush.html)，隐含波动率收缩，所有期权价值损失，但下图的iVolatility图表显示，IV并不特别高（相对于BIDU最近的历史水平），并且在季度业绩公布后IV并未急剧下降（请参考optionsXpress表中的IV数据）。
- en: BIDU’s action today is an excellent illustration of what happens toward the
    end of the options expiration cycle, when time decay accelerates.  While it is
    still possible to make money being long options, the percentages are with those
    who are on the side of time decay.  If you are looking at a stock with high IV
    and an earnings report or other volatility event, consider that at the money options
    can still be losers even if you get the direction correct and have a 6.5% move
    in the underlying on your side.

  zh: BIDU今天的走势很好地诠释了期权到期周期末期，时间衰减加速。虽然依然可能通过持有期权获利，但在时间衰减方面占据优势。如果你关注一只隐含波动率高的股票及其季度业绩或其他波动性事件，要考虑即使正确判断方向并且股价下跌6.5%，平值期权依然可能亏损。
