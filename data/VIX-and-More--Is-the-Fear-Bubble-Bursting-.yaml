- en: Looking at previous bubbles, I wonder if the fear bubble is analogous to an
    oil bubble. You see macroeconomic events moving inexorably in the same direction
    day after day and you begin to assume the future is a predestined march down what
    looks like an unavoidable path.

    I talked about signs I was seeing that fear was already “starting to leave the
    markets.” The VIX has already fallen more than 15% from Monday’s close and there
    is a good chance it will be at least another decade before it sees the 80s again.

    in the System for a Generation?](http://www.informationarbitrage.com/2008/10/is-volatility-embedded-in-the-system-for-a-generation.html)
    In it, Roger paints a picture of a financial crisis receding only to the point
    that it exposes gaping fundamental holes in the economy, the substantial risk
    of a Japan-style deflation, and a Fed so determined to prevent deflation that
    their easy money policy leads to runaway inflation and ultimately some sort of
    cruel game of low growth inflation-deflation ping pong.

    describes a VIX of 40 as the new 20 and predicts a much higher floor for volatility

    VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/big-question-for-vix.html) back on
    May 22^(nd) when the VIX closed at 18.05\. The big question back then, with a
    financial crisis raging, oil approaching 150, and investor anxiety on the increase,
    was why the VIX was below 20.

- en: 'Just five months ago, which was the more unlikely scenario: crude oil at 60
    or the VIX at 90? It’s hard to say, but suffice it to say that it would have been
    hard to find the appropriate strikes to even make such a bet back then.'

    oil prices that were driving estimates of future economic activity and volatility,
    now the economy is the cause and oil, volatility and the like are the effects.
