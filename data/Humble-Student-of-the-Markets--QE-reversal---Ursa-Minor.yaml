    than it spends on imports and Chinese investment abroad, the People's Bank of
    China, the central bank, is forced to buy those excess dollars to maintain the
    value of the yuan. It does this by borrowing yuan in the domestic markets. But
    because its borrowing cost is greater than the return it receives when it invests
    those dollars in low-earning U.S. Treasury bonds, the central bank loses money
    as its reserves expand. Large companies bringing money into the mainland also
    force the central bank to expand the domestic money supply when it purchases the
    inflows, expanding the amount of credit in the system.

  zh: 黄金（GLD）是所有图表中最难看的之一。请注意，然而，它在大约四月和五月的时候反弹，填补了绿色显示的缺口，但它继续疲软，已经显示出两个（黄色）尚未在缓解反弹中填补的缺口。

  zh: 欧洲的情况如何？下面这张代表欧元区股票的FEZ图表显示，虽然我们看到了一个小幅的缓解反弹，但欧元区股票并没有反弹到填补其缺口的位置。

    trader''s conclusion is that the relief rally isn''t quite finished yet. We are
    likely to see several weeks of volatility before the process is complete before
    the longer term fundamentals of the recalibration of risk premiums pushes asset
    prices lower.'

  zh: 这是目前的得分。缺口填补的板块：3；未填补的缺口：2。我内心的交易者结论是，缓解反弹还没有结束。在长期风险溢价调整的基本面推动资产价格下跌之前，我们可能会看到几周的波动。
