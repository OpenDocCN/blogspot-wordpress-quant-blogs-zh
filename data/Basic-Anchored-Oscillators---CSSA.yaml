- en: To take a brief but related digression from the **Adaptive Time Machine**, I
    would like to discuss the importance of anchored versus rolling oscillators. Almost
    all conventional indicators are rolling–that is for example an rsi2 only looks
    at the current position of the market over the last two days without regard to
    what has happened before that. In relation to the different runs based entries
    and exits, it is not so obvious that a strategy such as entering on two days down
    and exiting on two days up could actually last for two weeks or more. This is
    because an up day that fails to follow through can occur numerous times prior
    to exit.  Furthermore, the entry stipulation of a down run of two days can also
    occur under similar circumstances. A down run could also occur after two very
    large down days, or perhaps two small down days. Clearly not all up or down runs
    are made equal.

  zh: 为了对**自适应时间机器**稍作相关的偏离，我想讨论锚定振荡器与滚动振荡器的重要性。几乎所有传统指标都是滚动的 - 例如，rsi2仅仅是看着市场过去两天的当前位置，而不考虑之前发生的事情。与基于不同运行的进出有关，进入两天下跌并在两天上涨时退出这样的策略实际上可以持续两周甚至更长时间。这是因为一个没有后续的上涨日可以在退出之前发生多次。此外，两天下跌的入场规定也可以在类似情况下发生。在两天非常大的下跌之后，或者在两天小的下跌之后，可能会发生下跌。显然，并非所有上涨或下跌都是平等的。
- en: 'In fact I would argue that one of the main reasons that traders sometimes “disagree”
    with what an indicator is saying is precisely for this same reason: often the
    current level fails to take into account what appears to be common sense to the
    trader. What we really want to do is to create an indicator “with a memory”  and
    also use different methods of normalization in order to avoid such situations.
    The Runs Oscillator [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/runs-oscillator/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/runs-oscillator/)
    addressed the issue of normalizing run length, but being a rolling indicator,
    it fails to address some of the problems in the examples above.  Rolling indicators
    make life difficult for adaptive systems as well because we typically utilize
    some  performance selection criteria in order to identify the most favorable situations.
    If the comparable situation is not like past situations, then we may do better
    or worse than what was observed in the past. In a sense, this contributes to the
    noise involved with classification.'

  zh: 实际上，我认为交易者有时“不同意”指标的主要原因之一恰恰是因为这个原因：通常当前水平未能考虑到交易者看来是常识的事情。我们真正想要做的是创建一个“带有记忆”的指标，并且还要使用不同的归一化方法来避免这种情况。[Runs
    Oscillator](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/runs-oscillator/) 解决了归一化运行长度的问题，但是作为一个滚动指标，它未能解决上述示例中的一些问题。滚动指标也使得自适应系统变得困难，因为我们通常利用一些性能选择标准来识别最有利的情况。如果可比较的情况与过去的情况不同，那么我们可能会比过去观察到的情况更好或更差。在某种程度上，这增加了与分类相关的噪音。
- en: 'A basic anchored indicator will have both a trigger point as well as an exit
    point. Once a situation is triggered, we measure the distance traveled in terms
    of both time and price until an exit occurs. A simple example pertains to daily
    mean reversion as defined in this recent post by MarketSci: [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/the-new-state-of-short-term-mean-reversion-july-2010/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/the-new-state-of-short-term-mean-reversion-july-2010/)
    as buying on down days and shorting on up days.  In this case for longs, the trigger
    would be one down day and the exit would be one up day. Once a trade was initiated
    (on one down day) we would measure the distance traveled since entry in % terms
    or atr, and also the days that have elapsed- in this case a down run- until an
    up day occurs (the exit).  This method of combined analysis that looks at magnitude
    (price) and stretch (time) underlies the DVI – which is also a rolling indicator.
    This is what makes the DVI so useful, but also- excepting the intentional smoothing-
    somewhat ineffective at identifying turning points. In this case, a complex anchored
    runs oscillator would consider also the distance travelled either during the trigger
    condition, following the trigger condition, the exit condition or all three. There
    is a lot in that last sentence to think about, in a subsequent post we will provide
    an example.'

  zh: 一个基本的锚定指标会有一个触发点和一个退出点。一旦情况被触发，我们就会测量直到退出发生的时间和价格距离。一个简单的例子是指每日均值回归，正如MarketSci最近的帖子中定义的那样：[http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/the-new-state-of-short-term-mean-reversion-july-2010/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/the-new-state-of-short-term-mean-reversion-july-2010/)，在跌幅日买入，涨幅日卖出。在这种情况下，对于多头来说，触发条件是一个跌幅日，退出条件是一个涨幅日。一旦交易开始（在一个跌幅日），我们就会测量自进入以来的距离，以百分比或atr计算，还有已经过的天数-在这种情况下是一个下跌阶段-直到出现涨幅日（退出）。这种同时考虑幅度（价格）和时间跨度的综合分析方法是DVI的基础，DVI也是一个滚动指标。这就是使DVI如此有用的原因，但除了故意平滑之外，它在识别转折点方面有些无效。在这种情况下，一个复杂的锚定运行振荡器还将考虑在触发条件期间，触发条件后，退出条件或所有三种情况下已经行进的距离。在最后一句中有很多值得思考的内容，在随后的帖子中我们将提供一个示例。
