- en: Someone asked if the market also would fail Geithner's objectives for new regulations.
    Surely not, if we define 'to serve, protect and reward' sufficiently. But the
    key point is regulation is rarely effective at what it supposedly does, just think
    about NYSE floor traders who screwed investors for years via their monopoly control
    of stock market trading for decades, and the lack of competition on commission
    until the 1970's, all while there were these 1930's era regulations that supposedly
    protect the investor (the SEC acts of 1934 and 1941). Public regulation enhances
    the ability of insiders to fleece the public because that's what happens to regulation,
    insiders use the regulations as barriers to entry, and write them for that purpose.
    Rahm Emmanuel types, the kind who make $13MM in 3 years while out of government,
    make regulation work for them. Those who merely try to innovate and compete, are
    an annoyance for the elites who hypocritically always talk about helping the poor
    stiff while making sure they are lining up patronage jobs for their cronies. Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac made a fortune for political hacks for decades, always for
    the pretext of helping the poor and historically under served.

  zh: 有人问市场是否也会违背盖特纳的新规定目标。如果我们定义"为服务、保护和奖励"得足够清楚的话，那当然不会。但关键点是，监管很少有效地做到了它应该做的事情，想想一想纽约证券交易所的地板交易员们几十年来如何通过对股市交易的垄断控制来欺骗投资者，直到20世纪70年代前，手续费的不竞争性才得到了解决，而在此期间却一直有着那些所谓保护投资者的1930年代监管法案（1934年和1941年的证券交易委员会监管法案）。公共监管增强了内部人利用法规欺诈公众的能力，因为这就是监管的结果，内部人利用法规作为进入市场的障碍，并为此而制定法规。拉姆·伊曼纽尔类型的人，那种在政府外3年收入1300万美元的人，让监管为他们工作。而那些试图进行创新和竞争的人，对于那些虚伪地总是谈着如何帮助穷人的精英来说，不过是个烦扰，而他们却总是确保他们的贫民窟朋友们能获得光明之路工作。房利美和房地美几十年来为政治乌合之众牟取了一笔钱财，总是以帮助贫困和历史被忽视的人做为借口。
- en: The Market is filled with self interested people who have to convince people
    their service is actually better than its alternatives and is worth the cost.
    Regulation is filled with self interested people who simply tell people what to
    do. The most uncompetitive market is nothing compared to a legal mandate.

  zh: 市场充满了自私的人，他们必须说服人们他们的服务实际上比其他选择更好，并且他们的价值高于成本。监管充满了自私的人，他们只是命令人们做事。最不具竞争力的市场也比不上法定命令。
- en: The chief difference between the market and regulation is that under the former
    a man pursues his own advantage openly, frankly and honestly, whereas under the
    latter he does so hypocritically and under false pretenses.

  zh: 市场和监管之间的主要区别是，在前者下，一个人可以公开、真诚和如实地追求自己的利益，而在后者下，他只能虚伪地和诡辩地那样做。
- en: All this hullabaloo about mortgages ignores the fact that this mistake will
    not made again in our lifetimes. It will be a different mistake. Thus, we are
    now hiring thousands, and writing pages of regulations, specifically targeting
    spilled milk. This is just a waste of time.

  zh: 所有关于抵押贷款的喧嚣声都忽略了这样一个事实，即这个错误在我们的有生之年内不会再次发生。这将是一个不同的错误。因此，我们现在正在雇佣成千上万的人，并撰写大量的法规，专门针对“泼洒的牛奶”。这只是浪费时间。
