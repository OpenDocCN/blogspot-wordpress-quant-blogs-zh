    [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index),
    which I have discussed in this space [several times](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)
    in the past year.  While the McClellan Summation Index draws upon NYSE advance
    decline data, I am actually a little bit partial to the NASDAQ variant.  For those
    who use StockCharts.com, the ticker for the NASDAQ summation index is [NASI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNASD.html)
    and the NYSE/McClellan version is the [NYSI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNYSE.html).

  zh: 当谈到市场宽度指标时，我特别喜欢[McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)，我在过去的一年里在这个空间[讨论过几次](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)。虽然McClellan
    Summation Index利用了NYSE的涨跌数据，但我实际上更偏爱NASDAQ的变体。对于使用StockCharts.com的人来说，NASDAQ汇总指数的股票代码是[NASI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNASD.html)，而NYSE/McClellan版本是[NYSI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNYSE.html)。

    a buying opportunity or a warning sign?'

  zh: 所以这是一个大问题：历史上低的NASI涨跌数据是一个买入机会还是一个警告信号？
- en: In order to best answer that question, I have included a chart below that plots
    NASI data going back ten years.  It clearly shows that buying on any significant
    NASI dip (say -900 or lower) since the October 2002 bottom has been an excellent
    investment tactic, as was the run up to the 2000 market top.  The graph also shows,
    however, that during the 2000-2002 bear market, this was a risky strategy that
    tried to capture short bounces which were brief countertrends against a falling
    tide.  It was possible to be successful, but tight stops and/or a narrow time
    horizon were needed to control risk.

  zh: 为了最好地回答那个问题，我下面附上了一个图表，该图表绘制了过去十年NASI数据。它清楚地表明，自2002年10月低点以来，在任何一个显著的NASI低迷（比如-900或更低）买入都是一个优秀的投资策略，正如2000年市场顶部的上涨一样。然而，该图表还显示，在2000-2002年的熊市期间，这是一个试图捕捉短期反弹的策略，这些反弹是逆潮流而动的短暂反趋势。成功是可能的，但需要设置紧止损和/或狭窄的时间范围来控制风险。
- en: When all is said and done, we are back to a discussion about whether it makes
    sense to buy on the dips.  In a well defined uptrend, there is not doubt that
    this is a winning strategy.  In a bear market, one can still make money on the
    bullish countertrend, but these need to be surgical strikes.  There isn’t much
    in the way of sideways action evident in this long-term chart, but it is safe
    to conclude that buying on the dips in a non-trending market – classic oscillator-based
    trading – is less profitable than trading with the trend, but offers more substantially
    opportunity than trying to trade against it.

  zh: 当一切都说完的时候，我们又回到了一个讨论：在市场低迷时买入是否合理。在一个定义良好的上升趋势中，毫无疑问，这是一种获胜的策略。在熊市中，人们仍然可以在看涨的反趋势中赚钱，但这些需要是精确的打击。这张长期图表中并没有明显的横向行动，但可以肯定的是，在非趋势市场中买入市场低迷——基于振荡器的交易策略——不如随趋势交易的利润高，但比试图逆势交易提供了更多的机会。
- en: My current reading of the NASI is that we are more likely than not to get a
    bounce off of current levels; if it turns out we are in a bear market, these gains
    will be short-lived, but if we are putting in a bottom of at least intermediate-term
    length, there is considerable opportunity to the upside.

  zh: 我对NASI的当前看法是，我们很可能会从当前水平反弹；如果结果我们处于熊市，这些收益将是短暂的，但如果我们正在形成至少中期长度以下的底部，那么上方有很大的机会。
