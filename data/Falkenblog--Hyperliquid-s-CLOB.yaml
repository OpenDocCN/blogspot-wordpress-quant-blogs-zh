    with founder Jeff Yan, where he spoke with Corey Hoffstein, a quantitative long-term
    equity portfolio manager. Hoffstein's background and demeanor prevented him from
    calling out Yan's BS, which is fine because most good podcast hosts are credulous
    and agreeable; otherwise, no one would go on their shows. Yan spouts many typical
    crypto/market maker cliches among those trying to impress people who are vaguely
    familiar with the issues. For example, when talking about his earlier trading
    experience, he said he 'was surprised how inefficient markets were.' This is a
    great phrase because it implies one was outsmarting people, an alpha generator,
    and it does exist, so it is possible.

  zh: 我收听了 *与模型调情* [播客](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqCksxcX49w&list=WL&index=4&t=366s)，它与创始人
    Jeff Yan 进行了对话，他与 Core Hoffstein 进行了对话，Core 是一位量化长期股权组合经理。Hoffstein 的背景和举止使他无法指责
    Yan 的 BS，这没关系，因为大多数优秀的播客主持人都是轻信的和随和的；否则，没有人会上他们的节目。Yan 在尝试给那些对这些问题略微熟悉的人留下印象时，他说了很多典型的加密/做市商陈词滥调。例如，当谈论他早期的交易经验时，他说他“被市场的效率低下所惊讶”。这是个很棒的说法，因为它暗示着自己在智胜他人，是个阿尔法产生器，而且它确实存在，所以可能。
- en: Yet, one should provide several good examples to demonstrate you are more than
    just bloviating. In crypto, there was the famous Kimchi premium, where coins traded
    at 10% in Asian countries. This inefficiency persisted because it required trusted
    partners in the US and Japan or Korea to make the trade, which is non-trivial.
    In any case, it was over by early 2018 and required connections instead of savvy.
    Nonetheless, many Sam Bankman-Fried interviewers were blown away by SBF's singular
    arbitrage example, presumably one of his many clever trades. Looking back at Alameda's
    tax returns and the fact that most FTX traders left FTX throughout 2018 (no bonus
    pool), this was likely his only profitable trade outside of buying coins in the
    2021 bubble with customer funds (see [here](https://efalken.substack.com/p/ftxs-mythical-origin-story)
    for more). Thus, we have FTX exec Sam Trabucco bragging about their other genius
    trade idea, buying Doge when Elon Musk tweeted about it. The Kimchi premium was
    the only inefficiency Yan mentioned on the podcast.

  zh: 然而，人们应该提供几个很好的例子来证明你不只是在吹牛。在加密货币领域，有一个著名的泡菜溢价（Kimchi premium），在亚洲国家，加密货币交易价值比正常价值高出10%。这种效率低下一直存在，因为需要在美国和日本或韩国找到可信赖的合作伙伴进行交易，这是一件不容易的事情。无论如何，到2018年初就结束了，需要关系而非见识。尽管如此，许多
    Sam Bankman-Fried 的面试者都被 SBF 的奇特套利案例所震惊，很可能是他的许多聪明交易之一。回顾 Alameda 的税收和事实，在 2018
    年，FTX 大部分交易员都离开了FTX（没有奖金池），这可能是他唯一的有利可图的交易，除了使用客户资金在 2021 年泡沫期间购买硬币（更多信息请参见[这里](https://efalken.substack.com/p/ftxs-mythical-origin-story)）。
    因此，我们看到 FTX 高管 Sam Trabucco 自夸他们的另一个天才交易想法，即在 Elon Musk 发推有关 Doge 时购买。泡菜溢价是 Yang
    在播客中提到的唯一效率低下的例子。
- en: 'When Yan was asked about the difference between maker and taker high-frequency
    strategies, Yan stated that a taker strategy might make only one trade a day.
    An HFT taker strategy involves sniping the top of the book before an LP can cancel.
    By definition, it can''t do this to a large volume, as the top of the book is
    not big. The edge is the spread at best. That''s a large amount of risk and capital,
    adding up to a couple of bucks per day. He described a strategy that has never
    existed because it makes no sense: a once-a-day HFT taker strategy.'

  zh: 当 Yan 被问及做市商和高频交易策略之间的区别时，Yan 表示，作为高频交易策略的做市商可能一天只进行一次交易。高频交易的做市商策略包括在 LP 在取消前夺取订单簿的顶部。按照定义，它不能大量交易，因为订单簿的顶部份额不多。最多只是价差。这是一个很大的风险和资本，每天多达几美元。他描述的策略从未存在过，因为这毫无道理：一天一次的高频交易做市商策略。
- en: Yan highlighted that Hyperlink's L1 can do things that would otherwise be impossible
    and emphasized updating a perp account for hourly funding payments. This is pointless.
    Given the horizon of perp traders—days, weeks—crediting their accounts hourly
    instead of waiting until the position is closed is pointless. A 50% funding rate
    is a 1% potential boost for a week-long position, which would be long for perps.
    No rational trader will be excited by having that trivial amount accelerated into
    hourly payments. Again, this highlights Yan's cluelessness.

  zh: Yan强调了Hyperlink的L1可以做一些否则不可能的事情，并强调了对每小时资金支付进行持续更新的帐户。这是毫无意义的。考虑到永续合约交易者的视野——天、周——每小时结算他们的账户与等待位置关闭是毫无意义的。对于持续了一周的头寸来说，50%的资金费率对于他们来说是1%的潜在提升，这对于交易者来说会很长。没有理性的交易者会因为这个微不足道的金额加速成小时付款而感到兴奋。这再次突显了Yan的愚蠢。
- en: Yan says he then decided to build an exchange on his own L1 because of the Impermanent
    Loss problem in AMMs. I agree that Uniswap's AMMs are unsustainable because they
    lose more money to this expense, but CLOBs on blockchains are not the solution.
    A fast L1 will still be slow because the CEXs are centralized, and co-located
    servers can respond to exchange messages within 5 microseconds. A centralized
    L1 is pointless, like a private permissioned blockchain. With decentralization,
    you have geographic diversity among validators, which takes you to 100 milliseconds
    if you restrict yourself to one hemisphere. It will always be a price follower
    for coins listed on CEXs, so its market makers will be scalped just like they
    are on AMMs. However, their select market makers will make money, but not for
    the reasons they state. [As for the unlisted coins, there is no need for speed,
    as they are less correlated with the big two that move secondary crypto coins
    around (ETH and BTC). The only people who should be market making shit coins are
    their insiders]

  zh: Yan说，由于AMMs中的暂时性损失问题，他决定在自己的L1上构建一个交易所。我同意Uniswap的AMMs是不可持续的，因为它们会因为这个开支而损失更多的钱，但是区块链上的CLOBs并不是解决方案。即使是一个快速的L1，在CEXs仍然会很慢，因为其为集中化，而且同一地域的服务器可以在5微秒内响应交易信息。一个集中式的L1是毫无意义的，就像一个私有的有权限的区块链一样。去中心化可以让验证者拥有地理多样性，这会让你只限于一个半球时，响应时间就会达到100毫秒。它将永远是CEXs上币种的价格追随者，因此它的做市商就像在AMMs上一样会被割，然而它们精选的做市商会赚钱，并非他们所说的原因。[至于未上市的币种，速度并不是必要的，因为它们与推动次级加密货币的两大加密货币（ETH和BTC）的相关性较低。市场做市次级货币的人是他们的内部人员]
- en: The main problem with a dapp-specific L1 is that the chain validators and the
    protocol are equal partners, as the gas and trade fees all support that one dapp.
    The incentives of the DEX and L1 insiders are perfectly aligned, so insider collusion
    is the default assumption. They probably give insiders a latency advantage by
    giving them effective co-location, and prioritization in sequencing transactions
    within a block. However, as officially a decentralized L1, this would be unacknowledged. 
    As LP cancellations are explicitly prioritized over trades, the Hyperlink insiders
    can make consistent money-making markets, unlike in Uniswap.

  zh: dapp特定L1的主要问题在于链验证者和协议是平等的合作伙伴，因为加密和交易费用都支持该dapp。DEX和L1内部人员的激励完全一致，因此内部勾结是默认的假设。他们可能通过给予他们有效的共同位置和在区块内对交易进行优先排序来给内部人员优势。然而，正式上是一个去中心化的L1，这是不被承认的。由于LP取消交易明确优先于交易，Hyperlink内部人员可以进行一致的盈利市场，不像Uniswap。
- en: Hyperlink conspicuously claims to be decentralized. Yet they currently have
    centralized control over their L1 validators, bridge, their oracle, and whoever
    is running their primary market-making strategy (currently working *pro bono*
    because that's what trustless anonymous crypto insiders do!). They restrict IP
    access to avoid US regulators, which would not be possible on a genuinely decentralized
    dapp. While Binance and Bitmex almost surely have insiders making their markets
    with privileged access, they at least have the decency not to pretend these are
    decentralized exchanges.

- en: Its disingenuous design encourages the worst in crypto, which is saying something.
    For example, it wasn't until SBF created his unregulated offshore exchange FTX
    that things took off for SBF. He claimed to be trading $300MM/day when he approached
    VCs for funding in July 2019, though you won't find more than a handful of mentions
    about their exchange on Reddit or other forums where people talk about their crypto
    activities. FTX released a White Paper on how many crypto exchanges were faking
    volume to boost interest, which is a great way to learn about these tactics—and
    what not to do—and disarm people who might accuse you of faking your trading metrics.
    As we now know, SBF and his team were like [Alex Mashinsky](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/celsius-alex-mashinsky-charged-with-fraud/index.html#:~:text=US%20prosecutors%20charged%20the%20former,wire%20fraud%20and%20commodities%20fraud.),
    liars who emphasized their unique integrity and decentralization, making them
    safer and morally superior to his competitors. We should not be surprised that
    SBF and Mashinsky moved on to stealing customer funds to gamble on shit coins
    because that's what liars do, like the [scorpion on the frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog);

  zh: 它虚伪的设计鼓励了加密货币中最糟糕的行为，这说得也不为过。例如，直到SBF创建了他的未受监管的离岸交易平台FTX之后，SBF的事业才快速发展。他声称在2019年7月接触风险投资公司寻求资金支持时每天交易金额为3亿美元，然而在Reddit或其他论坛上很难找到有关他们交易平台的提及，而这些平台通常是人们讨论加密货币活动的场所。FTX发布了一份白皮书，介绍了许多加密交易所如何伪造交易量以提高兴趣的做法，这是了解这些策略的好方法，同时也了解不应该做的事情，并可以使那些可能指责您伪造交易数据的人感到无力。正如我们现在所知，SBF及其团队就像[亚历克斯·马辛斯基](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/celsius-alex-mashinsky-charged-with-fraud/index.html#:~:text=US%20prosecutors%20charged%20the%20former,wire%20fraud%20and%20commodities%20fraud.)一样，强调其独特的诚信和去中心化，使其比竞争对手更安全，道德上更有优势。我们不应该感到惊讶SBF和Mashinsky转而盗取客户资金来投机贬值货币，因为这正是说谎者的本性，就像[蛙上的蝎子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog)；这是他们的天性。
- en: Their L1 does not have a native token, so it just takes USDC collateral from
    Arbitrum to bridge to their chain. Users thus have the hacking risk of the Arbitrum
    and Hyperlink bridge and worry about USDC censorship (if you get flagged, your
    USDC is effectively zeroed out). With just their trusted version of USDC, the
    famously fraudulent perp finance rate is the only mechanism that ties their perp
    prices to spot prices on off-chain assets. Yan mentioned this was discovered in
    trad-fi, indicating he probably heard stories about how Nobel Laureate Robert
    Shiller introduced a different version in 1991\. He probably does not realize
    that the Bitmex perp/spot funding rate mechanism is nothing like Shiller's perpetual
    real-estate futures contract, which, in any case, never caught on in trad-fi because
    it was fatally flawed. Many perps work fine without the perp/spot funding rate
    ruse, highlighting its irrelevance. The perp funding rate mechanism is just an
    excuse to comfort traders to believe these perp prices are not mere Shelling points
    but are tied down by arbitrage (see [here](https://efalken.substack.com/p/perp-funding-rates-dont-do-what-they)
    for more on that).

  zh: 他们的L1没有本地代币，因此它只是从Arbitrum中获取USDC抵押品，以便桥接到自己的链上。因此，用户存在着Arbitrum和Hyperlink桥的黑客风险，并担心USDC的审查制度（如果您被标记，您的USDC将被归零）。仅凭他们信任的版本的USDC，以太坊上的假冒金融率成为了唯一将其永续价格与链下资产现货价格联系在一起的机制。Yan提到这是在传统金融领域被发现的，表明他可能听说过诺贝尔奖得主罗伯特·席勒于1991年推出了一种不同版本。他可能没有意识到Bitmex的永续/现货资金费率机制与席勒的永续房地产期货合同完全不同，而且无论如何，在传统金融领域都未受欢迎，因为它存在致命缺陷。许多永续合约在没有永续/现货资金费率诡计的情况下也能正常运行，突显出其不相关性。永续合约资金费率机制只是一种借口，让交易者相信这些永续价格不仅仅是谢林点，而是通过套利稳定的（更多信息请见[此处](https://efalken.substack.com/p/perp-funding-rates-dont-do-what-they)）。
