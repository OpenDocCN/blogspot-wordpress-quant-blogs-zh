- en: I'm typically averse to maintaining long positions in strongly overbought markets
    or short positions in strongly oversold markets. Being long in an overbought market,
    or short and oversold market, can carry a high level of risk since market reversals
    under such conditions can be sharp. Mean reversion traders strictly abide by this
    philosophy as they look to take advantage of stretched conditions and then exit
    once conditions revert to a more normal state. For instance they might look to
    buy a short-term low and then exit the trade on a moved back up through a short-term
    moving average. This can be a solid approach, especially if you also factor in
    the long-term trend of the market.

  zh: 我通常不愿意在强烈超额买入的市场中维持多头头寸或在强烈超额卖出的市场中维持空头头寸。在超买市场持有多头头寸，或者在超卖市场持有空头头寸，由于市场在这种情况下的逆转可能很剧烈，因此风险很高。均值回归交易者严格遵循这一理念，他们寻找利用拉伸状况，然后在状况回归到更正常状态时退出。例如，他们可能会寻找短期低点，然后当价格回升至短期移动平均线以上时退出交易。这是一种可靠的方法，尤其是如果你还考虑了市场的长期趋势。
- en: My approach is a little bit different. Rather than comparing the market’s price
    to a mean or measuring overbought/oversold with an oscillator, I compare recent
    price action to recent expectations based on estimates provided by my studies.
    This typically allows me to get long easier if my studies are suggesting an upside
    bias, and allows me to get short easier if my studies are suggesting a downside
    bias. At the same time it protects me from entering a position in the direction
    of a move that is already strongly overdone.

  zh: 我的方法有点不同。我不是将市场的价格与平均值相比较，或者使用振荡器来衡量超买/超卖，而是将最近的价格行动与近期基于我的研究提供的估计进行比较。这通常使我如果研究暗示有上升倾向时更容易建立多头头寸，如果研究暗示有下降倾向时更容易建立空头头寸。同时，这也保护我不进入一个已经在强烈超额交易的方向上的头寸。
- en: Let me provide a brief example to better explain. Assume that over the last
    three days the estimates from my studies suggested that the market should be up
    a total of 1%. If over that period of time the market rises 2% then I consider
    it overbought and too risky to hold a long position, even if my estimates for
    the next few days are for further upside. But if instead the market has only risen
    0.75% while my estimates suggested it should be up 1%, then it would not be overbought
    and I could continue to maintain my long position. And if my estimates were for
    1% up, and the market had declined, there again a long position would be justified.
    The combination of an underperforming market with positive expectations or a market
    that has outperformed and has negative expectations is a combination that I want
    to hold a position.

  zh: 让我举一个简短的例子来更好地解释。假设在过去的三天里，我的研究估计市场应该总共上涨1%。如果在那段时间内市场上涨了2%，那么我认为它已经超买，持有多头头寸风险太大，即使我对未来几天内的估计是进一步上涨。但是，如果市场实际上只上涨了0.75%，而我的估计是上涨1%，那么它就不会超买，我可以继续维持我的多头头寸。如果我的估计是上涨1%，而市场下跌，那么持有多头头寸也是有道理的。表现不佳的市场与积极预期相结合，或者表现优于市场的负面预期，是我想要持仓的组合。
- en: Some recent long signals provide nice examples of instances where a classic
    mean reversion approach would have to be flat or short, but I was able to maintain
    a long position. For most of the early December my studies suggested an upside
    bias. I was quickly taken out of my long position, though, as the SPX became extremely
    overbought early in the month. On December 15th the market pulled back for the
    first time in over a week and a long signal triggered. The next day the SPX reversed
    sharply and closed at a new high. In doing so it would've meant an exit for any
    classic mean reversion strategy. But despite the new high, the SPX was still considered
    "underperforming" versus expectations over the last few days. For me this meant
    I could continue to hold, or even establish new long positions. On the 17th the
    SPX again closed at a new high, but again it was considered underperforming versus
    my recent expectations. It wasn't until the 20th when the SPX was making its third
    new high in a row that my measurement suggested the short-term move up was getting
    too overheated and it was time to take profits. Even that exit was early as the
    market continued upward for two more days. My studies remained bullish and my
    next long signal occurred on December 27th despite the market closing up for the
    day and only one point shy of another new high.

  zh: 最近一些较长的信号提供了很好的例子，说明了在哪些情况下经典均值回归方法必须保持平坦或空头立场，但我能够维持多头头寸。在十二月初的大部分时间里，我的研究暗示存在上行倾向。然而，随着标普500指数（SPX）在本月初早期极度超买，我很快就被迫平仓。12月15日，市场在一周多以来首次回调，并触发了一个长期信号。第二天，SPX大幅逆转并收盘于新的高点。这样做意味着任何经典均值回归策略都需要退出。但尽管创下了新高，但SPX仍被认为在过去几天内的表现“低于预期”。对我来说，这意味着我可以继续持有，甚至可以建立新的多头头寸。在17日，SPX再次收盘于新的高点，但与我最近预期的相比，它仍然表现不佳。直到20日，当SPX连续第三天创下新高时，我的测量才表明短期上涨过于过热，是时候获利了。即便如此，退出时机还是早了，因为市场又上涨了两天。我的研究保持看涨，我的下一个长期信号发生在12月27日，尽管市场当天收盘上涨，并且仅比另一个新高低了一个点。
- en: The purpose of this is not to discuss my trade triggers in any detail but rather
    to share the idea that overbought/oversold can 1) be incorporated to help reduce
    risk and 2) be looked at a number of different ways. When I determine my position
    size I consider both the strength of my current open studies, and the degree that
    the market is overbought or oversold versus recent expectations. While you may
    not track studies and generate estimates in the same way I do, you should still
    consider adjusting your overbought/oversold measures based on market conditions
    and/or your current and recent outlook.

  zh: 这里的目的不是详细讨论我的交易触发器，而是分享一个观点：超买/超卖可以 1）被纳入以帮助降低风险，2）以多种不同的方式来观察。当我确定我的头寸大小时，我会考虑我当前开放研究的强度，以及市场相对于近期预期的超买或超卖程度。虽然你可能不会像我这样跟踪研究和产生估计，但你仍然应该根据市场状况以及你当前和最近的观点，调整你的超买/超卖指标。
