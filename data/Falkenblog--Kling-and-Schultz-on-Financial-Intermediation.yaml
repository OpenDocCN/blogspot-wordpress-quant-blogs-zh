- en: In the last section of the book, however, I found their general description
    of finance to have a misleading emphasis. There was an exposition where assets
    have risk characteristics that are obscured as they are passed up a food chain,
    until finally there is greater liquidity, but less information available. Risk
    is transferred, but because of the lack of transparency, it actually increases.

  zh: 然而，在这本书的最后一节，我发现他们对金融的一般描述过于强调了。书中描述了一种情况，资产的风险特征在通过一层又一层的食物链传递时变得模糊，直到最后有更大的流动性，但可用信息却更少了。风险被转移，但由于缺乏透明度，事实上它却增加了。
- en: Clearly, there is transferral of risk in finance, but I think this is not the
    essence of finance. Finance is intermediation, taking money from savers and giving
    to people who want to use that money. They, in turn, promise to pay it back. The
    process generates prices that act as signals to inform those borrowers and savers
    how best to borrow or save.

  zh: 很明显，金融中存在风险的转移，但我认为这并不是金融的本质。金融是中介，将钱从储蓄者那里拿来交给想要使用这笔钱的人。而这些人则承诺将其还回来。这个过程产生了价格，作为信号通知那些借款者和储蓄者借款或储蓄的最佳方式。
- en: 'Yet, fundamentally, much finance can be considered one of five forms: marketmaking,
    clearing, originating, servicing, and warehousing. These specializations make
    for different focus by various firms, so that things important to one set of financial
    institutions are often irrelevant for another, and ''risk'' means different things
    to different parties, because the risk they retain have different characteristics.'

- en: These 5 attributes of finance are complements, and so many firms have overlapping

    in the process of warehousing, buying equities or debt and bundling them into
    portfolios. As the ultimate owners, these warehousers hold most of the value of
    the investment, yet, some of the value must be apportioned to each, necessary
    part of the financial process, and so servicers, clearing firms, market makers,
    and originators receive some of the money, often a fixed transaction cost. It
    is wise to keep originators honest, and servicers diligent, by having them retain
    some of the residual risk of any investment.

  zh: 这些金融的5个属性是互补的，所以许多公司的功能是重叠的。然而，有些公司专门从事仓储业务，购买股票或债务，并将它们捆绑成投资组合。作为最终所有者，这些仓储商持有大部分投资的价值，但一些价值必须分配给每个金融流程的必要部分，所以服务商、清算公司、市场制造商和原始贷款人会收到一些钱，通常是固定交易成本。通过让原始贷款人和服务商承担一些投资的剩余风险，可以让他们保持诚实和勤奋。
- en: This does not contradict the idea of financial intermediation as risk transfer,
    yet it highlights the fact that the basic risks that are kept away from the warehousing
    are generally those that are presumed to disappear. A good originator, or servicer,
