    began to descend in 2012, fear of a hard landing permeated financial markets for
    several months. My view on a soft landing was based on the dominance of bank loans
    in credit creation. The country's banks are government-owned. When property developers
    face a liquidity crunch, the banks are likely to reschedule their loans. A hard
    landing is a consequence of the snowball effect from creditors liquidating delinquent
    borrowers. When there is a big bubble funded by debt, as is usually the case,
    its bursting would lead to a hard landing if the credit agreements are stuck to.
    Hence, a soft landing is usually due to either an inability or unwillingness of
    creditors to enforce debt contracts. Japan, for example, was in such a situation
    in the 1990s.

    the inflation difference and the former's depreciation. Similarly, when two bonds
    have different interest rates, the difference reflects their different bankruptcy
    probability. Because currency depreciation and corporate bankruptcy happen infrequently,

    rate differences.
