- en: With the favorable response I received on two recent posts, [Edward Hugh and
    a Fistful of Euros](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/edward-hugh-and-fistful-of-euros.html)
    and [Market Psych Offers Language-Based Fear Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/market-psych-offers-language-based-fear.html),
    I thought it might be a good time to highlight the work of another blogger who
    I believe deserves a wider audience and whose content nicely complements what
    readers can find here.

  zh: 由于我在最近两篇博文上收到了积极的反馈，[Edward Hugh and a Fistful of Euros](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/edward-hugh-and-fistful-of-euros.html)和[Market
    Psych Offers Language-Based Fear Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/market-psych-offers-language-based-fear.html)，我认为现在是时候突出介绍另一位我认为值得更广泛关注的博主，其内容与这里读者能找到的内容相得益彰。
- en: The blogger is Rohan Clarke and his blog is known as [Data Diary](http://www.datadiary.com.au/)
    and also carries the tag line, “An investor’s diary of economic data, corporate
    earnings and market sentiment.” While Clarke is based in Australia, his posts
    betray a broad range of geographical and intellectual interests. His latest missive,
    from earlier today, [Betting on Zero](http://www.datadiary.com.au/2010/12/15/betting-on-zero/),
    tackles inexpensive portfolio hedges, the VIX and [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratios.

  zh: 博主是Rohan Clarke，他的博客名为[Data Diary](http://www.datadiary.com.au/)，口号是“投资者的经济数据、公司盈利和市场情绪日记”。虽然Clarke位于澳大利亚，但他的博文显示出广泛的地理和智力兴趣。他今天早些时候的最新博文[Betting
    on Zero](http://www.datadiary.com.au/2010/12/15/betting-on-zero/)讨论了低成本的投资对冲、VIX以及[看跌期权/看涨期权](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)比率。
- en: For another insightful blog from Down Under, readers might also wish to check
    out [billy blog](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/), where I can guarantee
    that Bill Mitchell’s take on the global economy and economic issues in Australia
    will give you something to think about, whether you agree with his perspective
    or not.

    Mitchell）对全球经济以及澳大利亚经济问题的看法会令你深思，无论你是否同意他的观点。
