    the mortgage support. This is a very complex set of favors that allow all sorts
    of butt-covering. Often, the house price is inflated by precisely the amount of
    the 'gift' (around 5%), so this is just a small little escrow for the builder.

  zh: 房屋建筑商向非营利机构捐赠这样的款项，然后才有资格获得抵押贷款支持。这是一系列非常复杂的恩惠，可以让各种各样的人得到好处。通常，房屋价格会被“礼物”的金额精确地膨胀（约为
    5%），因此这只是给房屋建筑商的一个小小的托管款。《华尔街日报》

    agencies involved in so much of this, it really defies credulity to think 'more
    regulation' would have prevented the crisis, as opposed to making it worse. While
    the FHA does not allow this practice, it still provides loans for people who merely
    have 3% of the house price to put into a down payment! For those arguing for 'more'
    regulation, does that mean more of these loans?
