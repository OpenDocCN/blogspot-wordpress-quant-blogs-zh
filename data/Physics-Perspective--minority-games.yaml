    What happens in the market is assumed to reflect the interplay of two things:
    1\. the decisions of countless market participants who act more or less rationally
    in their best interests, their actions collectively bringing the market toward
    a balance in which stocks, bonds, or other instruments take their realistic "fundamental"
    values (or at least something close to those values), and 2\. external shocks
    that hit the market in the form of new pieces of information concerning businesses,
    political events, changes in regulations, technological discoveries and so on.
    Without shocks from outside, these models imply, the market would settle down
    (very rapidly it is assumed) into an unchanging state. Everything that happens
    in the market, this perspective asserts, can be traced to new information perturbing
    that balance.'

    way to play; intelligent play requires perpetual adaptation and learning. The
    minority game is probably the simplest mathematical model of a market in this

    it is, at least, a toy model looks a lot more like real markets than does the

    would be miserable if more than 60% attended. The minority game simplifies the
    cutoff to 50%, giving symmetry to the problem -- now the people who do well on
    any week are those who act so as to be in the minority (going when most others
    stay home, and vice versa). The minority game also dispenses with the story of
    the bar. Just let each N agents on each play choose either 1 or -1, with those
    in the minority gaining some payoff (let N be odd). Now let them play many times.
    Each agent just goes along trying each time to be in the minority. How does one

    -1s -- these giving the winning choices that would have been in the minority in
    each instance. For example, the last 5 outcomes might be 1,1,-1,-1,1\. A "strategy"
    in the minority game associates every such recent history with a choice of what
    to do next -- a choice of 1 or -1\. A strategy may say that IF (1,1,-1,-1,1) THEN
    choose 1, or instead IF (1,1,-1,-1,1) THEN choose -1\. If we suppose that agents

    to think" about how to predict the world. (The interesting properties of the model
    do not depend on this choice.) Agents use these strategies to play the game, and
    keep track of which strategies seem to work well, and which ones don't. This is
    generally done through some simple algorithm wherein each strategy in an agent's
    bag gains a point when it makes a good prediction, and gets docked a point if
    it predicts incorrectly. On each play, the agents look into their bag and play
    the strategy with the highest score. This is like a person mulling over the various
    theories in their head, and using the one that seems to have been most successful
    in the past.

- en: So that's it. You have a collection of agents using simple learning dynamics
    to try to predict the future based on the past. They try at each moment to choose
    what most others will not choose. Clearly no one strategy can emerge as the winner,
    because if it did and everyone started using it then they would all be in the
    majority, and all be losers. Successful strategies, therefore, sow the seeds of
    their own demise. This is what makes the game interesting. But wait -- how is

    in which each person tries to profit by choosing the right strategy, but where
    what is "right" is determined by the collective actions of everyone together.
    There is no "right" independent of what others do. The minority game, like any

- en: We get the simplest crude model of a market if we think of those choosing 1
    as "buyers"  and those choosing -1 as "sellers" of some stock. Naturally, more
    buyers than sellers drives a price up, and an imbalance the other way drives it
    down. Mathematically, you can take the change in the logarithm of the price (the
    return) at time t as being proportional to Number(buyers) - Number(sellers). The
    resulting price has a highly erratic behaviour that very roughly resembles the
    movements of financial markets. In particular, even without any external information
    hitting the market, no shocks from outside or perturbations of any kind, the price
    fluctuates up and down unpredictably merely through the perpetual evolution of
    the agents' trading strategies. One day, apparently caused by nothing, the price
    may suddenly drop by 10% -- all because many agents chose to sell just as a part

    so-called "stylized facts" of real markets -- the fat tailed statistics of return
    distributions, and the long memory and persistence of market volatility. In fact,
    the returns for this simplest minority game market are Gaussian, at least when
    the number of players is large. However, this model is only a beginning, and these
    stylized facts emerge quite naturally as soon as one includes a few more realistic
    features. For example, in this version of the game, every agent must either choose
    1 (buy) or -1 (sell) at each moment. Hence, the volume of trading is always the
    same; it is forced to be fixed, which is of course completely unnatural.

  zh: 1. 少数派游戏市场最简单的版本 **并不产生** 真实市场的所谓“风格化事实”——收益分布的厚尾统计，以及市场波动的长期记忆和持续性。事实上，当玩家数量较大时，这个最简单的少数派游戏市场的收益是高斯分布。然而，这个模型只是一个开始，一旦包括了几个更现实的特征，这些风格化的事实就会非常自然地出现。例如，在这个游戏的版本中，每个代理人在每个时刻都必须选择
    1（买入）或 -1（卖出）。因此，成交量总是相同的；它被强制固定，这当然是完全不自然的。
- en: An easy way to relax this is to give the agents the ability also to abstain
    -- they might just hold what they have, neither buying or selling. This can be
    included with some measure of confidence, whereby an agent doesn't trade unless
    one of its strategies has been very successful in the recent past. This immediately
    leads to a market with fluctuations in volume, and this market does turn out to
    have stylized facts much like those of real markets, with fat tailed returns and
    long memory. Another way to allow for a fluctuating volume is to let the agents
    accrue wealth over time, and let the volume of their trading grow in proportion
    to that wealth. Again, this is an obvious step toward reality, and again leads
    to market fluctuations with many of the rich statistical features seen in real
    markets, even in such simple models.

  zh: 放松这个条件的一个简单方法是赋予代理人也放弃的权利——他们可能只是持有他们所拥有的，既不买也不卖。这可以有一定的信心包含在内，即除非代理人的某一个策略在最近过去非常成功，否则代理人不进行交易。这立即导致了一个成交量波动的市场，这个市场确实具有与真实市场类似的“风格化事实”，即收益分布的厚尾和市场波动的长记忆。允许成交量波动的另一种方法是让代理人在一段时间内积累财富，并让他们的交易量与他们积累的财富成比例增长。同样，这是走向现实的明显一步，同样导致具有许多真实市场所见到的丰富统计特征的市场波动，即使是在如此简单的模型中。

    can be solved with some analytical techniques borrowed from physics. The details
    aren't so important, but the results show a fascinating behaviour in the market

- en: The basic story is that one key parameter in the minority game determines its
    overall character. The parameter is α=P/N, where N is the number of agents in
    the game. If this is small, then there are lots of players relative to the number
    of different market histories they can perceive. If this is big, then there are
    many different possible histories relative to only a few people. These two extremes
    lead to very different market behaviour and it's not hard to see why.

- en: The figure below (from the Galla et al paper) shows what is effectively the
    market predictability as a function of this parameter α=P/N. In other words, this
    shows how much a past record of prices can be used to make accurate predictions
    of future prices. For large α, this predictability is positive, and it grows as
    α grows. Why? In principle, this kind of predictability ought to make for easy
    success in the game. But only if the agents' have enough flexibility in their
    behaviour to pounce on the pattern and exploit it. In this regime, it happens
    frequently that patterns emerge in the prices and yet no agent has the intellectual
    capacity to exploit it. Recall that each individual is given a random set of strategies
    to work with. With very few people in the market, that means very few strategies
    relative to the many possible market histories on which the agents make their
    decisions. In short, if the diversity of agents and their behavioural strategies
    is insufficient to let them jump on all possible patterns, the market retains
    a degree of predictability.

  zh: 下面的图表（来自Galla等人论文）有效地展示了市场可预测性作为参数α=P/N的函数。换句话说，这个图表显示了过去价格记录可以用来准确预测未来价格的程度。对于大的α，这种可预测性是正的，并且随着α的增大而增长。为什么？从原则上讲，这种可预测性应该使游戏中的成功变得容易。但只有当代理的行为足够灵活，能够抓住模式并利用它时才成立。在这种状态下，价格中经常出现模式，然而却没有代理有足够的智力能力去利用它。回想一下，每个个体都被随机给定了一组策略来操作。在市场中人数非常少时，这意味着相对于代理做出决策的许多可能的市历史，策略非常少。简而言之，如果代理及其行为策略的多样性不足以让他们抓住所有可能的模式，市场就会保持一定程度的可预测性。

    oversupply of agents and strategies in play relative to the number of discernible
    histories. Now it is very likely that any predictable pattern will suit some agent's
    bag of strategies, and that agent will jump on it, profit, and their activity
    will tend to wipe out that pattern. This phase looks rather like the efficient
    market -- such a rich diversity of agents with different skills and mindsets that
    any predictable patterns are immediately washed away.

  zh: 对于另一个极端情况，当α很小时，情况看起来非常不同。现在我们有相对于可识别历史数量的代理和策略过剩。现在很可能会有一种可预测的模式适合某个代理的策略组合，该代理将会抓住这个模式，获利，并且他们的活动倾向于抹掉这种模式。这个阶段看起来很像有效市场——如此丰富的代理多样性，拥有不同的技能和心态，任何可预测的模式都会立即被冲走。

- en: emerging from this picture is that real markets are probably something like
    "marginally efficient", at least much of the time. If fully efficient and hence
    unpredictable (many agents in the market, low α), then it's very hard to make
    profits in the market. This should make the market less attractive and some people
    should leave to do something else. But as the number of people falls, this pushed
    the market toward higher α and into the inefficient phase in which the market
    becomes predictable. This should in turn attract more people into the market to
    profit from easy patterns. In this simple picture, the market should tend to evolved
    toward a value of α where the predictability of prices is low but not zero, making
    it hard but not impossible to find patterns in the market. This is, judging in
    a loose non-scientific way, just about where markets often seem to be.

  zh: 从这幅图中可以看出，真实的市场可能类似于“边际有效”，至少在大部分时间里是这样。如果完全有效且因此不可预测（市场中有许多代理，α较低），那么在市场中获利非常困难。这应该使市场变得不那么有吸引力，有些人应该离开去做其他事情。但随着人数的减少，这推动了市场向更高的α值发展，并进入低效阶段，市场变得可预测。这反过来又吸引了更多的人进入市场，从容易的模式中获利。在这幅简单的图中，市场应该倾向于向一个α值发展，其中价格的可预测性低但不为零，这使得在市场中找到模式困难但并非不可能。从宽松的非科学角度来看，市场似乎经常处于这样的位置。
- en: Works on the minority game now number on the thousands, and I only wanted to
    get across the most basic points. It's a beautiful simple model that captures
    a great deal of the qualitative character of markets, and with further changes
    can be taken step by step toward more sophisticated models of markets. There's
    no reason to stick to idea that payoff go to those in the minority. The game has
    generalized, for example, to majority type games (where  trend following pays
    off) or mixed majority-minority games (where market reversion and trend following
    both play a role). A few steps further and you can forget the game itself and
    simply model markets as systems in which people interact with various trading
    strategies, each buying and selling, and where prices move through their collective
    action. Lots of models study a simple mixture of fundamentalists, who try to trade
    on the base of real information about stocks, and trend followers who ride the
    momentum. Computing power and imagination present the only limits.

  zh: 目前研究少数派游戏的文章已经不下数千篇，而我只想传达最基本的概念。这是一个优美的简单模型，它能捕捉市场的许多定性特征，并且可以通过进一步的改变逐步向更复杂的市场模型发展。没有必要坚持认为收益总是归于少数派。这个游戏已经推广到了其他类型，例如多数派游戏（其中趋势跟随能带来收益）或者混合多数派-少数派游戏（其中市场回归和趋势跟随都发挥作用）。再进一步，你就可以忘记游戏本身，仅仅将市场建模为人们运用各种交易策略相互作用的系统，每个人都在买卖，而价格则通过他们的集体行动而变动。计算能力和想象力是唯一的限制。
- en: I'm going to explore some of these more sophisticated models in future, but
    the minority game remains extremely important precisely because of its simplicity.
    That simplicity allows full analysis leading to the picture of two phases shown
    above. But this is already considerably more complex than market models based
    on assumed fully rational behaviour. It's crude, very much so, but a small step
    in the right direction.

  zh: 我将来会探索这些更复杂的模型，但少数派游戏之所以极其重要，正是因为其简单性。这种简单性使得我们可以进行完整的分析，得出上面所示的两个阶段的图像。但这已经比基于假设的完全理性行为的市场模型复杂得多。这个模型很粗糙，确实如此，但它是在正确方向上的一个小步骤。
