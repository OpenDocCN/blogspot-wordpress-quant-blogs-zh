- en: Which would you rather do? Work for a big Wall Street Investment bank, be guaranteed
    a good salary and (in good times), a decent bonus that might make you the envy
    of your neighborhood (unless you live in Short Hills, NJ or Greenwich, Ct), or
    work for a small, technically-savvy software company where you can be directly
    responsible for the bottom line?

  zh: 你更愿意选择哪一种？在华尔街一家大型投资银行工作，保证获得一份不错的薪水（在好时光里），可能让你成为邻居羡慕的对象（除非你住在新泽西州的Short Hills或康涅狄格州的Greenwich），还是在一家小型、技术娴熟的软件公司工作，在那里你可以直接对底线负责？

  zh: 最近，我工作的这家大投资银行的同事（让我们称他为T）面临了这样的选择。
- en: T is one of the top performance architects on Wall Street, and has personally
    been instrumental at improving the performance of several of our key systems.
    For various reasons, T felt that he wanted to explore some other opportunities,
    and within a few weeks, he had a few job and consulting offers. The fact that
    he could be so successful in his job search in this kind of market speaks volumes
    about his talent.

  zh: T 是华尔街顶尖的性能架构师之一，个人在提高我们几个关键系统的性能方面发挥了重要作用。由于各种原因，T 感觉他想要探索其他机会，几周后，他就有了几份工作和咨询邀请。在这种市场环境下，他在求职中能取得如此成功，充分说明了他的才华。
- en: The position that T was going to accept was as a W-2 consultant with another
    large investment bank whose troubles have been in the news lately. T had never
    consulted before, so he had asked me a lot of questions about what it was like
    to be a consultant. Between the fact that T was new to consulting, only had a
    one-year contract, and was involved with an Investment Bank whose management was
    said to be a bit befuldled, I preferred to see T end up in another place. If this
    Investment Bank were to lay off additional consulting staff in the future, T would
    probably be one of the first ones to go. The Investment bank would have probably
    given T a small chunk of money to buy off the rest of the contract, and then T
    would have found himself back out on the street.

  zh: T即将接受的职位是在一家最近麻烦不断的大型投资银行担任W-2顾问。T以前从未做过咨询，所以他对咨询的生活问了我很多问题。考虑到T是咨询行业的新手，只有一份一年的合同，而且所在的投资银行管理据说有些混乱，我更希望看到T去别的地方。如果这家投资银行将来解雇更多的咨询人员，T很可能是首批被解雇的人之一。投资银行可能会给T一小笔钱来买断剩余的合同，然后T就会发现自己又回到了街头。
- en: Coincidentally, a week before T was to resign from my firm, the CEO of one of
    the Complex Event Processing vendors contacted me to ask me if I knew anyone who
    would be available for a new position that his company had opened. Immediately,
    I thought of T. He was on his way out the door anyway, so I felt OK about referring
    him to the CEP vendor. Within two days, T had a third offer, and after another
    day, T inked the deal with the CEP vendor!

  zh: 巧合的是，在T准备从我的公司辞职前一周，一家复杂事件处理供应商的首席执行官联系我，问我是否认识谁可以担任他们公司新开设的职位。我立刻想到了T。T反正也要离开，所以我感觉推荐他去CEP供应商是可以的。两天后，T有了第三份工作邀请，又过了一天，T与CEP供应商达成了协议！
- en: I spent quite a bit of time with T to help him through his array of choices.
    Almost every decision point favored joining the CEP vendor. The CEP vendor is
    certainly not a start-up, as they have been around for a few years and have about
    60 people working for them, but it certainly has the feel of a start-up (sans
    the foozball table and loft in Silicon Alley).

  zh: 我花了大量时间帮助T梳理他的各种选择。几乎每一个决策点都倾向于加入CEP供应商。CEP供应商绝非初创公司，因为他们已经运营几年，有大约60人在为他们工作，但确实有着初创公司的氛围（不过没有硅谷式的足球桌和阁楼）。
