    unpleasant side effect of making a clear conclusion obvious. In a perfect world,
    the observed trading strategy distribution would come from a normal distribution
    and the distribution shape and mean would never change. However, even in such
    a perfect world, we cannot accurately model and evaluate  such a system if the
    trade distribution is not independent. A normal distribution makes this very assumption–that
    if one win’s on a recent trade, there is no linkage to the probability that one
    will win on a subsequent trade.  This makes everything like a roulette wheel where
    we can try martingale strategies (doubling down on a given color after a loss)
    but will never change the odds of winning/losing but rather the shape of profits
    and losses.  Effectively we can create option-like payoffs by manipulating our
    bet size based on the previous profit or loss but will not accomplish the task
    of changing the expected value.

  zh: 在系统评估中要考虑一个重要因素，它有一个不愉快的副作用，那就是使得得出明确结论变得明显。在一个完美的世界中，观察到的交易策略分布将来自正态分布，分布的形状和均值将永远不会改变。然而，即使在这个完美的世界中，如果交易分布不是独立的，我们也不能准确地建模和评估这样的系统。正态分布正是基于这样一个假设——如果在最近一次交易中获胜，那么与随后一次交易获胜的概率没有关联。这使得一切就像轮盘赌一样，我们可以尝试马丁格尔策略（在亏损后在给定颜色上加倍下注），但这永远不会改变赢/输的概率，而只是改变利润和亏损的形状。有效地，我们可以通过根据之前的盈亏操纵我们的下注大小来创建类似期权的收益，但不会完成改变预期价值的任务。
- en: The market is a far different beast that is driven at rapid speeds by computer
    generated liquidity, and the emotions of the masses. It is an environment that
    creates self-reinforcing feedback loops that can periodically generate substantial
    auto-correlation (read:trending) in returns. The tendency for mean-reversion or
    follow-through itself is a form of dependency that would not be expected if the
    series of daily returns were random. Stepping away from these obvious points,
    is that different trading strategies whether short-term or long-term, trending
    or mean-reversion, will have a tendency to have either a correlated or un-correlated
    trade series. Part of the correlation in this trade series is driven by the market
    macro and micro-structure, while some of the correlation is idiosyncratic. It
    is up to the trader to figure out which is which.

  zh: 市场是一头由计算机生成的流动性驱动的、速度极快的野兽，它还受到大众情绪的影响。它是一个能产生自我强化反馈循环的环境，这种循环有时会在回报中产生显著的自相关性（即：趋势性）。均值回归或趋势持续的倾向本身是一种依赖形式，如果日回报序列是随机的，这种依赖是意想不到的。离开这些显而易见的问题，不同交易策略无论短期还是长期、趋势跟随还是均值回归，都倾向于具有相关或无关的交易序列。交易序列中的相关性部分是由市场宏观和微观结构驱动的，而一些相关性是特异的。交易者需要搞清楚哪一个是哪一个是哪一种。
- en: However, the effect that a correlated trade series has on system evaluation
    is that it can cause you to systematically overstate or understate your analysis
    of the short-term performance of the system. Imagine for a second that I was short-sighted
    and looked at the past 5 trades of an indicator or system to determine its usefulness.
    I watch closely, and  4 out of 5 are winners– fantastic, sign me up! I look at
    the long-term performance of the system or indicator, and it has a very good track
    record—again this bodes very well right? Well, not if you are trading many short-term
    mean-reversion systems, in this case exceptional short-term performance is especially
    bad for the next trade. This is because the series of trades is often negatively
    correlated. This also has the side effect of distorting the ability to “turn-off”
    the equity curve of the system, because ultimately doing so requires a clear trend
    signal. We would have to strip the correlation effect out of the system in order
    to clean up the signals. Note that in some types of systems, the trade returns
    are positively correlated, and you have the reverse effect happening. Winners
    follow winners and losers follow losers. This type of system lends itself very
    well to using a traditional equity curve based system.

  zh: 然而，相关交易序列对系统评估的影响是，它可能会导致你系统性地高估或低估你对系统短期性能的分析。想象一下，如果我只看一个指标或系统过去的5笔交易来判断它的有效性。我仔细观察，发现其中4笔是盈利的——太棒了，让我加入吧！我查看该系统或指标的长期表现，它有着非常好的记录——这当然是非常好的迹象，对吧？但如果你交易很多短期均值回归系统，这种卓越的短期表现对下一笔交易来说尤其糟糕。这是因为交易序列通常呈负相关。这也导致了一个副作用，即扭曲了“关闭”系统权益曲线的能力，因为最终这样做需要一个清晰的趋势信号。为了清理信号，我们必须从系统中剔除相关效应。请注意，在一些类型的系统中，交易回报呈正相关，从而产生了相反的效果。盈利的跟随盈利的，亏损的跟随亏损的。这种类型的系统非常适合使用基于传统权益曲线的系统。
- en: Nonetheless, it gets much more abstract that this–life and markets are never
    what they first seem. In fact, you may look at a terrible and inconsistent strategy
    by conventional metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, or Profit Factor and mistakenly
    conclude that it is worth discarding. To the extent that the trading system has
    a predictable cycle or a high correlation between trade batches, you may be able
    to devise an extremely profitable system just from trading the equity curve of
    this “crappy” system. Even stranger is that you can combine two “crappy” systems
    using various co-efficients to create a very good system without having to trade
    the equity curves. Anything is possible, after all any given stock or instrument
    is just an equity curve itself–all of our attempts to use indicators to trade
    a stock is a means of manipulating or taking a derivation of that equity curve.
    Taking the same derivative approach to systems has the exact same effect. What
    is key to being successful here is that there must be some form of correlation
    that produces a systematic effect–otherwise we will face the same situation as
    with the roulette wheel where we are feverishly executing money management strategies
    in the hopes of taking advantage of random effects.

  zh: 然而，这一切比这还要抽象——生活和市场从来不像它们最初看起来那样。事实上，你可能通过传统的夏普比率或盈利因子等常规指标，错误地认为一个糟糕且不一致的策略是值得抛弃的。只要交易系统有一个可预测的周期或交易批次之间有高度相关性，你可能能够设计出一个仅仅通过交易这个“糟糕”系统的权益曲线就极为盈利的系统。更奇怪的是，你可以使用不同的系数将两个“糟糕”的系统结合起来，创建一个不需要交易权益曲线的非常好的系统。毕竟，任何给定的股票或工具本身就是一条权益曲线——我们尝试使用指标交易股票的所有努力都是操纵或获取该权益曲线的导数。对系统采用相同的导数方法具有完全相同的效果。在这里取得成功关键是必须有一种形式的相关性产生系统效应——否则我们将面临与轮盘赌一样的局面，在那里我们疯狂地执行资金管理策略，希望利用随机效应。
