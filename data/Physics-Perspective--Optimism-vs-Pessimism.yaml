- en: For example, the accident at Three Mile Island was the direct result of operators
    misjudging the meaning of two gauges that were apparently giving contradictory
    readings.  One gauge implied that the level of cooling water was getting too high,
    while the other implied that it was dangerously low.  The operators could not
    envision any scenario in which both could be correct, so they decided (arbitrarily
    and without ANY cross-checking!) that the low reading was invalid, and they shut
    down the emergency cooling water, which was precisely the wrong thing to do.

  zh: 例如，三里岛事故的直接原因是操作员误读了两个显然给出矛盾读数的压力表的意义。一个压力表暗示冷却水水平过高，而另一个则暗示它危险地低。操作员无法想象任何两个都可能是正确的情况，因此他们决定（随意地，没有进行任何交叉验证！）认为低读数是无效的，他们关闭了紧急冷却水，这恰恰是错误的做法。

    the two parts of the system that the two gauges were monitoring, so, indeed, the
    pressure in the cooling water supply was rising, even as the water level in the
    reactor vessel itself was dropping dangerously.  However, as simple as this problem
    really was, it was totally outside the experience of the operators, so they never
    considered the possibility.  Moreover, the system designers had not recognized
    the possibility either, or they would have designed the plumbing differently in
    the first place.

  zh: 在那种情况下，结果证明，系统两部分之间的管道中存在蒸汽锁定，这两个压力表正在监测的管道，所以，确实，冷却水供应的压力在上升，尽管反应堆容器本身的水位在危险地下降。然而，尽管这个问题实际上很简单，但它完全超出了操作员的经验范围，所以他们从未考虑过这种可能性。此外，系统设计人员也没有意识到这种可能性，否则他们一开始就会设计不同的管道。

- en: The way I look at the argument of Sander van der Leeuw is that he has identified
    a weak point in the nature of our relationship with the world. Our brains individually
    and collectively simply cannot match up to the complexity of the world in which
    we live (especially as our own technology has made it much more complex in recent
    decades). It's this mismatch that lies behind the pervasive tendency for our actions
    and innovations to have unanticipated consequences, many of which have led us
    to very big problems. Hence, he's suggesting that IF WE HAVE ANY HOPE of finding
    some solutions to our problems through further innovation it will be by finding
    ways to help our brains cope more effectively. He suggests information technology
    as the one kind of technology that might be useful in this regard, and which might
    help -- again, if used properly -- to heal the divide between the real complexity
    of the world and our pictures and models of it.

  zh: 我看 Sanders van der Leeuw 的论点的方式是，他指出了我们与世界关系本质中的一个弱点。我们的大脑，无论是单独还是集体，都无法与我们所生活的世界的复杂性相匹配（尤其是近年来，我们自己的技术使得这个世界变得更加复杂）。正是这种不匹配导致了我们的行动和创新普遍具有未曾预料到的后果，其中许多导致我们遇到了非常大的问题。因此，他建议，如果我们希望通过进一步的创新找到一些解决问题的方法，那么我们必须找到帮助我们的大脑更有效地应对的方法。他提出信息技术作为一种可能在这方面有用的技术，并且如果使用得当，也可能会帮助弥合真实世界的复杂性与我们对它的描述和模型之间的鸿沟。
- en: I think this makes a lot of sense, and it ought to inform our future use of
    technology and the way we use it to innovate. But I certainly wouldn't want to
    go any further and predict that we will actually be able to act in this way, or
    learn from this insight. If asked to bet on it, I would actually bet that humanity
    will have to suffer dearly and catastrophically before we ever change our ways.

- en: Seriously, the Arctic ice cap has been more or less stable, within a few percent,
    for about three million years, but now, in just thirty years, about 75% of the
    mass of ice has disappeared.  Yet, millions of people simply ignore this massive
    and extremely dangerous change.  Instead, they chalk up the reports as evidence
    of a conspiracy by climate scientists to frighten taxpayers into supporting more
    fictitious make-work for those self-same scientists.  That is a lethal level of
    stupidity, but it still passes easily for "common-sense" among a very large fraction
    of the general population.
