- en: For the moment at least, it appears as if the S&P 500 index has encountered
    strong resistance at 1100 and strong support just above 1040\. Assuming these
    support and resistance levels can hold up for another three weeks – and that is
    admittedly a large assumption – then the current market environment sets up nicely
    for what I like to call “strangle pong” with November SPX options. Essentially,
    this is an approach where one assumes range-bound trading and sells near-the-money
    options when the underlying approaches one end or the other of the trading range.

  zh: 至少在目前，看起来标普500指数在1100遇到了强阻力，在1040以上一点遇到了强支撑。假设这些支撑和阻力水平可以再维持三周——这显然是一个很大的假设——那么当前市场环境非常适合我所说的“strangle
    pong”与11月SPX期权相结合的交易方法。本质上，这是一种假设区间交易的策略，当标的资产接近交易区间的某一端时，卖出接近价钱的期权。
- en: 'The graphic below outlines one way to approach this type of trade. Specifically,
    it involves dividing the trading range into three zones (which do not have to
    be of equal size, they just happen to be in the diagram): an upper end of the
    trading range in which one sells calls; a lower end of the trading range in which
    one sells puts; and a neutral zone near the middle of the range in which one takes
    no action (or perhaps sells both puts and calls.)'

- en: In an ideal world, the underlying bounces back and forth between support and
    resistance just like the [pioneering computer game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
    and the options seller captures a high premium each time the underlying approaches
    the end of the range. Once both puts and calls have been sold, a [strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)
    is established, with the maximum profit and loss zone being defined by the target
    trading range.

- en: The most important determinant of success in a strangle pong trade is the trading
    range of the underlying during the life of the trade. Of secondary importance
    is the volatility of the underlying, where increased volatility will increase
    the price of the options sold and work against the options seller. This is a position’s

    address in future posts.

  zh: 成功的关键因素之一是标的资产在交易期限内的波动范围。其次重要的是标的资产的波动性，其中波动性的增加会提高卖出的期权价格，对期权卖方不利。这是头寸的[vega](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/vega)值，我将在未来的文章中讨论这个问题。
- en: There are a number of ways on which position risk can be managed, not the least
    of which is to “buy the wings” (offsetting long put positions below SPX 1040 and
    offsetting long call positions above 1100) and convert this position into an iron
    [condor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor). According to the
    strangle pong approach, right now, with the SPX trading a little below 1050, would
    be a good time to initiate the first leg of this trade by shorting some SPX 1040
    puts. Let’s see how the market moves in the next week or so; I will revisit this
    strangle pong trading approach at that time.

  zh: 管理头寸风险有多种方法，其中最有效的方法之一是“购买翅膀”（在SPX 1040以下买入看跌期权，在1100以上买入看涨期权，以此抵消头寸）并将此头寸转换为铁[condor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor)。根据strangle
    pong方法，现在SPX交易略低于1050，正是通过卖空一些SPX 1040看跌期权来启动这一交易的第一步的好时机。让我们看看市场在未来一周左右会有何变动；那时我将重新审视strangle
    pong交易方法。
