- en: Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of attending the CBOE Risk Management
    Conference (RMC) in Bonita Springs, Florida. Now that the conference is over and
    the CBOE has [posted](http://www.cboermc.com/agenda/) most of the presentations,
    I thought I would take a little time and offer a retrospective look at some of
    the content that caught my attention.

  zh: 本月初，我有幸参加了在佛罗里达州博尼塔温泉举行的CBOE风险管理会议(RMC)。现在会议已经结束，CBOE已经[发布](http://www.cboermc.com/agenda/)了大部分演讲，我想花点时间回顾一下一些引起我注意的内容。
- en: Before I do that, I am compelled to tip my cap to [Russell Rhoads](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/russell-rhoads/),
    whose indefatigable and prolific efforts were responsible for capturing many of
    the details of the conference. Russell’s posts and those of [Matt Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/)
    made it possible for anyone to have a virtual front-row seat throughout the proceedings.
    Their efforts in conjunction with the RMC are archived at the [CBOE Options Hub](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/)
    with the [CBOERMC tag](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/tag/cboermc/).

    Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/)的文章使得任何人都能够拥有一个虚拟的前排座位来全程参与。他们与RMC一起的努力存档在[CBOE

- en: From my vantage point, I thought it particularly interesting that the two keynote
    speakers, [Martin Zonis](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/gls/speakers/?speaker=zonis)
    and [Carl Tannenbaum](http://www.northerntrust.com/pws/jsp/display2.jsp?TYPE=bio&XML=contact/buscard/1216405007008_743.xml),
    had such divergent views about the potential risks and rewards in the U.S. financial
    markets in the coming years. Zonis placed most of his attention on political risk
    and foreign policy matters and declared that the markets were “underestimating
    volatility in future years.” While Tannenbaum expressed concern about banks in
    Europe as well as credit and real estate in China, he had a much more sanguine
    view of the future of the U.S. economy and financial markets.

  zh: 从我的角度来看，我认为两位主题演讲者[Martin Zonis](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/gls/speakers/?speaker=zonis)和[Carl
    Tannenbaum](http://www.northerntrust.com/pws/jsp/display2.jsp?TYPE=bio&XML=contact/buscard/1216405007008_743.xml)对美国金融市场未来几年潜在风险和收益的观点如此相悖特别有趣。Zonis将大部分注意力放在政治风险和外交政策问题上，并宣布市场“低估了未来几年的波动性”。尽管Tannenbaum对欧洲银行的担忧以及中国的信贷和房地产市场表示关切，但他对未来几年美国经济和金融市场的看法要乐观得多。
- en: Among the other presentations, I was particularly interested to hear Maneesh
    Deshpande provide an overview of the players and strategies used in volatility
    products during the course of the evolution of the VIX product platform. Deshpande
    described the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    as a mature market, with liquidity and supply having shifted from commercial to
    con-commercial traders. He also indicated that demand for VIX puts has stagnated,
    while new entrants are increasing the demand for VIX calls. All of this has influenced
    how the [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    and [mean reverts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion),
    as well as how the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    has evolved.

  zh: 在其他演讲中，我对Maneesh Deshpande概述VIX产品平台演变过程中波动性产品中的玩家和策略特别感兴趣。Deshpande将[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)描述为一个成熟的市场，流动性供应已从商业交易者转移到非商业交易者。他还指出，对VIX看跌期权的市场需求已经停滞，而新进入者正在增加对VIX看涨期权的市场需求。所有这些都影响了[VIX波动](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)和[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)以及VIX期货[期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)的演变。
- en: Another particularly interesting session involved Ed Tom and John-Mark Piampiano,
    who tackled the subject of the volatility of volatility, invoking the likes of
    [VVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VVIX) as well as the third
    and fourth derivatives of SPX implied volatility. At every conference at least
    one session gives you things to mull over long after the speakers are done and
    for me, this was the session that hit the high notes. Ed Tom’s presentation has
    not yet been posted, but he started his talk by decomposing VIX risk premium into
    realized volatility plus skew plus kurtosis and went on from there.

  zh: 另一个非常有趣的会议是由Ed Tom和John-Mark Piampiano主讲的，他们探讨了波动性的波动性主题，引用了[VVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VVIX)以及SPX隐含波动性的第三和第四导数。在每一个会议上，至少有一个会议会让你在演讲者结束后长时间思考，对我来说，这个会议就是那个达到了高潮的会议。Ed
    Tom的演讲尚未发布，但他开始他的演讲时，将VIX风险溢价分解为实际波动性加上偏度加上峰度，并从这里继续讲解。
- en: 'Sheldon Natenberg and Trevor Mottl were tasked with the subject of evaluating
    the volatility surface: skew and term structure. Not surprisingly, they were up
    to the task, with Mottl focusing on the role of money and credit in shaping the
    volatility surface. He indicated that the increasing size of the Fed’s balance
    sheet has depressed volatility across the board over the course of the past few
    years and expects that as the Fed’s balance sheet normalizes, the change in non-financial
    debt will become the most important influence on equity market volatility going
    forward. Mottl attributed the steepness of the VIX futures term structure to the
    uncertainty related to the Fed’s ability to be successful with its quantitative
    easing program. He also traced fluctuations in the skew of volatility to expectations
    related to the Fed’s tapering plans.'

  zh: Sheldon Natenberg和Trevor Mottl负责评估波动率表面：偏度和期限结构。不出所料，他们完成了任务，Mottl专注于货币和信用在塑造波动率表面方面的作用。他指出，过去几年美联储资产负债表的扩大降低了整个市场的波动性，并预计随着美联储资产负债表的正常化，非金融债务的变化将成为未来影响股市波动性的最重要因素。Mottl将VIX期货期限结构的陡峭归因于美联储成功实施量化宽松计划的不确定性。他还追踪了波动率偏度的波动，这与市场对美联储缩减计划的预期有关。

- en: a panel on volatility as an asset class (the consensus that volatility is more
    of a tool and in order to be thought of as an asset class needs to harvestable,
    allocatable and easier to benchmark; a separate thread was critical of the costs
    associated with traditional approaches to tail hedges)
