- en: . The exit strategy is basically a time stop married with a “first profitable
    close” exit. For many traders, a “first profitable close” exit may seem like nothing
    more than a ploy to inflate the winning % of the system and not an appropriate
    exit technique to put into practice.

  zh: 退出策略基本上是一种时间止损与“首次盈利收盘”退出相结合的策略。对许多交易者来说，“首次盈利收盘”的退出可能看起来不过是用来夸大系统胜率的手段，而不是一个恰当的退出技巧。
- en: Sometimes this is true. In other cases though, the 1st Profitable Close exit
    is appropriate and effective. “2 Days In Chop” is one of those cases. Recall the
    premise of the system was based on taking advantage of the extremely choppy market
    conditions that had been identified. It’s those choppy conditions that make the
    1st Profitable Close strategy viable.

  zh: 有时这是正确的。在其他情况下，首次盈利收盘的退出是恰当且有效的。“2天在波动中”就是这样的例子。回想一下，该系统的前提是基于利用已经识别出的极度波动的市场条件。正是这些波动的条件使得首次盈利收盘策略变得可行。
- en: When conditions are especially choppy and the market is constantly swinging
    back and forth, the expectation is for that chop to persist. This would suggest
    a move in the direction of the trade is more likely to be reversed than to follow
    through. So with a system like “2 Days in Chop”, the expectation flips as soon
    as the trade becomes profitable. Since a reversal is more likely than continued
    follow through the correct play is to take the quick profit.

  zh: 当市场特别波动且不断上下波动时，预期这种波动会持续。这表明，交易方向的变化更有可能被反转而不是持续。因此，对于像“2天在波动中”这样的系统，一旦交易开始盈利，预期就会立即反转。由于反转的可能性比持续跟随要大，正确的做法是抓住快速利润。
- en: Obviously an exit strategy like this only works well when trading a reversal
    / mean reverting system in a choppy environment. In a different environment, or
    if trading a breakout system, an exit strategy that looks for quick profits would
    be a disaster.

  zh: 显然，这样的退出策略只有在交易反转/均值回归系统于波动环境中时才会表现良好。在不同的环境里，或者如果交易的是突破系统，寻求快速利润的退出策略将会是灾难。
- en: Other techniques that work well when trading overbought/oversold conditions
    would include using a short term oscillator and waiting for that oscillator to
    revert back to a neutral state, or using a short-term moving average (such as
    a 5-day) and then exiting the trade on a cross of the moving average.

  zh: 在交易超买/超卖条件时表现良好的其他技巧包括使用短期振荡器，并等待振荡器回归到中性状态，或者使用短期移动平均（如5天移动平均），然后在移动平均线穿越时退出交易。
