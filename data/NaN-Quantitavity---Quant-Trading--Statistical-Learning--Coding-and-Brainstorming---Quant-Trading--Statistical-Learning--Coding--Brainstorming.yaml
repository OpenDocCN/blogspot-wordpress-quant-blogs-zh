    have promoted the use of non-tradable real estate investment trusts to individuals

    strategy.  The easiest to implement is buying last years’ winners while simultaneously
    selling last years’ losers.  The reason these strategies work is based on psychology. 
    Most of us feel very comfortable investing after our portfolio has increased in
    value, not after the market has fallen. If we owned shares in a company and the
    price has declined we can hold on, we could sell or we could buy more.  Most individuals
    will hold or sell after a decline.  On the other hand, most investors want to
    buy more of a good thing and a good thing in common stocks, at least in our minds,
    is only if the shares have gone up in price.  These feelings, those of feeling
    good and buying more shares, or feeling bad and selling our shares, last for about
    a year.  Around this time is when fundamentals take over, quickly reversing any
    over or under valuation.  Following trends or using a momentum strategy has been
    shown to work, but has been almost impossible for an individual investor to follow. 
    It seems we hang on to our shares well beyond the time that the process works,
    allowing a full circle to complete in capturing zero return.  Personally, I feel
    very few people can successfully follow a trading strategy for long enough time
    to reap the rewards.  Ultimately fear or greed will enter our minds and take away
    any potential gain.'

    gain— both of which reduce expected returns.  This is what he says about insurance

    rates on all fixed income obligations are so low that the payoff for extending

    an asset (stock, bond or any other type you can think of) at a price less than
    you determine its real value is today.  This broad definition does not work very
    well in any type of academic study.  Since data on common stocks is easy to obtain,

- en: '*“Various behavioral interpretations, however, may offer more compelling explanations
    for the out-performance of value stocks.  Here is the main narrative.  Value investing
    works within markets and in many other contexts because of the overpricing of
    the hope for growth.  If there is high growth in a stock or sector or a country,
    investors tend to extrapolate further subsequent growth, resulting in high valuations. 
    Typically, this expectation is followed by disappointment in the growth rate and
    return”.*'

- en: '**Common sense tells us to “buy low and sell high”.  Why then, is it so difficult
    for each of us to accept that statement and put it to work for our benefits?** 
    Common stocks, especially individual common stocks, do not become low priced without
    a reason.  Knowing the reason, determining if it is real or temporary, and then
    estimating how long it will take to correct the problem, opens the door to many
    opportunities for error.  Most of us can understand the problems facing a company. 
    Most of us can judge whether that problem is temporary or real.  The reason most
