- en: Smallcap action has been poor lately.  Typically you would like to see smallcaps
    offering upside leadership during a rally.  They certainly have not been doing
    that.  Wednesday’s smallcap underperformance was quite outsized and I decided
    to look at other pullback scenarios where the RUT underperformed so badly.  I
    devised the following study.

  zh: 最近小盘股的表现不佳。通常，你希望在小盘股在反弹期间提供上涨动力。他们当然没有做到这一点。周三小盘股的表现不佳异常突出，我决定看看其他回调情景中RUT表现如此糟糕的情况。我设计如下研究。
- en: Instances are very low, which makes it difficult to generate meaningful expectations.
     But somewhat surprisingly results could not be any more bullish.  When I looked
    at the individual instances I noted that four of the six registered 2%+ gains
    over the next 3 days.  Perhaps the smallcap downdraft is exhausting itself and
    the market can manage to rally as it has in the past.

  zh: 实例数量非常低，这使得生成有意义的预期变得困难。但有些令人惊讶的是，结果不可能再更加乐观。当我查看个别实例时，我注意到六中有四个在接下来的三天内实现了2%以上的涨幅。或许小盘股的下跌趋势正在耗尽自己，市场能够像过去那样设法反弹。
