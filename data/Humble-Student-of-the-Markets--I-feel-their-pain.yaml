  zh: ，明显看出关注现金流、收益和估值（即价值）的投资风格，这种风格倾向于偏好高质量股票，不受欢迎，而动量投资和投机风格占主导地位[我的强调]
- en: Through mid-September of 2010, the stock market was essentially a roller-coaster
    with no net gains for the year, but the final months saw ***a speculative burst
    that was heavily skewed toward cyclicals, small-caps, commodities, and shares
    characterized by low stability of earnings and high sensitivity to market risk***.
    The Strategic Growth Fund finished the year with a slight loss of 3.62%. The loss
    resulted from our defense against an overvalued, overbought, overbullish, rising-yields
    condition coupled with a runup in risk assets that was still uncorrected as the
    year came to a close. While the decline was minor from a long-term perspective,
    it felt excruciating in the final weeks of 2010, as stocks characterized by low-quality,
    low yield and high risk persistently outperformed those ranked higher in quality,
    yield and stability.

  zh: 截至2010年9月中旬，股市基本上像过山车一样，全年没有净收益，但最后几个月出现了***偏向于周期性、小盘股、大宗商品以及收益稳定性低、对市场风险敏感的股票的投机性爆发***。战略增长基金当年以3.62%的轻微亏损结束。这个亏损是由于我们对高估值、过度买入、过度乐观、上升收益率状况的防御，以及到年底仍未得到纠正的风险资产的飙升。尽管从长期角度看，跌幅不大，但在2010年最后几周，低质量、低收益和高风险的股票持续表现优于那些在质量、收益和稳定性上排名较高的股票，这让人感到非常痛苦。

- en: Our investment objective remains to outperform our benchmarks over complete
    market cycles (peak-to-peak, trough-to-trough, bull market plus bear market),
    with smaller periodic losses than a buy-and-hold strategy. In the Strategic Growth
    Fund, we've achieved that since inception, and over the complete market cycles
    we've observed since then - from the 2000 peak to the 2007 peak, from the 2002
    trough to the 2009 trough, and from the 2007 peak to the recent highs. The challenge
    will be the cycle from the 2009 low to the next bear market low, whenever it arrives,
    but we'll rise to that challenge day to day.

  zh: 我们的投资目标仍然是全程市场周期（顶峰到顶峰、谷底到谷底、牛市加熊市）中超越我们的基准，并且比买入持有策略的周期性损失小。在战略增长基金中，自成立以来我们就实现了这一目标，并且在自那时以来我们所观察到的完整市场周期中——从2000年的顶峰到2007年的顶峰，从2002年的谷底到2009年的谷底，以及从2007年的顶峰到最近的高点——我们也实现了这一目标。挑战将是从2009年的低点到下一个熊市低点的周期，无论它何时到来，但我们会每天迎接这个挑战。

    Climates we define, and will allow us to accept moderate (possibly transitory)
    exposures to market fluctuations more frequently. The main focus of this research

    multiple time frames. We've extensively tested this approach to uncertainty, and

- en: The basic approach falls into the class of what are called "ensemble methods."
    Our investment positions continue to be driven by our most reliable measures of
    valuation, market action, sentiment, yield pressures and other variables, but
    rather than applying a single model over the full span of history, we can proliferate
    multiple models and evaluate them over numerous samples of history. In that way,
    we can measure not only risk (the spread between individual returns and the average
    outcome), but also uncertainty (the possibility that any particular model or view
    about the world is incorrect). Suppose we look at present market conditions. The
    more uniform the conclusions are about expected returns, regardless of how we
    slice the data, the more confidence we can have about investment exposure. In
    contrast, the wider the dispersion of conclusions about expected returns, the
    greater uncertainty there is, and the smaller the proportional exposure. In an
    environment where we remain skeptical that the underlying economic difficulties
    have vanished, I believe that this is our best response.

  zh: 基本方法属于所谓的“集成方法”类别。我们的投资立场继续由我们最可靠的估值、市场行为、情绪、收益率压力和其他变量的测量来驱动，但不是在整个历史范围内应用单一模型，而是可以推广多个模型，并在历史的大量样本上对它们进行评估。这样，我们不仅可以衡量风险（个体回报与平均结果之间的差异），还可以衡量不确定性（任何特定模型或关于世界的看法都可能是错误的）。假设我们看看当前的市场条件。如果无论我们如何切分数据，对预期回报的结论越一致，我们就可以对投资风险有更大的信心。相反，预期回报的结论越分歧，不确定性就越大，比例上的风险暴露就越小。在一个我们对潜在的经济困难仍然持怀疑态度的环境中，我相信这是我们的最佳应对方式。
