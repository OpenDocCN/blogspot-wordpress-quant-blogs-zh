    to manage strategies and systems. Please comment to indicate your interest. If
    the interest level is high enough, I will make this a regular addition along with
    the Livermore on a weekly basis for the time being.

    indicators. They will be quite simple: red means stop, orange means you should
    take a small position, yellow means reduce exposure, green means you can take
    a full allocation. Furthermore we will also provide a list of the top performing
    indicators by category, as well as a category relative strength measure looking
    at both trend and mean reversion indicators.'

  zh: 每个星期五，我们将在博客上提供几个主要指标的资产曲线灯光。它们会非常简单：红色表示停止，橙色表示您应该持有少量头寸，黄色表示减少敞口，绿色表示您可以持有完整配额。此外，我们还将提供一份按类别排名的最佳表现指标列表，以及一个考虑趋势和均值回归指标的类别相对强度测量。

  zh: '**为什么这很重要？**'
- en: 'The rationale is simple: the best we can do is determine what has worked best
    in the recent past, and also in the intermediate term, and then apply a safety
    mechanism or “stoplight” to manage the strategy exposure.  There is no magical
    metric that can tell you whether a system will continue to work in the future
    no matter how careful your measurements are. Performance evaluation is most certainly
    not an exact science–if it was then it would be a lot easier to predict which
    mutual funds or hedge funds perform best in the future using past performance
    (hint: most methods fail to achieve their goal out of sample) . What you need
    is something that that also indicates whether your initial hypothesis was correct
    in assessing performance and a means to adjust your position otherwise.  Drawing
    concrete conclusions and persisting with these beliefs is a perilous path that
    many professors/practioners have taken. These same individuals  preach about effects
    that were validated using extensive testing, and then they go out and start a
    mutual/hedge fund and everything miraculously stops working. They stubbornly protest
    and defend their studies when they should be focused on trying to determine whether
    they should stop using the strategy and proceed to trading another.  You should
    not care what variables or what  indicators happen to be the best, I would trade
    anything that is logical and and is working well, and I would stop using my favorite
    strategy if I felt that it was no longer relevant —***the real goal is to maximize
    risk-adjusted return and achieving that goal is a matter of  structured portfolio
    management and dynamic asset allocation .***'

  zh: 理由很简单：我们能做的最好的事情是确定最近过去和中期内最好的是什么，然后应用一个安全机制或“红绿灯”来管理策略敞口。无论您的测量有多谨慎，都没有什么神奇的度量标准能告诉您一个系统是否会在未来继续运行。绩效评估绝对不是一门确切的科学——如果是，那么通过过去的绩效来预测哪些共同基金或对冲基金将来表现最佳就会容易得多（提示：大多数方法在样本外都无法实现其目标）。您需要的是一些东西，也能指示您最初的假设在评估绩效方面是否正确，并且可以调整您的立场。得出具体结论并坚持这些信念是许多教授/从业者走过的危险道路。这些同样的个人会宣扬经过广泛测试验证的效应，然后他们开始运作一个共同基金/对冲基金，一切都神奇地停止了。他们顽固地抗议并为他们的研究辩护，当他们应该专注于确定他们是否应该停止使用该策略并转而交易另一种策略时。您不应关心哪些变量或指标恰好是最佳的，我会交易任何逻辑和运作良好的东西，如果我觉得它不再相关，我会停止使用我的最爱策略——***真正的目标是最大限度地提高风险调整后的回报，实现这一目标是一个有组织的投资组合管理和动态资产配置的问题。***

- en: Its about time we open our minds a little more and learn to change with the
    tide. Human beings are victims of the inherent need to have strong and persistent
    belief systems.  In an ideal world most of us would slip into reliable routines
    and rituals that ensure progress. No one wants to consider the prospect of having
    to move jobs and/or houses every year any more than we want to change our methods
    for trading. Our secret burning desire for regularity and unquenchable thirst
    for too much information in the face of uncertainty makes the trading game difficult
    to succeed as a pro. Step 1 is that we all have to limit our enthusiasm and comfort
    with the 60-year+ backtests–what worked decades ago has virtually no relevance
    for short-term strategies, especially since commissions were in excess of 1% per
    trade each way back then. Nothing you could find would even be tradeable net of
    commissions–there is no free lunch– the structure of market created an illusion
    of profitable anomalies or effects.  These long data histories are valuable primarily
    to display the ability to learn from data on a walk-forward test and thats pretty
    much it. Step 2 pertains to avoiding futile attempts at unconstrained mass parameter
    optimization without considering degrees of freedom or the false discovery rate.
    Even worse is the tendency to assume that such ridiculously over-fitted strategies
    will work for years to come after 5 minutes of optimization (I guess even worse
    than that is trading these “systems”).  Step 3 pertains to becoming  too exuberant
    about trying to make a strategy “robust” –we have to limit painful and meaningless
    exercises in trying to establish robustness by verifying that  a short-term S&P500
    strategy that must also work on the Euro or the Solar Industry ETF to be considered
    valid. Guess what, markets are different–***even the same index traded using different
    instruments or time zones can behave very differently*** (great post here) [http://davesbrain.blogs.com/mindmoneymarkets/2010/05/mean-reversion-etfs-timeframes.html](http://davesbrain.blogs.com/mindmoneymarkets/2010/05/mean-reversion-etfs-timeframes.html).
      The only way to survive is to adapt to a particular market, and adapt to the
    times, and trade the best effects/anomalies you can and be willing to hop off
    the train when things stop working —anything less is asking for trouble.

  zh: 是时候让我们的思维开放一些，学会随波逐流了。人类是固有需要拥有坚定而持久信念系统的受害者。在理想的世界里，我们大多数人都会陷入可靠的日常和仪式中，以确保进步。没有人愿意考虑每年都必须换工作和/或搬家的前景，就像我们不想改变交易方法一样。在面对不确定性时，我们对规律的秘密渴望和对过多信息的不可抑制的渴望使得交易游戏难以作为职业成功。第一步是，我们都必须限制对60年以上回溯测试的热情和舒适——几十年前有效的方法在短期策略中几乎没有任何相关性，特别是当时的佣金每笔交易都超过1%。无论你找到什么，都不可能在减去佣金后能够进行交易——市场结构造成了盈利异常或效应的幻觉。这些长期数据历史主要是为了展示从数据中进行前向测试的能力，仅此而已。第二步是避免在不考虑自由度或错误发现率的情况下进行无约束的大规模参数优化尝试。更糟糕的是，倾向于假设这种过度拟合的策略在经过5分钟的优化后将在未来几年内起作用（我想甚至更糟糕的是交易这些“系统”）。第三步是不要过于热衷于试图使策略“健壮”——我们必须限制在尝试建立健壮性时进行痛苦而毫无意义的练习，通过验证一个短期的S&P500策略，必须在欧元或太阳能行业ETF上也有效才能被认为是有效的。猜猜，市场是不同的——***即使是使用不同工具或时区交易的相同指数的行为也可能非常不同***（这里有一篇很棒的文章）[http://davesbrain.blogs.com/mindmoneymarkets/2010/05/mean-reversion-etfs-timeframes.html](http://davesbrain.blogs.com/mindmoneymarkets/2010/05/mean-reversion-etfs-timeframes.html)。唯一的生存之道是适应特定的市场，适应时代，并交易最佳效果/异常，愿意在事情停止运作时离开——任何行为低于此都是在自找麻烦。
