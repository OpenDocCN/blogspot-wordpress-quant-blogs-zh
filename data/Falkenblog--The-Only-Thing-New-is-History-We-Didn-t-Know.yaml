    the Great Depression, and also that fools and skallywags brought this upon us.
    So it''s fun to read this from the Commercial and Financial Cronicle in 1874,
    right after the Panic of 1873 when default rates jumped to 14%:'

    正好是在1873年恐慌之后, 当时违约率飙升至14%:'
- en: “It was a fearful storm while it lasted, and although every one of course can
    say now that he knew it was coming, yet the real truth is, its breaking was terribly
    sudden and unexpected. . . . There are few people who allow themselves to remember
    long the lessons experience would teach them. If this were not so, there would
    be many less failures in the world. . . . almost all felt they were carrying too
    much debt; they would henceforth be out of it. There are now, however, very evident
    signs that these resolutions have been mostly forgotten. Overtrading, as it is
    called, is an evil that has ever existed, and pretty much the same epitaph can
    be written above each business prostration—here lies the result of an attempt
    to do too much with too little capital. Must history necessarily repeat itself?”

    世界上就会减少许多失败……几乎所有人都感到自己背负太多债务；从现在开始, 他们将摆脱这一切。然而, 现在很明显, 这些决议大多已经被遗忘。所谓的过度交易一直是一个存在的恶,
    几乎每一次商业失败都可以写下同样的墓志铭——这里躺着试图用太少的资本做太多的尝试的结果。历史必然会重演吗？”
