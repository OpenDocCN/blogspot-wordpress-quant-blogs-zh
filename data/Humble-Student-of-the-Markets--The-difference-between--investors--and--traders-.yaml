  zh: 最近股市的下跌让人感到意外，但是平均分散投资者并没有受到很大的伤害。这是因为债券市场表现得非常好，成为了很好的分散风险的工具，不像2008年那样市场的恐慌传染到了信贷市场。
- en: To illustrate my point, imagine someone with a portfolio with a passive 60%
    stocks and 40% bond allocation. He invests the stock portion into SPY and the
    bond portion into AGG. The simulation assumes that all income is re-invested back
    into the ETF of the respective asset classes (SPY dividends to SPY and AGG income
    into AGG). Once a year on December 31, he re-balances the portfolio back to the
    target 60-40 weight.

  zh: 为了说明我的观点，想象一个投资组合， passively 拥有60％的股票和40％的债券分配。他将股票部分投资于SPY，债券部分投资于AGG。该模拟假设所有收入都重新投资到相应资产类别的ETF（SPY股息到SPY，AGG收入到AGG）。每年一次，在12月31日，他将投资组合重新平衡至目标的60-40权重。
- en: Here is a chart showing how far his equity weight is off his 60% target since
    September 2003, when the data series for AGG began. As of Tuesday, August 25,
    2015, the worst day of the stock market drawdown so far, the portfolio was underweight
    its stock benchmark by only 2.2%, which means that the bond market rallied enough
    to make up most of the losses suffered by equities. Contrast that with past experiences
    in 2008 when the equity weight cratered, or even the correction of 2011 when bond
    diversification had a less adequate effect.

  zh: 这是一张图表，显示了自2003年9月AGG的数据系列开始以来，他的权益权重离60%的目标有多远。截至2015年8月25日星期二，到目前为止股市暴跌的最糟糕的一天，该投资组合只比其股票基准低了2.2％，这意味着债券市场上涨足以弥补股票所遭受的大部分损失。与2008年股权重坍塌的过去经历形成对比，甚至与2011年的修正情况形成对比，当时债券分散化的效果不够充分。
