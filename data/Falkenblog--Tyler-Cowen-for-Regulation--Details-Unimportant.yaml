- en: 'Banking is a very tricky business because modern finance has specialized to
    the degree that it is no longer as simple as when the bank held the savings of
    the community, and lent it to businessmen. A financial institution is a small
    piece of a long list of specialists from saver to investor and back again, involved
    in one or more of the following: origination, underwriting, repackaging, custodian,
    and warehousing of both sides of the transaction. Its basically like the molecular
    biology of a cell: there are many important, complicated processes going on, and
    details matter a great deal.'

  zh: 银行业是一个非常棘手的行业，因为现代金融已经专业化到不再像银行只持有社区的储蓄，然后借给商人那样简单了。一个金融机构只不过是从储户到投资者再到储户的一长串专业人士中的一个小组件，涉及以下一个或多个环节：发起、承销、重新封装、保管人和交易双方的仓储。它基本上就像一个细胞的分子生物学：有很多重要的、复杂的过程，细节的重要性非常大。
- en: Further, because financial contracts have virtually zero marginal costs, sometimes
    an inflated 'face value' arises because it is easier to keep adding offsetting
    ones, rather than extinguishing some and starting over, the way a futures open
    interest works. The reason why derivatives are not transparent is that they come
    in some many different flavors they escape any reasonably finite taxonomy--they
    are 'over the counter' and thus have idiosyncratic terms.

- en: on the current banking crisis, by saying we should apply capital requirements
    to derivatives, such a proposal leaves innumerable questions that will make regulation
    almost surely miss its mark. But first, Cowen seems to think regulation is a reasonable
    quid pro quo for guaranteeing these guys. But the bail out of Bear Sterns was
    not an obligation of the Fed. Unlike the S&Ls this is like bailing out Long Term
    Capital management. They were afraid of the contagion effects. If the Fed decides
    to impose regulations on derivatives for everyone, not just those institutions
    currently regulated by the Fed, what a huge power grab by an already overextended
    institution. Remember when Thatcher remarked to Gorbachev that it was nice that
    she didn't have to decide how much, and at what price, steel was going to be.
    Competitive markets decentralize what are really very difficult questions that

  zh: 在目前的银行危机中，通过提出对衍生品应用资本要求，这样的提议留下了无数问题，这将使监管几乎肯定地达不到其目标。但首先，考文似乎认为监管是对保证这些家伙的合理交换条件。但贝尔斯登的救助不是联邦储备的义务。与储蓄与贷款机构（S&Ls）不同，这就像是救助长期资本管理公司。他们害怕传染效应。如果联邦储备决定对衍生品实施监管，不仅是对目前由联邦储备监管的机构，而是对每个人，那就是已经扩张过度的机构的一个巨大权力夺取。还记得撒切尔对戈尔巴乔夫说，她不需要决定钢铁的数量和价格是多好吗。竞争市场分散了一些确实非常困难的问题，没有人应该回答（嗯，也许他们应该多读读

- en: How much capital for derivatives? Good question. Should it be weighted by risk?
    If so, how does one measure risk? Considering that risk is a function of the collateral,
    which comes in many different flavors (traded debt, pools of mortgages, pools
    of bank lines), and then are structured very differently, with differing levels
    of subordination, differing rules for the waterfalls of cashflows depending on
    various metrics of collateral quality. It's a mess. If you think market participants
    are confused, make it a political issue, so not only do you have to explain this
    to dunderheads like Hillary, Nancy, and Dennis, but then you have to expect them
    to add something like the Community Reinvestment Act, so disabled lesbians of
    color can start lobbying for more equity (i.e., loans given out the way Huey Long
    gave out construction contracts).

  zh: 衍生品应该有多少资本？好问题。应该按风险加权吗？如果是这样，又如何衡量风险？考虑到风险是抵押品的函数，而抵押品有许多不同的品种（交易债务、抵押贷款池、银行授信池），然后它们又按照极不同的方式构造，具有不同层次的次优性以及根据不同的抵押品质量指标而定的现金流和流水表的不同规则。这一切都是一团乱麻。如果你认为市场参与者困惑了，把它搞成了政治问题，这样你不仅需要向希拉里、南希和丹尼斯这样的笨蛋解释这些，还要期望他们增添一些类似《社区再投资法》的法律，以便色情片中残疾的女同性恋者能够通过游说获得更多的公平待遇（即，以胡伊·朗那样分配施工合同的贷款）。
- en: You may think this is no different than regular lending, but you would be wrong.
    For example, lets say you have two swaps, but they both offset each other almost
    exactly for interest rate risk, but as they have different counterparties, they
    have differing credit risk. How about swaps from the same counterparty, but differing
    interest rate exposures, partially netted. How much should capital be netted?
    And if the US banks have capital requirements greater than economically necessary,
    how many seconds before all swaps would move offshore?

- en: If something is too complicated for the market, it goes double for government.
    And as finance is really about contracts, ideas, it doesn't have to put up with
    heavy handed regulation, especially when New York is not the origin of the capital
    (we aren't capital suppliers). London, Hong Kong, or Tokyo would be glad to pick
    up the slack. As it stands now, mortgage regulation has led to loan documents
    where you have to 'sign here' about 15 times, and you still have to pay several
    ridiculous processing fees that look like your phone bill and add about $500 too
    much to these things, and in the end, no one reads all those 15 things they initial
    and sign (which are helpfully put in 8-point font because we at least want to
    save trees, and no one even pretends to read them). A couple more pages to initial
    and ignore, perhaps? They can't even get rid of mandatory title insurance which
    is way overpriced, and other antiquated parts of the process.

  zh: 如果某些东西对市场来说太复杂了，那对政府来说就更是如此了。而且由于金融实际上是围绕着合同、观念等展开的，所以它根本不需要忍受笨拙的监管，尤其是当纽约并非资本的起源地时（我们不是资本供应者）。伦敦、香港或东京将乐意接手这一缺口。就目前而言，按揭监管导致了贷款文件的出现，你必须在上面"签字"大约
    15 次，而且你仍然不得不支付几项看起来像电话费的荒谬的处理费用，这些费用多出了大约 500 美元，而最终，没有人会阅读所有那些他们签名和签名的 15 个条款（这些条款以
    8 号字体呈现，因为至少我们想要节省树木，而没有人甚至假装阅读它们）。多添几页来签字并忽略，也许呢？他们甚至不能消除颇为过高价格的强制性产权保险，以及其他陈旧的手续约定。
