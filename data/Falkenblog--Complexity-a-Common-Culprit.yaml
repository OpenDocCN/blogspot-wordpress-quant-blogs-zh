- en: 'Borders'' Mr. D''Agostini said there are five titles that appear to most interest
    consumers. These include: Charles Morris''s "The Trillion Dollar Meltdown," which
    Mr. D''Agostini says predicted market turmoil caused by subprime mortgages and
    Wall Street greed; David Smick''s "The World is Curved," which cited the mortgage
    crisis as a early indicator of further problems ahead; George Soros''s "The New
    Paradigm for Financial Markets," which looks at past crises and their significance
    for future events; Kevin Phillips''s "Bad Money," which examines the state of
    the dollar, credit issues, and the world market, and Peter Schiff''s "Crash Proof,"
    which warned of a coming crisis and suggested how consumers could protect themselves.'

  zh: Borders的D'Agostini先生表示，有五本书似乎最能吸引消费者。其中包括：查尔斯·莫里斯的《万亿美元的崩溃》，D'Agostini先生认为这本书预言了次贷和华尔街贪婪引发的市场动荡；大卫·斯米克的《世界是弯曲的》，指出抵押危机是进一步问题的早期指标；乔治·索罗斯的《金融市场的新范式》，审视过去的危机及其对未来事件的意义；凯文·菲利普斯的《糟糕的钱》，探讨了美元的状况、信贷问题和世界市场，以及彼得·希夫的《防崩盘》，警告即将到来的危机，并建议消费者如何保护自己。

- en: They all contain an obligatory mention of greed/hubris by those who got rich
    (funny from Soros), but also the focus on finance, as opposed to real causes (eg,
    productivity growth). There is a great distrust in the complexity in finance,
    in that the connection of a mortgage, to a derivative, is often not very transparent.
    But is anything these days? Computers, cars, my thermostat, all have evolved greater
    and greater complexity, so that 'fixing them' is now beyond the average user's
    ability. In the 'good old days', things were simpler, perforce, because they were
    just starting. Complexity happens to all fields, and it would be nice if everyone
    could fix their cars like the old '57 Chevy, or fix their computer by going in
    and adjusting the autoexec.bat file, but the greater functionality of these products
    requires greater complexity to their parts, and so only full-time professionals
    can fix things that your average proficient user could fix decades ago.

  zh: '它们都包含了对那些致富的人的贪婪/傲慢的强制性提及（从索罗斯出来很有趣），但也聚焦于金融，而不是真正的原因（例如，生产力增长）。人们对金融复杂性有很大的不信任，因为抵押贷款与衍生品之间的联系通常并不是很透明。但是现在还有什么东西是透明的呢？计算机、汽车、我的恒温器，它们都在不断地进化变得更加复杂，以至于现在已经超出了普通用户的能力范围。在“过去的好日子”里，事情是简单的，因为它们只是开始。复杂性发生在所有领域，如果每个人都能像旧的57雪佛兰那样修理他们的车，或者通过调整autoexec.bat文件来修理他们的计算机，那就太好了，但这些产品的更大功能性需要更复杂的零件，所以只有全职专业人员才能修理几十年前普通的熟练用户能修理的东西。 '
- en: It is common to long for the old times when fields were completely understood,
    but forcing a field back to be transparent to the masses is not a solution, it
    is a stifling of productivity. Wouldn't it be great if we went back to a mathematics
    prior to non-Euclidean geometry, and calculus? Well, if your objective is to restrain
    all fields so that they be understood by your average man, I guess that would
    work. But when any field, industry, or product evolves it generally adds functionality,
    adding layers, and layers add complexity.

  zh: 人们常常怀念过去，当时各个领域都被完全理解，但是强迫一个领域对大众透明化并不是一个解决方案，而是对生产力的压制。如果我们回到了非欧几里得几何和微积分之前的数学时代，那岂不是太好了？嗯，如果你的目标是限制所有领域，使其为普通人所理解，我想那可能会奏效。但是当任何领域、行业或产品发展时，通常都会增加功能，添加层次，而层次会增加复杂性。
- en: The problem in mortgages was not derivatives, or complexity. Lowering underwriting
    standards (no downpayment, lower credit score) is pretty straightforward, and
    affected bank-owned mortgages just as much as credit default swaps. That academics,
    community activists, Clinton, Bush, Congress, regulators, Wall Street, and investors,
    did not foresee the problems in lowering credit standards for new home buyers,
    was hardly caused by derivatives up the food chain. These mortgages were going
    to blow up eventually because a vast array of special interests under the banner
    of 'increasing home ownership' was going to put more and more people into houses
    until they proved they could not afford it, by which time the seeds were sown.
    Complexity of the derivatives that referred to these instruments were second order
    in this story.

  zh: 在抵押贷款中的问题并不是衍生品，或者复杂性。降低贷款标准（无需首付，降低信用评分）非常简单，并且影响到银行拥有的抵押贷款以及信用违约掉期。学者、社区活动人士、克林顿、布什、国会、监管机构、华尔街和投资者，并没有预见到降低新购房者信贷标准的问题，这几乎不是衍生品导致的。这些抵押贷款最终会爆炸，因为各种特殊利益集团在“增加家庭所有权”的旗帜下，将越来越多的人置于房屋中，直到他们证明自己无法负担得起，而这时候已经埋下了种子。这个故事中，涉及这些工具的衍生品的复杂性是次要的。
