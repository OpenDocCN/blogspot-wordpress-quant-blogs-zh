    -- risks I think are systematically underestimated by standard economic theories.
    But finance does of course bring many benefits, mostly when used in its proper
    role as a means to insure against risks. I just happened on this

- en: (now nearly a year old, not breaking news) by two legal scholars from the University
    of Chicago who propose the idea of an FDA for finance -- a body that would be
    charged with approving new financial products before they would enter the market.
    It's a sensible proposal, especially given the potential risks associated with
    financial products, which are certainly comparable to the risks of new pharmaceutical
    products.

  zh: （现在几乎有一年历史，不是爆炸性新闻）来自芝加哥大学的两位法学学者提出了金融领域FDA的想法——一个负责在金融产品进入市场前审批新金融产品的机构。这是一个合理的建议，尤其是在考虑到与金融产品相关的潜在风险，这些风险确实与新药品产品的风险相当。
- en: 'But beyond this specific idea, the paper gives a great discussion of the two
    fundamentally opposing uses of derivatives and other new financial products --
    in acting as insurance, to spread risks in a socially beneficial way, or to act
    as mechanism for gambling, to increase the risks faced by certain parties in a
    way that does not bring social benefits. The following two paragraphs give the
    flavor of the argument (which the full paper explores in great detail):'

  zh: 但超出这个具体想法，该论文对衍生品及其他新型金融产品两种根本对立的用途进行了深刻的讨论——作为保险，以一种对社会有益的方式来分散风险，或者作为赌博机制，以对社会无益的方式来增加某些方面的风险。接下来的两段给出了这种论点的风味（全文对此进行了详尽的探讨）：
- en: 'Financial products are socially beneficial when they help people insure risks,
    but when these same products are used for gambling they can instead be socially
    detrimental. The difference between insurance and gambling is that insurance enables
    people to reduce the risk they face, whereas gambling increases it. A person who
    purchases financial products in order to insure themselves essentially pays someone
    else to take a risk on her behalf. The counterparty is better able to absorb the
    risk, typically because she has a more diversified investment portfolio or owns
    assets whose value is inversely correlated with the risk taken on. By contrast,
    when a person gambles, that person exposes herself to increased net risk without
    offsetting a risk faced by a counterparty: she merely gambles in hopes of gaining
    at the expense of her counterparty or her counterparty’s regulator. As we discuss
    below, gambling may have some ancillary benefits in improving the information
    in market prices. However, it is overwhelmingly a negative-sum activity, which,
    in the aggregate, harms the people who engage in it, and which can also produce
    negative third-party effects by increasing systemic risk in the economy.'

  zh: 当金融产品帮助人们保险风险时，它们对社会是有益的，但当这些产品被用于赌博时，它们反而可能对社会有害。保险与赌博的区别在于，保险能够让人们减少面临的风险，而赌博则增加它。购买金融产品以保险自己的人实际上是支付给别人承担风险。交易对手更有能力吸收风险，通常是因为她拥有更分散的投资组合，或者拥有与承担的风险成反比的价值的资产。相比之下，当一个人赌博时，她将自己暴露在净风险增加中，并没有抵消交易对手面临的风险：她只是赌博，希望以牺牲交易对手或交易对手的监管机构为代价获利。正如我们下面所讨论的，赌博可能会在提高市场价格信息方面有一些辅助性好处。然而，它主要是负和活动，总体上损害参与其中的人，也可能通过增加经济中的系统风险产生负面的第三方效应。

    modern discussions of financial regulation. Before the 2008 financial crisis,
    the academic and political consensus was that financial markets should be deregulated.
    This consensus probably rested on pragmatic rather than theoretical considerations:
    the U.S. economy had grown enormously from 1980 to 2007, and this growth had taken
    place at the same time as, and seemed to be connected with, the booming financial
    sector, which was characterized by highly innovative financial practices. With
    the 2008 financial crisis, this consensus came to an end, and since then there
    has been a significant retrenchment, epitomized by the passage of the Dodd-Frank
    Act, which authorizes regulatory agencies to impose significant new regulations
    on the financial industry.'

  zh: 这个基本观点早已被认识到，但对现代金融监管讨论的影响很小。在2008年金融危机之前，学术界和政治界的共识是金融市场应该去监管。这种共识可能建立在实用主义而不是理论考虑之上：从1980年到2007年，美国经济巨大增长，与此同时，金融部门也在蓬勃发展，其特点是高度创新的金融实践。随着2008年金融危机的发生，这种共识走到了尽头，自那时以来，已经出现了显著的后退，体现在多德-弗兰克法案的通过，该法案授权监管机构对金融行业施加重要的新规定。
- en: Of course, putting such a thing into practice would be difficult. But it's also
    difficult to clean up the various messes that occur when financial products lead
    to unintended consequences. Difficult isn't an argument against doing something
    worthwhile. The paper I mentioned makes considerable effort to explore how the
    insurance benefits and the gambling costs associated with a new instrument might
    be estimated. And maybe a direct analogy to the FDA isn't the right thing at all.
    Can a panel of experts estimate the costs/benefits accurately? Maybe not. But
    there might be sensible ways to bring certain new products under scrutiny once
    they have been put into wide use. And products needn't be banned either -- merely
    regulated and their use reviewed to avoid the rapid growth of large systemic risks.
    Of course, steps were taken in the late 1990s (by Elizabeth Warren, most notably)
    to regulate derivatives markets much more closely. Those steps were quashed by
    the finance industry through the action of Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan and others.
    Had there been something like an independent FDA-like body for finance, things
    might have turned out less disastrously.

  zh: 当然，实施这样的事情会很难。但是，当金融产品导致意外后果时，清理各种混乱也很难。难度不是反对做有意义的事情的论据。我提到的那篇论文付出了很大努力来探讨如何估计与新工具相关联的保险福利和赌博成本。或许直接将食品药品监督管理局（FDA）作为类比根本就不合适。专家小组能准确估计成本/效益吗？也许不能。但也许有合理的方法可以让某些新产品在广泛使用后受到审查。而且，产品不必被禁止——只需受到监管，并对其使用进行审查，以避免大型系统性风险的快速增长。当然，在20世纪90年代末已经采取了措施（尤其是伊丽莎白·沃伦）对衍生品市场进行更严格的监管。这些措施被金融行业通过拉里·萨默斯、艾伦·格林斯潘等人的行动压垮了。如果当时有一个像独立的食品药品监督管理局这样的金融机构，事情可能就不会那么灾难性了。

    that it goes against the tried and true Common Law notion that "anything not specifically
    banned is allowed." But that's just the point. We specifically don't allow Bayer
    or GlaxoSmithKline create and market new drugs without having extensive tests
    to give some confidence in their safety. Not only that, once approved those drugs

  zh: 在这一想法发布时（一年多以前）反对这一观点，其论点是这违背了经过验证的普通法观念，即“除非明确禁止，否则都被允许”。但这就是问题的关键。我们明确不允许拜耳或葛兰素史克在没有进行广泛测试的情况下创建和推广新药，以对其安全性给予某些信心。不仅如此，一旦这些药品被批准，它们只能以包含其风险广泛警告的包装出售。金融为什么应该不同？
