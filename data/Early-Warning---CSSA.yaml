    I have a hunch that we are on the cusp of witnessing a credit event that will
    shake markets. Witness the run up in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other junk
    financials described by Bill Luby [http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/junkdex-tracks-speculative-frenzy-in.html](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/junkdex-tracks-speculative-frenzy-in.html) that
    was described as suspicious by Brett Steenbarger in this post [http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/08/more-on-massive-trading-volumes-in.html](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/08/more-on-massive-trading-volumes-in.html).
    To me as a proponent of game theory I believe that these moves were created by
    Goldman Sachs via the US government to accomplish a possible variety of objectives:
    1) to cash out foreign investors in those names at a better price under the radar
    2) to restore public faith in the viability of those companies because of the
    massive taxpayer liability 3) to give the illusion that credit risk is no longer
    an issue 4) and most definitely possible– the government/Fed/Goldman are aware
    of a new developing credit event and they want to drive these prices on these
    junk financials as high as possible prior to the collapse to raise the floor on
    their prices. Personally I think all four are possible, and I think those that
    believe that a major credit event is no longer possible are horribly naiive and
    do not truly understand the nature of the situation that the credit markets are
    actually in. Banks have slowly increased their leverage and risk appetite over
    the last few months, and with their shadow assets (Level 3) now hidden from GAAP
    financial statements, no one knows what evil lurks in the background. In my opinion,
    banks should be deleveraging not re-leveraging because they were far too leveraged
    in the first place to weather any problems. Moves of the magnitude displayed in
    the junk financials reek of a desperation to cover something up. The VIX and the
    Yen recently made 20 day highs indicating that something bad could be amiss. I
    smell smoke, and when you smell smoke,  there could  be a fire.'

    Luby所描述的[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/junkdex-tracks-speculative-frenzy-in.html](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/junkdex-tracks-speculative-frenzy-in.html)，这被Brett
    Steenbarger在这篇文章[http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/08/more-on-massive-trading-volumes-in.html](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/08/more-on-massive-trading-volumes-in.html)中描述为可疑。作为博弈论的拥护者，我认为这些行动是由高盛通过美国政府来实现可能的多种目标的：1）以更好的价格在秘密下出售这些公司的外国投资者；2）因为巨大的纳税人责任，恢复公众对这些公司可行性的信心；3）给人们一种错觉，即信贷风险不再是一个问题；4）最有可能的-政府/美联储/高盛意识到正在发生的新的信贷事件，他们希望在崩溃之前尽可能地提高这些垃圾金融公司的价格。就我个人而言，我认为这四种可能性都有可能，我认为那些认为主要信贷事件不再可能的人是非常幼稚的，他们并没有真正理解信贷市场实际处于的情况的本质。银行在过去几个月里慢慢增加了他们的杠杆和风险偏好，而他们的影子资产（3级）现在被隐藏在GAAP财务报表之外，没有人知道背景中隐藏了什么恶行。在我看来，银行应该减少杠杆，而不是重新杠杆化，因为他们一开始就过于杠杆化，无法应对任何问题。在垃圾金融公司中表现出来的规模的变动充满了掩盖某事的绝望。VIX和日元最近创下20天的高位，表明可能出了什么问题。我闻到了烟味，当你闻到烟味时，可能有火灾发生。  '
