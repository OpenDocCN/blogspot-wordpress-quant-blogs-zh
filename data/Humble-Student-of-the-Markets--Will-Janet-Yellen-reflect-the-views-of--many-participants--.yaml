  zh: 尽管如此，**许多参与者**建议，在开始政策正常化之前，他们需要看到劳动力市场状况进一步改善，以及指向实际活动持续以足够支持劳动力市场进一步收益的步伐增长的数据。**许多参与者**表示，这样的经济条件将有助于增强他们对通胀在能源价格和其他因素的暂时影响消散后朝着委员会2%的目标移动的可能性。**一些参与者**指出，他们对通胀回归2%的信心也将因核心PCE通胀稳定或上升，或替代序列（如修剪均值或中值通胀衡量）而得到加强。**许多参与者**强调，他们需要看到市场基础通胀补偿上升，或者继续低读数不构成担忧的理由。**几位参与者**表示，劳动力补偿改善的迹象将是重要的信号，而其他人则认为，鉴于工资与价格通胀之间在短期内松散的实证联系，劳动力补偿数据在判断通胀压力初期阶段的价值不大。

    for the beginning of policy firming toward an unduly narrow range of dates. As
    a result, ***some expressed*** the concern that financial markets might overreact,

    possible communications by which they might further underscore the data dependency
    of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy. ***A
    number of participants*** noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful
    tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization
    approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could
    provide about its timing. Looking ahead, ***some participants*** highlighted the
    potential benefits of streamlining the Committee's postmeeting statement once
    normalization has begun. More broadly, it was suggested that the Committee should
    communicate clearly that policy decisions will be data dependent, and that unanticipated
    economic developments could therefore warrant a path of the federal funds rate
    different from that currently expected by investors or policymakers.
