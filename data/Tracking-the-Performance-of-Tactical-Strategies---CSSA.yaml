- en: 'There is a [cool new website](https://allocatesmartly.com/) that tracks the
    performance of well-known tactical strategies. [AllocateSmartly](https://allocatesmartly.com/) 
    has collected an extensive list of strategies from well-known hedge fund managers
    like Ray Dalio along with several other portfolio managers and financial bloggers.
    The backtests for these strategies use a very detailed and comprehensive method
    that is both conservative and realistic. Where possible, the author uses tradeable
    assets rather than indices and factors in transaction costs along with careful
    treatment of dividends. The current allocations and performance are tracked in
    real-time which allows investors to be able to realistically trade these portfolios.
    Curiously the best performing model tracked on the website this year is the [Minimum
    Correlation Algorithm](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/minimum-correlation-algorithm-mca/)
    from CSSA which says a lot about the importance of diversification in 2016 versus
    momentum and managing risk via trend-following/time-series momentum. In fact,
    if you dig deeper you will notice that most of the best performers have a structural
    or dynamic diversification element. The worst performers have been the most concentrated
    and oriented toward identifying the best performers. As the website correctly
    points out- the diversification oriented strategies tend to do well during normal
    market conditions but ultimately the dynamic and more tactical strategies outperform
    during bear markets. Over longer backtest periods, the more truly tactical performers
    had better long-term performance. Different market regimes will reward different
    approaches depending on how predictable and interrelated the markets happen to
    be that year. An umbrella is great for a rain storm but less than ideal for a
    sunny day. That is why it is important to understand the strategies you are following
    and why you are investing in them rather than blindly chase performance. While
    many quant developers and investors chase the best looking equity curves it is
    important to consider two primary factors: 1) the utility curve that works best
    for any one individual is a very personal choice (ie risk/reward and tracking
    error) 2) you need to choose a set of assumptions for capital markets either going
    forward or over the long-term: will returns, correlations or volatility be predictable
    and if so which will be the most predictable and why.'

  zh: 有一个[很酷的新网站](https://allocatesmartly.com/)可以追踪知名战术策略的表现。 [AllocateSmartly](https://allocatesmartly.com/)
    收集了大量来自知名对冲基金经理如雷·达里奥以及其他几位投资组合经理和金融博主的研究策略。这些策略的回测使用了一种非常详细和全面的方法，既保守又现实。在可能的情况下，作者使用可交易的资产而不是指数和因子，并考虑到交易成本以及对股息的仔细处理。当前的分配和表现实时跟踪，这使得投资者能够现实地交易这些投资组合。有趣的是，今年网站追踪表现最好的模型是
    CSSA 的[最小相关算法](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/minimum-correlation-algorithm-mca/)，这充分说明了
    2016 年分散投资的重要性相对于动量和通过趋势跟随/时间序列动量管理风险。事实上，如果你更深入地挖掘，你会注意到大多数表现最佳的投资策略都具有结构或动态分散元素。表现最差的投资策略是最集中和致力于识别最佳表现者的。正如网站正确指出的那样——分散投资策略在正常市场条件下通常表现良好，但在熊市中，动态和更战术的策略表现更佳。在较长的回测期间，更真正战术性的策略具有更好的长期表现。不同的市场制度将根据市场的可预测性和相互关联性当年奖励不同的方法。雨伞在暴风雨中很好用，但在晴朗的日子里却不理想。这就是了解你所追随的策略以及你为什么要投资它们而不是盲目追求业绩的重要性，而不是盲目追求业绩。尽管许多量化开发者和投资者追求看起来最好的股票曲线，但重要的是要考虑两个主要因素：1)
    对任何一个人来说最有效的效用曲线是一个非常重要的个人选择（即风险/回报和跟踪误差）2) 你需要为资本市场选择一组假设，无论是向前还是长期：回报、相关性或波动性是否可预测，如果可以，哪个最可预测，为什么。
- en: On a side note, I was informed that the very popular “[A Simple Tactical ](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/)[Asset
    Allocation Strategy with Percentile Channels](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/)”
    by CSSA is also being added to the AllocateSmartly website very soon. This is
    a tactical and structural diversification hybrid that provides balanced factor
    risk with the ability to de-risk during market downturns. While it lacks the higher
    returns of more momentum-oriented or equity-centric strategies it provides a steady
    and low-risk profile across market conditions.

  zh: 顺便提一下，我被告知非常受欢迎的“[简单战术资产分配策略](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/)”即将加入AllocateSmartly网站。这是一种战术和结构多元化的混合策略，在市场下跌时能够降低风险的同时提供平衡的因子风险。虽然它不像更偏向动量或以股权为中心的策略那样收益高，但它能为各种市场状况提供稳定和低风险的配置。
