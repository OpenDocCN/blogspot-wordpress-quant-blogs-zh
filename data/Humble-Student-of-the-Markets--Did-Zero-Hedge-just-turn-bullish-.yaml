    Movements in 10-year Treasury notes are telling the same story. Last summer, 10-year
    yields were rising because investors saw a tighter Fed. Now they’re falling. Investors
    seem to be reading a string of soft economic data – weaker car sales, a manufacturing
    slowdown, disappointing job growth – and concluding the economic coast is not
    as clear as it appeared just a few weeks ago.

  zh: 简而言之，市场现在预计美联储将大幅放宽政策，而不是更加紧缩。10年期国债票据的走势讲述了同一个故事。去年夏天，10年期收益率上升是因为投资者看到了一个更紧缩的美联储。现在它们正在下降。投资者似乎正在解读一系列软性经济数据——汽车销售疲软、制造业放缓、令人失望的就业增长——并得出结论，经济前景并不像几周前看起来那么明朗。

    too easy. Indeed, we would hope that they would only be tapering in the context
    of a rising interest rate environment as it would suggest that market participants
    were anticipating higher growth and inflation. But the Fed doesn't see it that
    way. They see lower rates as a signal that policy is easier. And hence are not
    inclined to react to ease policy further by stopping the taper.
