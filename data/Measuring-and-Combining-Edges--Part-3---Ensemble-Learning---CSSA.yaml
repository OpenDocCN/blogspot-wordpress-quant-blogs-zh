    more complex than simple prediction models used in other fields. If physicists
    cannot definitively place the exact location of an electron, than what hope do
    we have of doing a one-time regression model on the S&P500 and basing our investing
    decisions on that? Yet this is what a lot of people like to do—borne out of our
    primitive abilities to understand randomness and complex systems. A good model
    to address the nature of  financial markets must be: 1) dynamic 2) adaptive 3)
    complex (to account for conditional situations) and 4) recursive. There is only
    one method that can accomplish these goals effectively and that is an ensemble
    learning method.'

  zh: 如果市场是非平稳的，边际出现和消失，那么我们需要比其他领域使用的简单预测模型更复杂的东西。如果物理学家不能确切地确定电子的确切位置，那么我们对标普500进行一次回归模型并在那个基础上做出我们的投资决策又有何希望呢？然而，许多人喜欢这样做——这是出于我们理解随机性和复杂系统的原始能力。要应对金融市场的本质，一个好的模型必须是：1)
    动态的 2) 适应性的 3) 复杂的（以便考虑条件性情况）和 4) 递归的。只有一种方法能有效实现这些目标，那就是集成学习方法。
- en: Ensemble learning methods are analogous to the way decisions are made within
    a large hedge fund. In this case a research team interacts with portfolio managers
    who in turn interact with traders who themselves in turn answer to risk managers.
    The process is also circular where the risk managers talk to the portfolio managers,
    who in turn alter decision making. While the quality of the decisions made in
    this process can vary widely depending on the firm, the process itself  is quite
    sound and would be highly useful if the decision inputs were accurate. This method
    makes tracking thousands of stocks and dozens of major markets a much easier task
    and likely more successful than having one portfolio manager do all the work themselves.
    The accuracy and quality of the decision-making are likely to be superior. Furthermore
    the depth and complexity of analysis are much less constrained within this large
    scale interactive format. No portfolio manager operating alone could account for
    all of the myriad factors that affect even a single stock in real-time. Even if
    time was not an issue, our own mental capacities are incapable of handling too
    many competing variables at once.

  zh: 集成学习方法类似于大型对冲基金中决策的方式。在这种情况下，研究团队与投资组合经理互动，投资组合经理再与交易员互动，交易员反过来又向风险经理汇报。这个过程也是循环的，其中风险经理与投资组合经理交谈，投资组合经理反过来改变决策过程。虽然这个过程中做出的决策质量可能因公司而异，但这个过程本身是相当健全的，如果决策输入是准确的，那么它将非常有用。这种方法使得跟踪成千上万的股票和数十个主要市场变得容易得多，而且比一个投资组合经理独自完成所有工作要成功得多。决策的准确性和质量很可能更优越。此外，在这种大规模的互动格式中，分析的深度和复杂性受到的约束要少得多。没有任何一个单独的投资组合经理能够考虑到影响单一股票的所有众多因素。即使时间不是问题，我们自己的认知能力也不可能同时处理太多竞争性的变量。
- en: This analogy holds true for mathematical prediction problems-  no single regression
    will be able to capture the factors that affect the S&P500 in one equation without
    serious compromise. Even non-linear methods and neural networks are incapable
    of handling all of the mitigating factors at once. This is why many higher order
    prediction models often fail out of sample– they learn everything there is to
    know about how a batch of variables interact without knowing much about how each
    variable actually works. They also fail to generalize. In contrast a commitee
    of models let by a single managing model (ie the portfolio manager) is far more
    likely to succeed in this task. Such a committee is exactly what the field of
    ensemble learning is all about and represents the true key to good prediction.

  zh: 这个类比对于数学预测问题同样适用——没有任何一个回归模型能够在不做严重妥协的情况下，仅用一个方程捕捉到影响标普500的所有因素。即使是非线性方法和神经网络也无法同时处理所有缓解因素。这就是为什么许多高级预测模型经常在样本外失败——它们学习了关于一组变量如何相互作用的全部知识，而对于每个变量实际是如何工作的了解却不多。它们也无法进行泛化。相比之下，由一个管理模型（即投资组合经理）领导的模型委员会更有可能完成这项任务。这样的委员会正是集成学习领域的核心，也是良好预测的关键。
