- en: ': BoA published its monthly Global Fund Manager Survey (FMS) this week and
    the results were not a big surprise. In the last few months, the FMS had increasingly
    become a price momentum indicator whose readings were fairly predictable based
    on recent market trends. Respondent risk appetite was turning up after bottoming
    out in late 2022 and global managers were buying risk again.'

  zh: ': 本周，美银发布了其月度全球基金经理调查（FMS）。结果并不令人意外。最近几个月，FMS increasingly 成为了一个价格动量指标，其读数基于近期市场趋势相当可预测。受访者风险偏好在新年2022年底触底后开始上升，全球经理们再次买入风险资产。'

    (read: China) and eurozone equities and selling US equities, which is consistent
    with what I have observed in my relative return analysis.'

  zh: 在其全球股票配置中，经理们买入新兴市场（读：中国）和欧元区股票，并卖出美国股票，这与我在相对回报分析中观察到的一致。
- en: Hidden beneath these obvious headlines is a far more cautious asset allocation
    positioning that are inconsistent with the macro outlook implied by the risk-on
    nature of the recent equity stampede. A schism is appearing between the how the
    asset allocators view the market and how equity managers view the market.

  zh: 隐藏在这些显而易见的头条之下，是一种与近期股市狂潮的风险偏好性质所暗示的宏观展望不一致的更为谨慎的资产配置定位。资产配置者对市场的看法与股票经理对市场的看法之间出现了裂痕。
