    this anniversary fell just after my [Top Posts of 2011](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/top-posts-of-2011.html)
    entry, it seemed like another retrospective look at the blog might be one too
    many. After a week of reflection I am now convinced that [The 1000^(th) Post](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/1000th-post.html)
    is probably best left unchallenged (for now at least) as my definitive history
    of the ideas represented on this blog and a good reference for relatively new
    readers. Another link worth highlighting is the hopefully self-explanatory [The
    Post of the Month: An Informal History of VIX and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/post-of-month-informal-history-of-vix.html).
    Last but not least, for those interested in the best of the archives, those few

    definitive history 和新读者的良好参考。另一个值得突出的链接是希望不言而喻的[月度最佳文章：VIX and More的非正式历史](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/post-of-month-informal-history-of-vix.html)。最后但并非最不重要的是，对于那些对档案中的最佳文章感兴趣的人来说，那些带有[名人堂](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hall%20of%20fame)标签的几篇文章是我个人最喜欢的。

    benefits from having a title that positions it well for Google searches. There
    are a number of related posts about how to trade the VIX (some of which are links
    in the original), but here is a case where I should also have an updated look
    at the subject, with some more comprehensive information.'

    year it was written (2009) is now in the top three of all time. I believe this
    was the first explanation anywhere went into the details of the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)

    material instead about talking about my trades or what I was expecting from the

    very likely to happen that cut against traditional thinking. This triple ETF call
    was one of those and also helped to attract attention to these new products.'

    – I was surprised to see this post on the last as the analysis is probably not
    among my best thinking. What I believed happened was that at the time this was
    written, investors had become concerned that stocks had rallied too sharply off
    of their March 2009 lows and were likely to run out of steam soon. As it turns
    out, stock sold off for about two weeks after this post, falling back to SPX 869,
    then resumed their bullish momentum.'

    – While I will probably never get a job writing headlines for the New York Post,
    every once in a while my research and analysis uncovers something that has widespread

    (**E**TP **V**olatility **A**nalysis **L**ong-**S**hort) in November. EVALS is
    now focusing on VIX-based ETPs and this has created some confusion from readers
    about what content is on the blog, what is in the newsletter and what is in EVALS.
    For this reason, I have created a content pyramid below which should help to differentiate
    between what can be found where. Of course the blog is free to all, while the
    [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) and EVALS are available

    ETPs，这导致一些读者对于博客上有什么内容，新闻通讯里有什么内容，以及EVALS里有什么内容产生了一些混淆。为此，我下面创建了一个内容的金字塔图，应该有助于区分在这些地方可以找到什么内容。当然，博客对所有人免费开放，而新闻通讯和EVALS只对订阅者开放。
