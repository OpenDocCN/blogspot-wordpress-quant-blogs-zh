    this weekend I was actually also thinking about the philosophy behind factor models
    which you allude to in the post. I am wondering if you have any other thoughts
    as to what service factor models provide? Relegating them to ''just arrogant bets
    on the correctness of the managers'' convictions'' isn’t completely intellectually
    satisfying to me.'

  zh: 关于你的博客文章，“[罗宾汉时代](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2007/08/robin-hood-regime.html)”：这个周末，我实际上也在思考你在文章中暗示的因子模型的背后哲学。我想知道你是否还有关于因子模型提供的服务的其他想法？将它们归结为“只是经理信念正确的傲慢赌注”对我来说并不完全令人满意。
- en: 'I look at factors as such: the returns I get for exposure to various factors
    can come either because the market is inefficient and systematically misprices
    those factors (alpha), and/or because I am providing some service via the exposure
    (and collecting some kind of risk premium associated with that service). My question
    #1 to you is, are you convinced that all of the returns to factor models are indeed
    simply from risk premiums and not alpha? If alpha exists, it’s less clear that
    a service needs to be provided to the market, at least to me.'

  zh: 在我看来，因子可以这样理解：我所获得的因子暴露的回报，可能是因为市场效率低下，系统性地错误定价了这些因子（阿尔法），以及/或者因为我提供了一些服务，并收取与该服务相关的某种风险溢价。我给你的第一个问题是，你是否确信因子模型的所有回报确实仅仅来自风险溢价，而不是阿尔法？如果存在阿尔法，至少对我来说，提供给市场某种服务就不那么明确了。
- en: 'However, let’s assume (as I believe your boss did) that in the long run, the
    market is efficient. Then, you will be compensated for factor exposure only by
    bearing some risk or providing some service. In my mind, some particular conviction
    of a manager doesn’t necessarily qualify for a risk factor in and of itself -
    I think we agree on that point. But are there possible fundamental, valuation-based
    explanations behind these factors? Perhaps low VALUE companies are generally those
    companies with bad recent performance but which are expected to turnaround / mean-revert
    (as you somewhat suggest in your post) and the risk you bear when buying a low
    P/E company is “turnaround risk”. Or perhaps high MOMENTUM companies are companies
    riding an industry trend and you are bearing “trend continuation risk”. So, my
    question #2 to you is, are you convinced that there are no such explanations?'

  zh: 然而，让我们假设（正如我相信你的老板所做的那样）从长远来看，市场是有效的。那么，你将因承担因子暴露而获得补偿，只是承担一些风险或提供一些服务。在我心中，经理的某种特定信念并不一定本身就构成了一个风险因子——我认为我们在这一点上达成了共识。但这些因子背后可能有潜在的、基于估值的解释吗？也许低价值公司的普遍情况是那些表现不佳但预计会反转/均值回归的公司（正如你在帖子中暗示的那样），而购买低市盈率公司的风险是“反转风险”。或者，也许高动量公司是那些顺应行业趋势的公司，而你承担的是“趋势延续风险”。所以，我给你的第二个问题是，你是否确信没有这样的解释？
- en: If factor models do indeed work, it seems to me that there must either be real
    risks behind the factors, or alpha, or both."

  zh: 如果因子模型确实有效，那么我认为背后必须有真正的风险、阿尔法，或者两者都有。

  zh: 以下是我的回复：
- en: '"I believe the service that some value factors provide is the efficient allocation
    of capital to those companies that deserve them, just like any value investors
    do. In this case, the factors hope to identify these companies faster than humans
    can, and therefore bring capital to them sooner. I have no argument with these
    factors as they also provide liquidity, albeit on a longer time-scale. However,
    with regard to various momentum factors, they are in fact just betting on certain
    behavioral characteristics of investors, or on the slow dissemination of news,
    etc. You can argue that they provide a service by improving the efficiency with
    which information about companies disseminate. But the problem is that once everybody
    are using these momentum factors, the market becomes efficient and any further
    bets generate losses.'

  zh: 我认为某些价值因子提供的服务就是高效地将资本分配给那些值得它们的公司，就像任何价值投资者所做的。在这种情况下，这些因子希望比人类更快地识别出这些公司，因此更快地将资本带给它们。我对这些因子没有异议，因为它们也提供了流动性，尽管是在更长的时间尺度上。然而，关于各种动量因子，它们实际上只是在赌投资者的一些行为特征，或者是在新闻的缓慢传播等。你可以争辩说，它们通过提高公司信息传播的效率来提供服务。但问题是，一旦每个人都使用这些动量因子，市场就会变得有效，任何进一步的投注都会产生损失。
- en: So I am quite willing to accept that many of these (momentum) factors represent
    alpha, but these factors are generating more losses as more investors employ them.
    I am also willing to accept that many of the (value) factors represent risk premia.
    As more investors employ these, the profit goes to zero, but fortunately not negative
    as the risk also disappears."

  zh: 所以我很乐意接受许多这些（动量）因子代表阿尔法，但随着更多投资者使用它们，这些因子产生的损失也在增加。我也愿意接受许多（价值）因子代表风险溢价。随着更多投资者使用这些因子，利润会减少到零，但幸运的是不会变成负数，因为风险也消失了。
