    I chronicled the first year of the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, known
    to most by its ticker symbol, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).
    At the time, I noted that VXX had fallen 68.4% in its first year and made the
    prediction, “I expect VXX to perform better relative to the VIX in its second
    year than it did in its first year, though admittedly this is not a very high
    bar to clear.”'

  zh: '一年前的今天，在[Chart of the Week: VXX Celebrates One Year of Futility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/01/chart-of-week-vxx-celebrates-one-year.html)一文中，我记录了iPath
    S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN（大多数情况下以其股票代码VXX为人所知）的第一年。当时，我注意到VXX在其第一个年度下跌了68.4%，并做出了预测，“我预计VXX在其第二年的表现会相对于VIX表现得更好，尽管承认这并不是一个很高的门槛。”'
- en: Well, low bar or not, the performance of VXX was even worse in its second year
    than in its first year. In spite of the fact that VXX rallied 8.4% on Friday to
    close out the second year on a high note, its performance in the second year slipped
    to -74.6%, giving the ETN the dubious distinction of having fallen 92% since its
    launch two years ago.

  zh: 好吧，无论低门槛与否，VXX在其第二年的表现甚至比第一年还要糟糕。尽管VXX在第二个交易日上涨了8.4%，以高昂的气氛结束了第二年，但其第二年的表现下滑至-74.6%，使得这个ETN自两年前成立以来下跌了92%。
- en: 'While I have been chronicling the shortcomings of VXX for the better part of
    these past two years, let me go on record as saying that VXX does exactly what
    it sets out to do: capture a portfolio of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    with a constant maturity of 30 days, with daily rolling used in order to achieve
    the constant maturity. As detailed in the links below and in many other places
    in this blog, it is the daily rolling in the face of persistent [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    which triggers negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    and acts as a drag on the price of VXX. In fact, VIX futures contango has been
    extremely elevated since the end of August, which largely explains why VXX lost
    74.6% in the past year when the VIX declined only 18.6%. To compare the contango
    impact of the second year of VXX with the first year, all one needs to know is
    that in the first year VIX outperformed VXX by 26.2%, while in the year just concluded,
    VIX outperformed VXX by a whopping 56.0%.'

  zh: 虽然我在过去两年里一直在记录VXX的不足之处，但让我明确地说，VXX确实做到了它旨在做的事情：捕获一个持续期限为30天的[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)组合，通过每日滚动来实现这一持续期限。正如下面链接和本博客其他许多地方所详细说明的，正是面对持续的[正向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)时产生的每日滚动触发了负的[滚动收益率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)，对VXX的价格产生了拖累。实际上，自从去年8月底以来，VIX期货的正向市场一直非常高，这很大程度上解释了为什么在VIX仅下跌18.6%的情况下，VXX在过去一年里下跌了74.6%。要比较VXX第二年与第一年的正向市场影响，只需知道第一年VIX的表现优于VXX
    26.2%，而在刚刚结束的一年里，VIX的表现优于VXX高达56.0%。
- en: This does not mean that investors should shun VIX as a volatility trade. In
    the short-term, VXX is a viable long volatility play, as evidenced by Friday’s
    8.4% gain. When the VIX futures curve slides from contango to [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation),
    VXX can also be an attractive trade. The problems on the long side begin when
    investors utilize holding periods of more than a couple of days. In the long run,
    volatility is [mean-reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    and offers no natural directional advantage. For this reason, the longer the holding
    period, the more VXX trades become [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    rather than directional trades, with the term structure favoring contango over
    backwardation approximately 75% of the time.

  zh: 这并不意味着投资者应该回避VIX作为波动性交易。从短期来看，VXX是一个可行的做多波动性的交易，正如周五的8.4%的涨幅所证明的那样。当VIX期货曲线从正向市场转为[反向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)时，VXX也可能成为一个有吸引力的交易。当投资者持有的期限超过几天时，做多方面的问题就开始了。从长远来看，波动性是[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)的，并且不提供任何自然的方向性优势。因此，持有期限越长，VXX交易就越成为[期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)而非方向性交易，而期限结构在正向市场和反向市场之间大约有75%的时间更倾向于正向市场。
- en: 'With this in mind, I will repeat the same prediction I made one year ago, undaunted:
    VXX will perform better relative to the VIX in the coming year than it has in
    the past year.'

  zh: 有了这个想法，我将重复我一年前做出的同样的预测，毫不畏惧：VXX在未来一年的表现将优于过去一年相对于VIX的表现。
