    and "Trump gushed about Taylor after his interview", as "Kevin Warsh has...seen
    his star fade within the White House". The current list of leading candidates
    under consider are said to be Jerome Powell, John Taylor, Kevin Warsh, and Janet
    Yellen. Taylor's rise in the candidate stakes is a bit of a surprise, as he had
    been regarded as a dark horse.

    Warsh和珍妮特·耶伦。泰勒在候选人中的崛起有些令人意外，因为他一直被视为一个黑马。

  zh: The question for investors is, "What would a Taylor Fed look like?"
- en: Taylor is famous for the "Taylor Rule", which is a rules-based method of determining
    the Fed Funds rate. The rules-based approach is a favorite of the Republican audit-the-Fed
    crowd, and therefore Taylor will have substantial support should he get nominated.
    The standard application of the Taylor Rule would see the Fed Funds target substantially
    higher than it is today.

    support。泰勒规则的常规应用将使联邦基金目标利率大大高于目前的水位。

    Macro LLC in Washington. “In fact, he won’t be able to persuade hardly anyone

    in the Wall Street Journal explaining that forcing the Federal Open Market Committee
    (FOMC) to mechanically follow a rule, such as the Taylor rule, to set interest
    rates can cause tremendous harm to the economy and the American people. My staff
    at the Minneapolis Fed estimates that if the FOMC had followed the Taylor rule
    over the past five years, 2.5 million more Americans would be out of work today.
    That’s enough to fill the seats at all 31 NFL stadiums simultaneously, almost
    6,000 more people out of work in every congressional district.
