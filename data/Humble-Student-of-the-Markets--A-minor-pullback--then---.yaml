- en: After the SPX tested all-time highs on Wednesday, it was not surprising to see
    the major US stock market averages pull back on Thursday. The decline was surprisingly
    light. What I found supportive of the bull case was the upside breakouts shown
    by the high-beta leadership such as the NASDAQ and small caps.

  zh: 在SPX在周三测试历史新高后，看到美国主要股市平均指数在周四回调并不令人意外。跌幅出乎意料的轻微。我发现支持看涨情况的是，像纳斯达克和小型股这样的高贝塔领导股所显示的上涨突破。
- en: Consider, for example, the chart below of the NASDAQ 100\. Not only did the
    upside breakout hold, the index went on to further new highs on Thursday. However,
    these upside breakouts were staged on falling volume, which suggests that a near-term
    pullback may be necessary before stock prices move to sustainable new highs.

  zh: 例如，考虑下面纳斯达克100的图表。不仅上涨突破得以保持，该指数在周四继续创下新高。然而，这些上涨突破是在成交量下降的情况下出现的，这表明在股票价格持续创新高之前，可能需要短期回调。
- en: This chart of the Russell 2000 small cap ETF (IWM) shows a similar pattern of
    further breakouts on Thursday, but on low volume.

- en: On an intermediate term basis, cyclical stocks remain in a relative uptrend
    compared to the broad market, indicating that Mr. Market still believes that economic
    growth is undergoing a period of acceleration.

  zh: 从中期来看，周期性股票相对于整个市场仍处于相对上升趋势，这表明市场先生仍认为经济增长正在经历加速期。
- en: This week is option expiry week, which tends to have an upward bias. The week
    after option expiry has tended to have a negative bias for the market. The current
    market action is highly suggestive of a minor pullback next week.

  zh: 本周是期权到期周，往往具有上涨倾向。期权到期后的一周市场往往倾向于负面。当前的市场行为高度暗示下周可能会出现小幅回调。
- en: Even though my base case calls for further highs in stock prices, I am cognizant
    of a bear case for equities. If the forecast weakness were to occur next week,
    I would closely watch sentiment model readings for direction.

- en: correctly pointed out that sentiment models showing a crowded long reading.
    If bullishness were to pull back with prices, then I would see that as a green
    light to go long. On the other hand, if the level of bullishness were to stay
    stubbornly high, then it would be a warning that an intermediate term market top
    may be in place.

  zh: 正确指出情绪模型显示多头拥挤的读数。如果看涨情绪随着价格回调而减弱，那么我会把这看作是做多绿灯。另一方面，如果看涨情绪顽固地保持高位，那么这将是一个警告，可能是中期市场顶部已经形成。
