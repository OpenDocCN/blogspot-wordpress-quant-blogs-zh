- en: The speed with which the yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note dropped from
    just over 4.00% in early April to just 2.68% as of Friday’s close is astonishing
    – and points to how the bond market is evaluating the prospects for deflation,
    recession and a prolonged economic malaise, or worse.

  zh: 美国10年期国债收益率从4月初的略高于4.00%骤降至周五收盘时的2.68%的速度令人震惊——这指向了债券市场如何评估通货紧缩、衰退和长期经济萧条，或更糟的前景。
- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    captures the history of the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note
    since 1990, when it was hovering in the vicinity of 9%. For additional context
    I have also included a gray area chart of the S&P 500 index. More often than not,
    yields on the long bond are positively correlated with equities, but this relationship
    can decouple, sometimes for an extended period of time.
