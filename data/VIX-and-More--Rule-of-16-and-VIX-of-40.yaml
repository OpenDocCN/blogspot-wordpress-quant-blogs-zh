- en: After a year or so of almost uninterrupted falling volatility, the last few
    weeks have seen a surge in the VIX and other measures of volatility. In fact the
    VIX more than tripled in a little over a month, jumping from an April 12 low of
    15.23 to a May 21 high of 48.20.

  zh: 在几乎不受干扰地持续下降了一年左右的波动性之后，最近几周VIX和其他波动性衡量指标出现了激增。事实上，在不到一个月的时间里，VIX从4月12日的低点15.23激增至5月21日的高点48.20。
- en: One way to come to terms with the current 40ish level in the VIX is to think
    in terms of daily percentage changes in the underlying, the S&P 500 index. Technically,
    the VIX represents one standard deviation of the market’s estimation of changes
    in the price of the SPX during the next 30 days. The VIX number is the size of
    that standard deviation in annual percentage terms, but since volatility is a
    function of the square root of time, in order to translate that annual standard
    deviation number into a daily number, one has to divide by the square root of
    the number of trading days in a year. A year typically has about 252 trading days
    and the square root of 252 is 15.87, which options traders generally round up
    to 16 in their head. Hence the “[Rule of 16](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rule%20of%2016).”

  zh: 要理解VIX目前约40的水平，一种方法是考虑标普500指数的日常百分比变化。从技术角度看，VIX代表市场预计未来30天内SPX价格变化的其中一个标准差。VIX的数字是以年度百分比形式表示的那个标准差的大小，但由于波动性是时间的平方根的函数，为了将这个年度标准差数字转换为日常数字，你必须除以一年中交易日的平方根。一年通常有大约252个交易日，252的平方根是15.87，期权交易员通常在脑海中四舍五入到16。因此就有了“[16法则](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rule%20of%2016)”。
- en: Using 16 makes it easy to do some quick math in one’s head. If the VIX is at
    16, as it was a little over a month ago, one would expect that 68.2% of the time
    (one standard deviation), the daily change in the SPX would be 1% or less and
    31.8% of the time it would be 1% or more. To simplify the math even more, options
    traders often make the mental conversion of 68.2% to two thirds. Since traders
    are generally more concerned about big moves than small ones, they tend to focus
    on the outlier portion of the standard deviation calculation, the one third of
    trading days which are more volatile than normal.

  zh: 使用16可以让人在脑海中快速进行一些简单计算。如果VIX是16，就像一个月前那样，你期望1个标准差（68.2%的时间），SPX的每日变化会小于或等于1%，而31.8%的时间它会大于1%。为了使计算更加简单，期权交易员通常会将68.2%的心理转换为三分之二。由于交易员通常更关心大幅波动而不是小幅波动，他们往往会关注标准差计算中的异常值部分，即比正常情况更波动的1/3交易天数。

    around 40, options traders are expecting that the SPX will have daily change of
    2.5% about 1/3 of the time.

  zh: 简单的数学允许我们进行线性插值。今天，VIX围绕40波动，期权交易员预计SPX将有1/3的时间出现每日2.5%的变化。
- en: Looking backward, as volatile as the market have been recently, only three days
    out of the past month have resulted in daily changes of 2.5% or more. In fact,
    for all of 2010, there have been only four days in which the SPX has been either
    up or down at least 2.5%.

  zh: 回顾过去，尽管市场最近非常波动，但过去一个月里只有三天导致日常变化超过2.5%。事实上，在整个2010年，只有四天SPX的涨跌超过2.5%。
- en: In terms of conclusions, either market volatility is about to increase substantially
    from current levels or options traders have overestimated future volatility. As
    bearish as today has been, the SPX is “only” down 1.6% as I type this. If we have
    one or two more days in which stocks show average to slightly higher than usual
    volatility, expect the VIX to begin to move back down to a level that is a better
    reflection of those daily moves.

  zh: 就结论而言，市场波动性要么即将从当前水平大幅上升，要么期权交易者高估了未来的波动性。尽管今天市场情绪悲观，但标普500指数（SPX）在我撰写这篇文章时“仅”下跌了1.6%。如果我们再有一两天，股票显示出平均水平或略高于平常的波动性，预计VIX将开始回落到更能反映那些日常波动的水平。
