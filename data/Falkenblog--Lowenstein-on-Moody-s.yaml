- en: '[the loans] were originated by a West Coast company that Moody''s identified
    as a ''nonbank lender.''... Moody’s learned that almost half of these borrowers
    — 43 percent — did not provide written verification of their incomes...half of
    the borrowers, however, took out a simultaneous second loan. Most often, their
    two loans added up to all their property''s presumed resale value, which meant
    the borrowers had not a cent of equity.'

- en: Moody's qualified this by noting these people had good credit scores, and these
    were generally their primary residences, so they thought it was safe. But 43%
    with no income verification? Half the borrowers had no equity in the game? Issued
    by a nonbank lender, meaning, someone without any large franchise value, and so
    he has little too lose when these things tank? That's picture perfect bad underwriting.
    I think the first thing to do isn't to adjust the algorithm, but do drug testing,
    because ignoring these details is like missing a fly ball because you were staring
    at the shiny lights on the ceiling.

- en: These people, the mortgage recipients, the originators, had no skin in the game,
    and so, clearly had an incentive to take a bet on housing via a lax securitization
    process. When I worked for a bank, one needed 20% down payment to get a mortgage.
    After all, the first rule of banking is to only give loans to people who don't
    need them. This is a common joke, but the plain fact is, you should be reasonably
    sure that nonpayments are implausible, because estimating losses that are significant
    gets you into equity, not debt. The only exception is consumer loans, like credit
    card, and there we have millions of observations, and so one can expect to lose
    5% a year, but with an 18% interest rate, it's tolerable. When you have no money
    in the house, a 10% fall in housing prices implies significant defaults, leading
    to the new territory, as we are finding out. If borrowers had 20% down and income
    verification, there would not be this problem.

  zh: 这些人，按揭接受者，发起者，在这场游戏中没有贡献，因此显然有动机通过宽松的证券化过程来下注房地产。当我在银行工作时，需要20%的首付才能获得抵押贷款。毕竟，银行业的第一条规则就是只向不需要贷款的人提供贷款。这是一个常见的笑话，但明显事实是，你应该对不可能不付款感到相当有把握，因为估计损失是严重的，你会进入股权，而不是债务。唯一的例外是消费者贷款，如信用卡，那里我们有数百万条观察，所以可以预期每年损失5%，但以18%的利率，这是可以接受的。当你在房子里没有钱时，房价下跌10%意味着显著的违约，导致新的领土，正如我们正在发现的那样。如果借款人首付20%并进行收入验证，就不会有这个问题。
- en: Moody's calculated an expected loss over the lifetime of the CDO of 4.9%, but
    only a year later, 13% of the loans were delinquent. In April 2007, Moody's announced
    it was revising its model used to evaluate subprime mortgages, but the horse was
    out of the barn. As Mark Adelson noted, Moody's statistical approach, applied
    to these very novel underwriting standards, was 'like observing 100 years of weather
    in Antartica to forecast the weather in Hawaii'. If ever the 'ceteris paribus'
    assumption didn't hold, this was it. Whoever led this group at Moody's should
    be fired.

    Adelson所指出的那样，Moody's应用于这些非常新颖的贷款标准的统计方法“就像观察南极100年的天气来预测夏威夷的天气”，如果“其他都不变”的假设从未存在，

    good grades, especially when issuers shop ratings, looking for a good grader,
    who then gets this business. So one solution is to have investors, not issuers,

- en: Rating is a scale game, and it's efficient for one or two groups to specialize
    in these things, give one grade, so people don't needlessly duplicate the same
    function. I don't see how you can get around issuers paying. But it would be useful
    to mandate that all Moody's performance data is warehoused at the government,
    and have someone at the Fed publish the default data for Moody's, S&P, Fitch,
    and the rest. That is, in compensation for being a Nationally Recognized Rating
    agency, a valuable designation given to only a handful of companies, they need
    an objective scorecard that will adversely impact their stock price if they screw
    up. In this case, Moody's ratings on structured finance clearly isn't worth that
    much right now, and they really have to earn that back their credibility in this
    area.

  zh: 评级是一个比赛游戏，有一两个团体专门从事这些事情并给出一个评级，这样可以避免人们不必要地重复相同的功能。我不明白你们如何能避免发行人支付报酬。但是，强制要求所有穆迪的绩效数据储存在政府机构，并由联邦储备委员会的工作人员发布穆迪、标普、惠誉等的违约数据将是很有用的。也就是说，作为具有重大国家认可的评级机构的补偿，这一宝贵的资格只授予少数几家公司，他们需要一个客观的记分卡，如果他们搞砸了，会对他们的股价造成不利影响。在这种情况下，目前穆迪公司对结构融资的评级显然并不值得这么多，他们真的需要在这个领域重新获得自己的信誉。
- en: Currently, the rating agencies keep tabs on themselves via their default studies,
    and this information is too important, and too valuable, to have the agencies
    grade themselves. For example, Joseph Mason of Drexel University finds that CDOs
    defaulted eight times the rate of corporates for Baa ratings--a massive miss.
    Documenting this performance would hold Moody's accountable, as those in charge
    would know that if any group started to wreck the statistical validity of their
    ratings, it would cost them. There residential mortgage mistake is not merely
    a minor mistake, but reflects a profound lack of judgment on something fundamental--incentives.

  zh: 目前，评级机构通过其违约研究来监督自身，并且这些信息太重要、太宝贵，不能由这些机构自行评定。例如，德雷塞尔大学的约瑟夫·梅森发现，对于Baa评级，CDO的违约率是企业违约率的8倍，这是一个巨大的错误。记录这一表现将使穆迪公司承担责任，因为掌管者会知道，如果任何一组人开始破坏其评级的统计有效性，这将会让他们付出代价。这种住宅抵押贷款的错误不仅仅是一个小错误，而且反映出对基本事物——激励措施——的深刻判断不足。
- en: 'But as the article notes, what is the alternative? I''m sure the Feds, if they
    monitored it, would have a different set of incentive problems, more intractable.
    There is a huge franchise value to being independent, accurate, analysts of these
    issues, and so I think Moody''s and their competitors will figure this out, but
    if this carrot is not sufficient, I don''t see the next best solution. We don''t
    merely want excess caution, because a rating that is excessively pessimistic is
    just as misinformative as one that is too easy: soon people will dismiss cautions
    because they are perceived, correctly, as too harsh. The worst result would for
    Moody''s, or some new organization, merely make everything be bullet proof to
    get a rating, because then we would have a bunch of AAA rated paper, rated between
    AAA and BB, and this would merely then be noise, constrain credit, and not be
    an equilibrium solution.'

  zh: 但正如文章所指出的，还有什么其他的选择？我相信，如果联邦政府监督此事，他们就会有一套不同的激励问题，更加棘手。独立的、准确的分析这些问题具有巨大的特许权价值，因此我认为穆迪公司及其竞争对手会想出解决办法，但如果仅以这种奖励方式不足以解决问题，我看不到下一个最好的解决方案。我们不仅仅想要过度谨慎，因为过度悲观的评级和过于宽松的评级一样具有误导性：很快人们会因为被正确地认为过于苛刻而对警告产生麻木。最糟糕的结果将是，穆迪公司或某个新组织为了获得评级，必须使所有的事情都无懈可击，因此我们将会有一堆范围在AAA到BB之间的AAA评级的债务票据，而这仅仅会是噪音，限制信贷，而且并不是一个均衡解决方案。
