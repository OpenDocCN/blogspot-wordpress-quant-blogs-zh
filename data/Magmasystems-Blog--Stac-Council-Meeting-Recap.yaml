- en: On July 30th, 2008, Stac Research had a general meeting of Stac Council members
    and associated vendors. Bob from Deutsche Bank was the generous host who managed
    to procure the Deutsche auditorium for the event.

  zh: 2008年7月30日，Stac Research举行了Stac Council成员和关联供应商的全体会议。来自德意志银行的Bob是这位慷慨的主人，他设法为此次活动预订了德意志银行的礼堂。
- en: There was a really good turnout given the fact that it was a hot summer's night
    in prime vacation season. Peter told me that about 175 people said that they would
    attend, and I would estimate the final figure at around 100 people.

  zh: 考虑到那天是炎热的夏日，正值度假旺季，会议的出席率真的很高。Peter告诉我大约175人表示他们将参加，我认为最终人数大约是100人。

  zh: 活动分为三部分。
- en: Stac had invited 10 vendors to give (exactly) 5 minute pitches on their products.
    The vendors that presented included IBM, HP, Sun, Solace, Tervela, Violin, Azul,
    Exegy, ServerEngines, and Bay Micro. All presented their solution for HPC on Wall
    Street. (Not a single mention of .NET that night .... where were you, Microsoft,
    and why aren't you on the Stac Council?)

  zh: Stac邀请了10家供应商为他们产品做（确切地）5分钟的演讲。进行演讲的供应商包括IBM、HP、Sun、Solace、Tervela、Violin、Azul、Exegy、ServerEngines和Bay
    Micro。所有供应商都展示了他们为华尔街的高性能计算解决方案。那天晚上没有一个人提到.NET……微软，你在哪里，为什么你不在Stac Council上？
- en: There were two short presentations on the current state of the Stac M1 (Market
    Data) and E1 (Event Processing) working groups, given by Rob Wallos of Citi and
    yours truly.

  zh: 有两个简短的演讲，分别是关于Stac M1（市场数据）和E1（事件处理）工作组的当前状态，由Citi的Rob Wallos和本人主讲。
- en: Following the presentations was a cocktail hour, where there was actually a
    DeutscheBank labeled red wine! Everyone saw a lot of old Wall Street faces, ex-bosses,
    former colleagues, competitors, etc, and it was nice to reminisce with some of
    the folks who I haven't seen for years.

  zh: 演讲结束后是鸡尾酒会，实际上还有一瓶标有德意志银行字样的红酒！每个人都看到了很多老华尔街的面孔，前老板、前同事、竞争对手等，和一些我已经几年没见的人一起回忆往事很不错。
- en: Several people from the large vendors approached me with questions about how
    they could join the Stac A1 working group. What it seems to me is that CEP still
    needs a lot of publicity, as people are not exactly sure about how to approach
    it. Only Ralph Frankel from Solace acknowledged the existence of CEP in his presentation,
    and offered a solution about how Solace can accelerate CEP-based apps. Solace
    is certainly a company that is on my radar, as it has been mentioned to me by
    several colleagues.

  zh: 来自一些大型供应商的几个人向我提出了关于他们如何加入Stac A1工作组的问题。在我看来，事件处理（CEP）仍然需要大量的宣传，因为人们并不是很清楚如何入手。只有Solace的Ralph
    Frankel在演讲中承认了CEP的存在，并提供了一种关于Solace如何加速基于CEP的应用的解决方案。Solace无疑是一家在我关注范围内的公司，因为有好几位同事向我提到了它。
- en: It's my opinion that, if a company really has a compelling HPC solution for
    Wall Street, membership in Stac is mandatory. Eventually, non-members will be
    conspicuous by their absence.

  zh: 我认为，如果一家公司真的为华尔街提供了一个有吸引力的高性能计算（HPC）解决方案，那么加入Stac是必须的。最终，非会员将会因为他们的缺席而显得突兀。
