    not only since the March bottom, but on a year over year basis as well. July volume
    appears likely to come in lower than in 2008\. Since the long-term trend of volume
    has been steadily up I decided to look at other times the market’s monthly volume
    had declined on a year over year basis. There were 543 months in the test and
    the average month gained a little over ½%. There have been 125 times where volume
    has come in lower than the same month the year before. Results following such
    months were in line with all months as a whole. I also checked to see if it mattered
    whether the month was positive or negative, or whether it closed at the highest
    monthly level in 6 months made any difference. Somewhat surprising to me, I was
    unable to decipher any edge, bullish or bearish, to a year over year decline in
    volume.

  zh: 昨晚我探讨的一个观察点是，成交量不仅在3月份触底后下降，而且从年度角度来看也在下降。7月份的成交量可能低于2008年。由于成交量的长期趋势一直在上升，我决定查看市场月成交量在其他年度同比下降的情况。在测试中，有543个月份，平均每个月份的成交量增长了约半个百分点。有125个月的成交量低于前一年的同一个月。这样的月份之后的结果与所有月份的整体情况相符。我还检查了成交量是否低于前一年同月是否会影响月份的阴阳，或者成交量是否在6个月内最高水平收盘是否有任何区别。让我有些惊讶的是，我无法分辨出成交量年度同比下降的看涨或看跌边缘。
