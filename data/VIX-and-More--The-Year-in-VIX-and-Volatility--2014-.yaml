- en: This is the seventh year in a row I have offered a retrospective look at the
    year in VIX and Volatility, which is my attempt to cram some of the highlights
    of the year in volatility onto one ~~eye chart~~ graphic with a (somewhat) manageable
    number of annotations.

  zh: 这是连续第七年我提供对VIX和波动性一年的回顾，这是我试图将一年中波动性的亮点浓缩在一张~~眼图~~图表上，并带有(相对)容易管理的注释数量。
- en: In aggregate, 2014 was a very quiet year for the VIX, with a mean close of just
    14.19 for the year, which is the lowest the VIX has been since 2006 and third
    lowest since 1995\. On the other hand, as I recently documented, [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    were common last year, with 2014 registering the [third highest number of 20%
    VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2015/01/2014-had-third-highest-number-of-20-vix.html)
    since the beginning of VIX data, in 1990\. In short, the VIX was susceptible to
    large spikes, but these were typically followed by strong [mean-reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    declines. For example, the peak VIX of 31.06 on October 15 was the highest VIX
    reading since 2011, yet just six weeks later the VIX was back in the 11s.

  zh: 总的来说，2014年是VIX非常平静的一年，全年平均收盘价为14.19，这是自2006年以来VIX最低的，也是自1995年以来的第三低。另一方面，如我最近所记录的，去年的VIX激增是常见的，2014年记录了自1990年VIX数据开始以来的[第三高20%的VIX激增](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2015/01/2014-had-third-highest-number-of-20-vix.html)。简而言之，VIX容易产生大的激增，但随后通常会出现强烈的[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)下跌。例如，10月15日VIX达到31.06，这是自2011年以来最高的VIX读数，然而六周后VIX又回到了11多。
- en: When asked in October what they perceived as the biggest threat to stocks, respondents
    to the *VIX and More* fear poll pointed to the end of quantitative easing and
    the removal of the Fed safety net as their top concern, with [Ebola](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ebola)
    narrowly edging out the much more nebulous “market technical factors” for the
    second slot. As best as I am able to determine, it was the panic associated with
    [fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) of an Ebola epidemic
    that took an already elevated VIX and pushed it up into the 30s.

  zh: 当被问及十月份他们认为对股市最大的威胁是什么时，*VIX和更多*恐惧调查的受访者将量化宽松的结束和美联储安全网的移除列为他们最关心的问题，而[埃博拉](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ebola)险胜“市场技术因素”获得第二名。据我所能确定的，是与[对埃博拉疫情的恐惧](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)相关的恐慌使VIX已经上升并推动其达到30多。
- en: At various times during the year, [Ukraine](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine)/[Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia),
    [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil), ISIS/ISIL,
    [Israel](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Israel)/Gaza, [the Fed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC)
    and the European Central Bank all managed to increase anxiety and perceptions
    of risk among investors. Also, the narrow miss in the vote for Scottish independence
    created turmoil in the United Kingdom and across the euro zone, but managed to
    avoid morphing into another nationalist crisis. Early in the year, there was a
    [currency](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies) crisis in [emerging
    markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets) that
    was triggered by (unfounded, in retrospect) concerns about higher interest rates
    in the U.S. Throughout the year there were concerns about valuations and excesses
    momentum trading in the likes of [biotechnology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/biotech),
    social media, internet and solar stocks. To some extent, these concerns peaked
    in April (see [The Correction as Seen in the ETP Landscape](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-correction-as-seen-in-etp-landscape.html)
    for additional details), only to return periodically throughout the balance of
    the year.

    Fed Chair Janet Yellen was leaning toward a more hawkish stance, the inevitable
    march to higher interest rates in the U.S., the weakening of emerging markets
    currencies and the potential fallout from the Fed’s tapering of bond purchases.
    In retrospect, investors were largely worrying about the wrong things.

  zh: 去年这个时候，普遍的担忧集中在美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦是否倾向于更加鹰派的立场，美国利率不可避免地上升，新兴市场货币的贬值以及美联储减缓购债可能带来的潜在后果。回想起来，投资者主要是在担心错误的事情。

    Saudi Arabia and Ukraine back in the spotlight, with the Swiss National Bank and
    European Central Bank dominating news on the central banking front. If the past
    is any guide, the big issue for 2015 has yet to rear its ugly head, whether it
    turns out to be a gray, charcoal or black swan.
