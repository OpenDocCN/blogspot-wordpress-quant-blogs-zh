  zh: 在经济学中谈到经济周期。他正在研究标准宏观经济理论是否将经济的这种间歇性起伏视为真实循环的结果，即由正反馈产生的持续振荡，还是将这些波动视为对系统的外部冲击的结果。正如他所指出的，宏观经济学中的趋势很大程度上是后者：
- en: When things like this [cycles] happen in nature - like the Earth going around
    the Sun, or a ball bouncing on a spring, or water undulating up and down - it
    comes from some sort of *restorative force*. With a restorative force, being up
    high is what makes you more likely to come back down, and being low is what makes
    you more likely to go back up. Just imagine a ball on a spring; when the spring
    is really stretched out, all the force is pulling the ball in the direction opposite
    to the stretch. This causes cycles.

- en: In modern macro models, business "cycles" are nothing like waves. A boom does
    not make a bust more likely, nor vice versa. Modern macro models assume that what
    looks like a "cycle" is actually something called a "trend-stationary stochastic
    process" (like an [AR(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model)).
    This is a system where random disturbances ("shocks") are temporary, because they
    decay over time. After a shock, the system reverts to the mean (i.e., to the "trend").
    This is very different from harmonic motion - a boom need not be followed by a
    bust - but it can end up looking like waves when you graph it...

    pendulum. Give such a system a kick and it will swing for a time but eventually
    the motion will damp away. For a while, high now does portend low in the near
    future, and vice versa. But this pendulum won't start start swinging this way
    on its own, nor will it persist in swinging over long periods of time unless repeatedly
    kicked by some external force.

  zh: 我认为这很有趣，值得进一步讨论。想象一下普通的钟摆。给这样一个系统一个踢，它会摆动一段时间，但最终运动会消散。有一段时间，高处预示着不久的将来会有低处，反之亦然。但是这个钟摆不会自行开始摆动，也不会在没有外部力量反复踢击的情况下长时间保持摆动。
- en: This is in fact a system of just the kind Noah is describing. Such a pendulum
    (taken in the linear regime) is akin to the AR(1) autoregressive process entering
    into macroeconomic models and it acts essentially as a filter on the source of
    shocks. The response of the system to a stream of random shocks can have a harmonic
    component, which can make the output look roughly like cycles as Noah mentioned.
    For an analogy, think of a big brass bell. This is a pendulum in the abstract,
    as it has internal vibratory modes that, once excited, damp way over time. Hang
    this bell in a storm and, as it receives a barrage of shocks, you'll hear a ringing
    that tells you more about the bell than it does the storm.

  zh: 这实际上正是诺亚所描述的系统。这样的摆锤（在线性区域内）类似于进入宏观经济模型的AR(1)自回归过程，它基本上是一个冲击源的滤波器。系统对一系列随机冲击的响应可能具有谐波分量，这可以使输出看起来像诺亚提到的周期。作为一个类比，想想一个很大的黄铜钟。这是一个在抽象意义上的摆锤，因为它有内部振动模式，一旦激发，就会随着时间的推移减弱。在风暴中挂上这个钟，当它受到一连串冲击时，你会听到铃声，这告诉你更多关于钟的信息，而不是风暴。
- en: Still, to get really interesting cycles you need to go beyond the ordinary pendulum.
    You need a system capable of creating oscillatory behavior all on its own. In
    dynamical systems theory, this means a system with a limit cycle in its dynamics,
    which settles down in the absence of persisting perturbation to a cyclic behavior
    rather than to a fixed point. The existence of such a limit cycle generally implies
    that the system will have an unstable fixed point -- a state that seems superficially
    like an equilibrium, but which in fact will always dissolve away into cyclic behavior
    over time. Mathematically, this is the kind of situation one ought to think about
    when considering the possibility that natural instabilities drive oscillations
    in economics. Perhaps the equilibrium of the market is simply unstable, and the
    highs and lows of the business cycle reflect some natural limit cycle?

  zh: 然而，为了获得真正有趣的周期，你需要超越普通的摆锤。你需要一个能够自行产生振荡行为的系统。在动力系统理论中，这意味着一个在其动力学中具有极限循环的系统，在没有持续扰动的情况下，它不会稳定在一个固定点，而是稳定在一个循环行为。这种极限循环的存在通常意味着系统将有一个不稳定的固定点——一个表面上看起来像均衡，但实际上会随着时间的推移总是消散成循环行为的状态。从数学上讲，当考虑自然不稳定性是否驱动经济中的振荡时，这种情况是值得考虑的。或许市场的均衡就是简单的稳定的，而商业周期的起伏反映了一些自然的极限循环？
- en: Noah mentions the work of Steve Keen, who has developed models along such lines.
    As far as I understand, these are generally low-dimensional models with limit
    cycle behavior and I expect they may be very instructive. But Noah also makes
    a good point that the data on the business cycle really doesn't show a clear harmonic
    signal at any one specific frequency. The real world is messier. An alternative
    to low dimensional models written in terms of aggregate economic variables is
    to build agent based models (of much higher dimension) to explore how natural
    human behavior such as trend following might lead to instabilities at least qualitatively
    like those we see.

- en: Minksy conjectures that financial markets begin to build up bubbles as investors
    become increasingly overconfident about markets. They begin to take more aggressive
    positions, and can often start to increase their leverage as financial prices
    rise. Prices eventually reach levels which cannot be sustained either by correct,
    or any reasonable forecast of future income streams on assets. Markets reach a
    point of instability, and the over extended investors must now begin to sell,
    and are forced to quickly deleverage in a fire sale like situation. As prices
    fall market volatility increases, and investors further reduce risky positions.
    The story that Minsky tells seems compelling, but we have no agreed on approach
    for how to model this, or whether all the pieces of the story will actually fit
    together. The model presented in this paper tries to bridge this gap.

  zh: 米斯基猜想，随着投资者对市场的过度自信，金融市场开始积累泡沫。他们开始采取更加激进的立场，在金融价格上涨时，他们通常会开始增加杠杆。最终，价格达到无法由正确或任何合理的未来收入流预测支撑的水平。市场达到一个不稳定点，过度扩张的投资者现在必须开始卖出，并在类似火灾销售的情况下迅速去杠杆。随着价格下跌，市场波动性增加，投资者进一步减少风险敞口。米斯基讲述的故事似乎很有说服力，但我们还没有就如何建模这一点或所有故事要素是否确实能拼凑在一起达成共识。本文提出的模型试图填补这一空白。
- en: 'The model is in crude terms like many I''ve described earlier on this blog.
    The agents are adaptive and try to learn the most profitable ways to behave. They
    are also heterogeneous in their behavior -- some rely more on perceived fundamentals
    to make their investment decisions, while others follow trends. The agents respond
    to what has recently happened in the market, and then the market reality emerges
    out of their collective behavior. That reality, in some of the runs LeBaron explores,
    shows natural, irregular cycles of bubbles and subsequent crashes of the sort
    Minsky envisioned. The figure below, for example, shows data for the stock price,
    weekly returns and trading volume as they fluctuate over a 10 year period of the

    generate dynamics of this kind. But if you read the paper, LeBaron has tried hard

    human learning dynamics and the behavior of different kinds of market players.
    The model also does a good job in reproducing many of the key statistical features
    of financial time series including long range fundamental deviations, volatility
    persistence, and fat tailed return distributions. So it generates Minsky-like
    fluctuations in what is arguably a plausible setting (although I'm sure experts

- en: To my mind, one particularly interesting point to emerge from this model is
    the limited ability of fundamentalist investors to control the unstable behavior

    look inside and examine all manner of details. For example, during these bubble
    phases, which kind of investor controls most of the wealth? As LeBaron notes,

  zh: 在我看来，从这个模型中出现的特别有趣的一点是基本面投资者控制投机者不稳定行为的能力有限。代理模型的一个好处是，可以深入了解并检查各种详细信息。例如，在这些泡沫阶段，哪种投资者控制了大部分财富？正如
    LeBaron 所提到的，
- en: The large amount of wealth in the adaptive strategy relative to the fundamental
    is important. The fundamental traders will be a stabilizing force in a falling
    market. If there is not enough wealth in that strategy, then it will be unable
    to hold back sharp market declines. This is similar to a limits to arbitrage argument.
    In this market without borrowing the fundamental strategy will not have sufficient
    wealth to hold back a wave of self-reinforcing selling coming from the adaptive
    strategies.

- en: Another important point, which LeBaron mentions in the paragraph above, is that
    there's no leverage in this model. People can't borrow to amplify investments
    they feel especially confident of. Leverage of course plays a central role in
    the instability mechanism described by Minsky, but it doesn't seem to be absolutely
    necessary to get this kind of instability. It can come solely from the interaction
    of different agents following distinct strategies.

- en: The dynamics are dominated by somewhat irregular swings around fundamentals,
    that show up as long persistent changes in the price/dividend ratio. Prices tend
    to rise slowly, and then crash fast and dramatically with high volatility and
    high trading volume. During the slow steady price rise, agents using similar volatility
    forecast models begin to lower their assessment of market risk. This drives them
    to be more aggressive in the market, and sets up a crash. All of this is reminiscent
    of the Minksy market instability dynamic, and other more modern approaches to
    financial instability.

    portfolio positions. Much, but not all, of this movement is driven by risk assessments
    made by the traders. Many of them continue to use models with relatively short
    horizons for judging market volatility. These beliefs appear to be evolutionarily
    stable in the market. When short term volatility falls they extend their positions
    into the risky asset, and this eventually destabilizes the market. Portfolio composition
    varying from all cash to all equity yields very different dynamics in terms of
    forced sales in a falling market. As one moves more into cash, a market fall generates
    natural rebalancing and stabilizing purchases of the risky asset in a falling
    market. This disappears as agents move more of their wealth into the risky asset.
    It would reverse if they began to leverage this position with borrowed money.
    Here, a market fall will generate the typical destabilizing fire sale behavior
    shown in many models, and part of the classic Minsky story. Leverage can be added
    to this market in the future, but for now it is important that leverage per se
    is not necessary for market instability, and it is part of a continuum of destabilizing
    dynamics.
