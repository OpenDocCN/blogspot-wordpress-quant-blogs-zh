- en: today they are closing shop, selling themselves for $7MM plus potentially $30MM
    more (depending on fund performance and how much money leaves), to Stark. They
    still had over $1B in assets, so as one analyst said, the $7MM is 'paltry'. I
    used to work there, and as they were kind enough never to sue me I have nothing
    but nice things to say about them. But they highlight an interesting hedge fund
    dilemma.

  zh: 今天他们关闭了店铺，以 $7MM 的价格出售自己，再加上可能的 $30MM（取决于基金的表现以及离开的资金量），给 Stark。他们仍然拥有超过 $1B
    的资产，所以正如一位分析师所说，$7MM 是“微不足道的”。我曾在那里工作过，由于他们很仁慈从未起诉我，所以我只有好话要说。但他们突显了一个有趣的对冲基金困境。
- en: Say a fund is down 35% or so, as many funds were in 2008\. If you expect a volatility
    of 12%, and hope for a Sharpe of 1, it will be 3 years before you make any incentive
    fees again (the 20% of profits). That's because a high water mark means you only
    make the 20% after your investors are back to their high water mark. Now, if you
    own the fund, you are probably wealthy enough to stand 3 years of no cash flow
    from the basic fund. You probably also get a lot of non-cash utility from owning
    your fund. Thus, I can see why you still keep it going if you are an owner-manager.
    In Deephaven's case, they were 51% owned by Knight Capital, meaning, the main
    owners were not much involved in day to day management, and have other core businesses
    to manage, ones they actually control day-to-day. So, if you are down about 3
    years of expected returns, for an outside owner, it's a good time to exit.

  zh: 如果一个基金下跌了大约35%，就像2008年很多基金一样。如果你预计波动率为12%，并且希望夏普比率为1，那么你需要3年时间才能再次获得任何激励费用（即利润的20%）。这是因为高水位意味着在你的投资者回到高水位之后，你才能获得20%的收益。现在，如果你拥有该基金，你可能富裕到可以忍受3年来自基本基金的无现金流。你可能还从拥有你的基金中获得了很多非现金效益。因此，我可以理解如果你是一位业主经理，为什么仍然选择保持它的运作。在
    Deephaven 的情况下，他们被 Knight Capital 持有51%，这意味着主要股东在日常管理中没有太多涉足，并且有其他核心业务要管理，这些业务实际上是他们日常控制的。因此，如果你预期收益下降了大约3年，对于一位外部业主来说，现在是退出的好时机。
- en: I suspect many funds are facing similar cost/benefit calculations. If a fund
    is down 30+%, most of those who don't feel a real stake in the action will have
    a big incentive to shut down, because of these high water marks.

  zh: 我怀疑许多基金都在面临类似的成本/收益计算。如果一个基金下跌了30+%，那些不真正感到利益关系的人大多会有强烈的动机关闭，因为存在这些高水位。
