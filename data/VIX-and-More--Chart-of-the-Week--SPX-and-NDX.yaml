    graphics, I was surprised to see that I have featured a chart of the SPX only
    once in the past five months ([Chart of the Week: Lack of Volume and Breadth Threatens
    Bull Move](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/chart-of-week-lack-of-volume-and.html))
    and decided that this most important of indices needs to take center stage more
    often.'

  zh: 在回顾以往的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)图表时，我惊讶地发现，在过去五个月里，我只展示过一次SPX的图表([本周图表：成交量和广度缺乏威胁牛市行情](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/chart-of-week-lack-of-volume-and.html))，决定这个最重要的指数需要更频繁地成为焦点。
- en: Alas, this week’s chart of the week shows a year of SPX daily bars, with some
    standard moving averages and [Bollinger Bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands),
    as well as a set of Fibonacci retracement lines that have generated considerable
    discussion in the past ([SPX and Fibonacci Resistance at 966](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands).)
    The new twist on this chart is a simple ratio of the NASDAQ-100 ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX))
    to the SPX, which is included as a study above the main graph. The [NDX:SPX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX%3ASPX)
    shows that while the SPX was retreating from its June 12^(th) high, the NDX was
    outperforming the SPX on a relative basis, as has been the case for the past two
    months. Spurred on by a very strong earnings report from Intel ([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC))
    the NDX:SPX ratio is currently at its highest level since early 2001 and the NDX
    is now comfortably above its June high.

  zh: 唉，本周的图表显示了一年的SPX日线柱状图，包括一些标准的移动平均线和[布林带](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)，以及一组过去曾引发大量讨论的斐波那契回撤线([SPX和斐波那契阻力966](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands))。这个图表的新变化是纳指100([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX))对SPX的简单比率，作为主要图表上方的一个研究。([NDX:SPX比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX%3ASPX))显示，尽管SPX从6月12日的高点回撤，但在相对基础上，NDX的表现优于SPX，这种情况在过去两个月一直如此。受到英特尔([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC))非常强劲的财报的推动，NDX:SPX比率目前达到了2001年初以来的最高水平，而NDX现在轻松地超过了6月的高点。
- en: It is worth noting that outside of technology, the only other major sector to
    have topped its June high is health care ([XLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLV))
    with consumer staples ([XLP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLP))
    just 0.03 below that high water mark. With the leadership role of technology should
    be considered a positive sign for bulls, the high relative strength of defensive
    sectors such as health care and consumer staples might be considered a warning
    sign.

  zh: 值得注意的是，除了科技股外，唯一一个超过6月高点的主要板块是医疗保健([XLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLV))，而消费品必需品([XLP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLP))仅比那个最高点低0.03。考虑到科技股的领导地位对多方来说是一个积极的信号，防御性板块如医疗保健和消费品必需品的高相对强度可能被视为一个警告信号。
