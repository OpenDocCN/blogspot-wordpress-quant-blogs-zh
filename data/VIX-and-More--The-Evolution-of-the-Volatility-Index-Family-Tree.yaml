- en: In the beginning, there was the VIX.  Eventually, the reach of the VIX was deemed
    too narrow and the volatility index universe was expanded to include the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN),
    [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN), and a host of other volatility
    indices based on various U.S. equity indices.  First an American phenomenon, volatility
    indices soon began sprouting up overseas, notably in the form of the German [VDAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VDAX),
    but more recently reaching Asian shores with the April launch of the [India VIX](http://in.ibtimes.com/articles/20080416/national-stock-exchange-nse-nifty-volatility-index-india-vix-sebi-stock-market_1.htm).

  zh: 在起初，有VIX。最终，人们认为VIX的影响力过于有限，因此将波动率指数的范围扩展到包括[VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)、[VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)以及在各种美国股指基础上的一系列波动率指数。首先是一个美国现象，波动率指数很快就在海外发展起来，特别以德国的[VDAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VDAX)的形式出现，但最近随着印度[India
    VIX](http://in.ibtimes.com/articles/20080416/national-stock-exchange-nse-nifty-volatility-index-india-vix-sebi-stock-market_1.htm)在四月份的推出，波动率指数已经达到亚洲。

    the time horizon in which they evaluated volatility with the launch of the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV),
    the 93 day version of the VIX.

- en: It remains to be seen whether the VIX branding and labeling will stick to oil,
    gold and the euro.  Five years ago, the [VIX label was transported from the S&P
    100 (OEX) to the S&P 500 (SPX)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html),
    but until the past few months there has been only one VIX.  With the recent arrival
    of the India VIX, Oil VIX, Gold VIX, and Euro VIX, there is ample room for confusion
    about what exactly “VIX” means.  On the other hand, “VIX” is really just shorthand
    for a generic “volatility index.”  If this potential confusion can be overcome,
    the CBOE may have found a way to enhance and extend the most successful product
    and brand they have ever launched – and in the process dramatically change the
    volatility landscape.

  zh: 还有待观察VIX的品牌和标签是否会延伸到石油、黄金和欧元。五年前，[VIX的标签从标普100(OEX)转移到了标普500(SPX)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html)，但直到几个月前，只有一个VIX。随着印度VIX、石油VIX、黄金VIX和欧元VIX的推出，对于“VIX”究竟意味着什么，很容易产生混淆。然而，“VIX”实际上只是泛指“波动率指数”的缩写。如果这种潜在的混淆能够被克服，CBOE可能找到了一种增强并扩展他们有史以来最成功产品和品牌的方法——在这个过程中，彻底改变波动率领域的格局。
