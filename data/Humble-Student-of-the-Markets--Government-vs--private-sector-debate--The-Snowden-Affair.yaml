    have been privatized. Of course, Snowden did not work directly for the government;
    he worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, a private contractor. Booz Allen is a $6 billion

    paid more than $120,000 a year. That’s pretty good pay for someone who just turned
    30 and never graduated high school. Needless to say, Booz Allen was billing the
    taxpayers even more for Snowden’s work since they are in business to make a profit.
    Snowden may have had extraordinary skills that would justify this sort of pay,
    but there is no way for the public to know.

- en: I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either
    his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries
    are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he
    will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious and without
    discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they
    have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred
    only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war
    by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping
    the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing
    to die for you. ***They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not
    make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which
    I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by
    nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and
    although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves,
    yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.*** Thus it was that Charles,
    King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; 1 and he who told
    us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins
    he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes,
    it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.

  zh: 因此，我说，一个君主保卫国家的武器要么是他自己的，要么是雇佣兵、辅助部队，或者是混合的。雇佣兵和辅助部队既无用又危险；如果一个人依靠这些军队来维持他的国家，他将既不稳固也不安全；因为这些人纪律松散、野心勃勃，且不忠诚，在朋友面前勇敢，在敌人面前胆怯；他们既不畏上帝也不忠于人，只要攻击延迟，毁灭就会推迟；因为和平时期你会被他们抢劫，战争时期则被敌人抢劫。事实上，他们之所以留在战场上，除了那一点微薄的薪金外，再也没有其他吸引或理由，而这并不足以让他们愿意为你去死。***他们在你不用打仗时很愿意成为你的士兵，但一旦战争来临，他们要么自行撤离，要么逃离敌人；这一点我很容易证明，因为意大利的毁灭并非由其他原因造成，而是多年依赖雇佣兵，尽管他们以前在自己人中间表现得勇敢无畏，但外国人一来，他们就暴露了本性。***
    正因如此，法国国王查理才能轻易地用粉笔掌握意大利；1 那些告诉我们，我们的罪过是导致这一切的人说的是真话，但那些罪过并非他所想象，而是我刚刚描述的那些。由于这些罪过是君主的，所以遭受惩罚的也是君主。

    or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a
    republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of captain;
    the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn
    out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him
    by the laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes
    and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing
    nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with
    its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed
    with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers
    are completely armed and quite free.

    the valour which in adversity would defend it.*** And it has always been the opinion
    and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame
    or power not founded on its own strength. And one''s own forces are those which
    are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependants; all others are mercenaries
    or auxiliaries. And the way to take ready one''s own forces will be easily found
    if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider

    have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.'
