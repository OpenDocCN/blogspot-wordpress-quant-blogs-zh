- en: It was a closely watched FOMC meeting. The Fed raised rates by a quarter-point,
    which was widely anticipated, and signaled that it would likely raise another
    quarter-point before it's done. It was interpreted as a dovish hike. The Fed also 
    published a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), also known as the "dot plot".
    In the end, the "dot plot" wasn't very relevant for two reasons. It was stale
    by the time it was published, and there was a high degree of uncertainty around
    the projections.

  zh: 这是一个备受关注的FOMC会议。美联储提高了利率四分之一个百分点，这被广泛预期，并暗示在结束之前可能会再提高四分之一个百分点。这被解读为温和的加息。美联储还发布了经济预测摘要（SEP），也称为“点阵图”。最终，“点阵图”因两个原因并不十分相关。首先，它在发布时已经过时；其次，围绕这些预测存在很高的不确定性。
- en: During these times of uncertainty, what matters more is the Fed's reaction function
    to financial crises. To address that issue, I have conducted an event study of
    how the Fed has reacted to shocks and crises in the past in order to estimate
    the Powell Fed's reaction function.

  zh: 在这些不确定的时期，更重要的是美联储对金融危机的反应函数。为了探讨这个问题，我进行了一项事件研究，研究美联储过去如何对冲击和危机作出反应，以估算鲍威尔美联储的反应函数。
