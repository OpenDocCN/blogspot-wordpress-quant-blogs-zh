    left are the top ETF sector performers during the past month; on the right are
    the top ETF sector performers during the past five days.  For the record, these

  zh: 下图显示了两种不同的 ETF 部门绩效排序。左边是过去一个月内表现最好的 ETF 部门；右边是过去五天内表现最好的 ETF 部门。值得一提的是，这些图形是由[ETFScreen.com](http://www.etfscreen.com/s_sectors.php)生成的，并且可以按照列中指定的任何时间范围进行排序。
- en: Not surprisingly, the big winners for the month were the ultrashort ETFs, particularly
    in technology and energy sectors.  On the long side, real estate and finance-related
    ETFs showed well during the month, an indication that these sectors may be attracting
    a fair amount of bottom feeding activity.

  zh: 毫不奇怪，这个月的大赢家是超短期 ETF，尤其是在科技和能源领域。在多头方面，房地产和与金融相关的 ETF 在这个月表现不错，这表明这些行业可能吸引了相当数量的底部捞活动。
- en: Switching to performance data for the last five days, one can clearly see the
    strong buying action in the real estate and financial sectors, with retail and
    basic materials ETFs also supporting the recent bounce.  So far, the bullish action
    following last week’s bottom has been driven largely by sectors sensitive to interest
    rates and cyclical growth.  The technology sector, which had a nice bounce pre-FOMC,
    has been largely absent from the party during the past few days.

  zh: 切换到过去五天的绩效数据，可以清楚地看到房地产和金融行业的强劲买盘行动，零售和基本材料 ETF 也支持了最近的反弹。到目前为止，上周触底后的牛市行情主要受到了对利率和周期性增长敏感的行业的推动。科技行业在
    FOMC 会议前有了不错的反弹，但在过去几天基本上缺席了这一行动。
