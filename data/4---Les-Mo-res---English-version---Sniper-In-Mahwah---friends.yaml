    it’s the area around the radio tower in Houtem purchased by a HFT firm from Chicago

    first chapter of the book); 2/ as I’m discussing with anglophone publishers about
    the English translation of this book (seems a lot of people want to read it),
    I commissioned a translation of these first pages, so that the American/English
    publishers can “preview“ the book. I do not see why I could not share this translation
    with the readers of this blog and my lovely Twitter followers. So, here is an
    English version of the beginning of “4”. Thanks a lot to my translator, [Daniel

    243.5 meters high” that the Ministry wished to get rid of—the session began calmly.
    The auctioneer verified that the participants had duly supplied their 1,000-euro
    registration fees, ensured that they all had in their possession the administrative
    documentation concerning the property—including the cadastral survey, on which

    the course of which the auctioneer was put roundly through his paces. After just
    twenty minutes, the highest bid was already 700,000 euros, which thrilled the
    Ministry of Defence (which had secretly concluded that it would make out handsomely
    on anything over 400,000 euros) but destabilized the auctioneer. He decided to
    raise the bid increment to 10,000 euros in order to accelerate the sale, after
    which the highest bid quickly reached 1 million euros, then 1.1 million euros,
    1.2 million euros, 1.3 million euros, 1.4 million euros… By 2 million, one hour
    later, the increasingly sweaty auctioneer called a recess and took refuge in the
    restroom to compose himself. History gives no record of what went through his
    thoughts as he looked at the bewildered face in the mirror. “On the sellers’ side,
    nobody had any idea what was happening,” recalls a witness, himself all the more
    surprised by the amount of money that, under other circumstances, he could perhaps

    Under gray skies, they traveled by car to Houtem, 9 kilometers from the dunes
    of the North Sea and 400 meters from the Franco-Belgian border, in the region
    of Les Moëres. A fanciful etymology traces the word *Moëres *back to “Morini,”
    the name of the descendants of the ancient Celtic tribes who had lived there in
    palafittes, wooden houses on stilts that rested on stone mounds known as *pols*.

- en: 'In the Neolithic era, Les Moëres was part of the delta of the Aa (a river whose
    source is in France, south of Saint-Omer), an immense gulf ranging from Calais
    to Nieuwpoort. Only a few islets of land emerged, on which the Morini set up their
    palafittes. When Caesar’s troops arrived in Morinia, the region was just a huge
    chain of putrid swamps, far from ideal for a military occupation. Nonetheless,
    according to his *Commentaries on the Gallic Wars*, Caesar had enormous difficulty
    getting the best of the Morini: “*Of all people, the Belgians are the bravest*,”
    he wrote, a formula the inhabitants of this flat country still like to quote to
    this day, even though in reality the word *brave*was meant to highlight the boorishness
    of the local “barbarians.” By dint of lengthy battles, the Romans finally subdued
    the Morini, but did not settle in this inhospitable region. They were more interested
    in the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, farther south, from which they planned to invade
    England. It is also possible that they decided to keep the marshes intact since,
    when they were flooded by the sea (which occurred frequently), they formed a natural
    impregnable barrier, thus protecting the territory from regular incursion by the
    Saxons.'

  zh: 在新石器时代，Les Moëres 是 Aa 三角洲（一条发源于法国圣奥梅尔以南的河流）的一部分，这个巨大的海湾从加来延伸到尼乌波特。只有少数陆地岛屿露出水面，莫里尼人在这些岛屿上建立了他们的水上房屋。当恺撒的军队到达莫里尼亚时，该地区只是一大片恶臭的沼泽，远非理想的军事占领地。然而，根据他的《高卢战记》，恺撒在与莫里尼人的战斗中遇到了巨大的困难：“*在所有民族中，比利时人最勇敢*”，他写道，这个说法至今仍被这片平原地区的居民喜欢引用，尽管实际上“勇敢”这个词意在突出当地“野蛮人”的粗鲁。经过长时间的战斗，罗马人最终征服了莫里尼人，但没有在这个不适宜居住的地区定居。他们更感兴趣的是更南边的滨海布洛涅港，他们计划从那里入侵英格兰。也有可能他们决定保持沼泽的原状，因为当它们被海水淹没（这种情况经常发生）时，它们形成了一道天然的不可逾越的屏障，从而保护了领土免受撒克逊人的定期入侵。
- en: Nonetheless, year over year, with efficient drainage, Les Moëres were sometimes
    able to be cultivated, at least until the fourth century, when the Aa delta was
    entirely submerged following a brutal climate shift. The gulf then transformed
    into an immense sedimentary basin where peat and clay began to appear. When, a
    century later, the Roman Empire crumbled, a few missionaries attempted to Christianize
    Morinia, but without any real success. It would not be until the sixth century
    that the Christians finally occupied the muddy terrain in a sustainable way, beginning
    a slow and complex process of water control.

    Morinia 基督教化，但没有取得真正的成功。直到六世纪，基督徒才终于以可持续的方式占领了这片泥泞的土地，开始了缓慢而复杂的水控制过程。
- en: 'The first people responsible for draining the swamps were probably the monks
    from the abbey of Saint-Augustin-lès-Thérouanne, founded in 544 a few kilometers
    from Saint-Omer. A papal bull confirmed to the monks that any *terra nova*, legally
    defined as a “land that has been subtracted from the impetuosity of the sea’s
    tides and floods, by man,” would automatically belong to the abbey. It is not
    insignificant that the Benedictines, who later colonized the north of France,
    came from the English region of the Fenlands, a swampy territory where the monks
    had tried various techniques for drying up the waters by draining the liquidity.
    Thanks to this expertise, the Aa delta began slowly to dry out, certain rivers
    were canalized, and the Neolithic *pols*turned into *polders*. But the bad weather
    and the floods came regularly to ruin the monks’ labor: sometimes entire regions,

    nova*，法律上定义为“通过人力从海潮和洪水的冲击中减去的土地”，将自动属于修道院。值得注意的是，后来殖民法国北部的本笃会来自英格兰的芬兰地区，这是一个沼泽地区，僧侣们曾尝试过各种排水技术来排干水分。得益于这种专业知识，Aa
    三角洲开始缓慢地干燥，某些河流被运河化，新石器时代的 *pols* 变成了 *polders*。但恶劣的天气和洪水定期破坏僧侣们的劳动：有时整个地区，经过围垦和耕种，一夜之间就发现自己被水淹没了。
- en: 'Despite rapid Christianization, which led to new ways of occupying space,^([1])and
    the construction of several monasteries involved in drying the territory, draining
    such large quantities of water was punishing work – a bottomless pit. For that
    matter, since every *terra nova*, or *agri occupatorii*, became property of the
    monks, some of the region’s inhabitants were forced to continue living in landscapes
    saturated by pestilential water that sometimes caused lethal epidemics of malaria
    or fever. Outside of the zones controlled by the Benedictines, and then by the
    Cistercians, each community did what it could to make the water the neighbors’
    problem, until finally, faced with disease, everyone decided to form artificial
    lowland lakes, far from residential areas, called “Moëres,” from the Dutch *moer*,
    or “marsh.” It was only with the accession of the House of Flanders in the tenth
    century that the anarchic management of the lands’ drainage came to an end. In
    the twelfth century, Philip of Alsace decided to dry the entirety of the coast,
    from Calais to Nieuwpoort, which was then divided into four sections called *wateringues*.
    This titanic construction still did not entirely meet its objectives: floods,
    spring tides, tempests, epidemics, military conflicts, and famines undermined
    the enterprise. Nature was a hostile ground, something to be ceaselessly fought

    not make any noteworthy progress. One of the richest European abbeys of the era,
    [Ten Duinen Abbey](https://www.tenduinen.be/en) (Abbey of the Dunes), founded
    in 1107, Benedictine and then Cistercian, situated a few kilometers to the north
    of the marshes, nonetheless had its hour of glory, financially and intellectually,
    in the thirteenth century. It boasted a vast domain of several thousand hectares,
    all along the coast from Dunkirk to the Netherlands, which saw the construction
    of numerous barns and other outbuildings. But the Cistercians were hardly worried
    about Les Moëres, which nonetheless counted among their possessions at the time.
    They simply built a farm, the Groot Moerhof, on a spit of land that cut into the
    marsh, the highest point in the region, in order to exploit the peat that had
    formed around the swampy lake when the Quaternary forests were submerged by water

  zh: 另一方面，第四个*wateringue*，即现在的Les Moëres，并未取得任何显著进展。当时欧洲最富有的修道院之一，[Ten Duinen Abbey](https://www.tenduinen.be/en)（沙丘修道院），成立于1107年，先是本笃会，后为西多会，位于沼泽以北几公里处，在13世纪在财务和知识上达到了辉煌的顶峰。它拥有从敦刻尔克到荷兰沿海岸线的数千公顷广阔领地，并建造了许多谷仓和其他附属建筑。但西多会对于Les
    Moëres并不太关心，尽管当时它也是他们的财产之一。他们只是在沼泽中伸出的土地上，即该地区最高点，建立了一个农场，名为Groot Moerhof，以便利用第四世纪当第四纪森林被水淹没时在沼泽湖周围形成的泥炭。实际上，这种开采只是使情况变得更糟：提取泥炭需要扩大沼泽，而水变得越来越侵入性，相应地减少了周围的耕种面积。
- en: 'The Abbey enjoyed great prosperity, but the monks left the natives to marinate
    in the stagnant waters of Les Moëres, which, protected from the sea by sand dunes,
    had become an interior lake whose altitude ranged between 2 and 4 meters above
    sea level, and from which the liquidity could not escape. *Ceteris paribus*, the
    Abbey of the Dunes also had to pit itself against nature to survive: in addition
    to the Hundred Years War and assaults from the Calvinists, it was beset by extremely
    frequent floods which gradually took over the occupied lands, diminishing the
    monks’ financial revenues. The Cistercians became scarcer and scarcer, and only
    about twenty of them still occupied the Abbey when the Protestants finally burned
    it down in 1578\. Unable to continue funding the maintenance required to reinforce
    the dikes separating them from the sea, the monks were ultimately overtaken by
    the sands. The few who remained in the community took refuge in one of the monastic
    barns they owned, some kilometers from the silted-up abbey. The end of the Cistercian
    occupation of the grounds around Les Moëres once again aggravated the situation,
    the waters that had been drained by the monks once again flowing into the interior
    lake and not into the sea.'

    Moëres周围土地的占领结束后，情况再次恶化，僧侣们曾经排出的水再次流入内陆湖，而不是流入大海。
- en: 'The polderization of Les Moëres was almost completed some time later, thanks
    to the colossal works of a remarkable painter, architect, engineer, and economist.
    Born in 1550 in Antwerp, [Wenceslas Cobergher](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Cobergher)
    spent the first half of his life in Italy, until Albert and Isabella of Austria,
    who ruled the Southern Netherlands, arranged for his return to Brussels around
    1604\. Named lead engineer by the archdukes, he built several churches and painted
    some canvases in and around Brussels, and also occupied himself with “economics.”
    He was responsible for the first mount of piety in this part of Europe, which
    opened in Brussels in 1618 at the behest of Albert and Isabella, a project he
    defended in a text in verse entitled [*Apologia ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het
    kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock de tegenraeders, van de Berghen
    van*](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    *[Bermherticheyt](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) *(“Apology
    or defense against criticism by the unreasonable enemies and adversaries of the
    Mounts of Piety”). Mounts of piety had been created by Italian Franciscans in
    the second half of the fifteenth century to combat the abusive practices of Lombard
    usurers and Jewish bankers, who lent money at an interest rate of 30 to 40 percent,
    whereas mounts of piety, semi-public institutions, charged only 15 percent. Cobergher
    went on to create more than a dozen mounts of piety in the Netherlands but, like
    the archdukes, had to face opposition from Lombard lenders, who were defended
    by certain theologians, and from the authorities of the city of Brussels, who
    did not look too kindly on the fiscal privileges accorded these new mounts of
    piety and those who worked in them. The “industrious Cobergher” nonetheless received
    considerable support from the Jesuit [Leonardus Lessius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardus_Lessius),
    an eminent but unfairly unrecognized thinker of modern economics,^([2])who, in
    his monumental treatise *De iustitia et iure*, published in 1605, defended these
    public institutions: “*It is necessary to work hard and to do everything we can
    so that such mounts may be erected everywhere in our cities—after the suppression
    of usurers who exhaust the resources of people everywhere by dominating the market*.”
    For Lessius, who was not opposed to the market *per se*, “economic salvation”
    would come by way of, among others, these “mountains of money” which lent at reasonable
    rates and participated in a more equitable distribution of wealth. “*Bono publico
    nati sumus*,” the Jesuit affirmed: we are born for the public good. It was by
    respecting this precept to the letter that Cobergher, some years later, returned
    to his role as engineer to take on the simultaneously technical and economical
    project that was Les Moëres.'

  zh: 后来，由于一位杰出的画家、建筑师、工程师和经济学家所进行的巨大工程，Les Moëres的围垦工作几乎完成。[文策斯劳斯·科贝格](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Cobergher)出生于1550年的安特卫普，他前半生在意大利度过，直到1604年左右，统治南尼德兰的阿尔伯特和伊莎贝拉安排他返回布鲁塞尔。被大公任命为首席工程师后，他在布鲁塞尔及其周边建造了几座教堂并绘制了一些画布，同时也涉足“经济学”领域。他是欧洲这一地区第一座慈善山的负责人，该山于1618年在阿尔伯特和伊莎贝拉的命令下在布鲁塞尔开放，他为此撰写了一篇名为[*Apologia
    ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock
    de tegenraeders, van de Berghen van*](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    *[Bermherticheyt](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) *(“Apology
    or defense against criticism by the unreasonable enemies and adversaries of the
    Mounts of Piety”)的诗文辩护。慈善山是由意大利方济各会士在15世纪下半叶创建的，旨在对抗伦巴第放贷者和犹太银行家的高利贷行为，后者以30%至40%的利率放贷，而慈善山这种半公共机构仅收取15%的利息。科贝格随后在荷兰创建了十多座慈善山，但与大公一样，他不得不面对来自伦巴第放贷者的反对，这些放贷者得到了某些神学家的支持，以及布鲁塞尔市政府的反对，后者对这些新慈善山及其工作人员所享有的财政特权并不太友好。尽管如此，“勤奋的科贝格”还是得到了耶稣会士[莱昂纳多·莱修斯](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardus_Lessius)的大力支持，莱修斯是一位杰出的但未得到公正认可的现代经济学思想家，他在1605年发表的巨著《De
    iustitia et iure》中为这些公共机构辩护：“*我们必须努力工作，尽一切可能在我们城市的每个角落建立这样的慈善山——在压制那些通过控制市场耗尽人们资源的放贷者之后*。”对于莱修斯来说，他并不反对市场本身，“经济救赎”将通过这些“金钱之山”等方式实现，这些机构以合理的利率放贷，并参与更公平的财富分配。“*Bono
    publico nati sumus*，”耶稣会士断言：我们生而为公共利益。正是严格遵守这一原则，几年后，科贝格重新担任工程师的角色，承担起Les Moëres这一同时具有技术和经济性质的项目。
- en: 'It was necessary, at first, to deal with certain legal disputes relating to
    land rights; among other issues, the Cistercians of the Dunes, though silted in,
    invoked an old fishing right over a part of Les Moëres. Others came to claim parcels
    of land, but the archdukes decided unilaterally to appropriate the marsh and declare
    that three fifths of the future *terræ novæ *belonged to them (along with wind,
    water, and fishing rights), reserving the remaining two fifths for Cobergher to
    do with as he pleased. Cobergher the engineer remained faithful to Cobergher the
    economist, proving more charitable than the Cistercians: in order to keep rich
    entrepreneurs from coming to buy the lands once these had become fertile—as they
    promised to be—he ensured that those who worked for him on the drainage project
    would be exempted from taxes throughout the construction and for six months thereafter,
    a fiscal advantage that could potentially be renewed in such a way as to attract
    a population of poor workers who would then occupy these new lands.'

- en: 'Work began in 1619\. Cobergher began by establishing a dike all around the
    lake, which formed an ellipse of 30 square kilometers. All along this dike, he
    had a canal dug 3 meters deep and 20 kilometers long: the Ringsloot, or “ring
    canal.” This Ringsloot then connected with another 10-kilometer canal (“Canal
    des Moëres”) that went as far as Dunkirk, where, at low tide, the water from Les
    Moëres could flow through a lock into the North Sea. After three years of colossal
    labor to complete this first phase, Cobergher turned to the most arduous task:
    extracting the water from the lake to transport it to the Ringsloot. Here he decided
    to use wind against water: he had 23 windmills constructed along the ring canal,
    each equipped with a vertical screw in the shape of a helix (known as an Archimedes’
    screw), so that the power of the wind could lift the water from Les Moëres. “*When
    these machines, which served at the same time to grind wheat, began to work and
    we saw torrents of water flowing into the Ringsloot, and at the same time the
    water level lowered in Les Moëres, and then toward the end of the year the land
    became visible in several places, there was general enthusiasm in the region*,”
    reported the local historian Louis Quarré-Reybourbon in 1892\. The liquidity appeared
    to have been defeated.'

  zh: 工程始于1619年。科贝格首先围绕湖泊建立了一道堤坝，形成了一个30平方公里的椭圆。沿着这道堤坝，他挖掘了一条3米深、20公里长的运河：环沟，或称“环形运河”。这条环沟随后与另一条10公里长的运河（“莫埃尔运河”）相连，一直延伸到敦刻尔克，在那里，低潮时，莫埃尔的水可以通过一个锁流入北海。经过三年艰苦卓绝的努力完成这一阶段后，科贝格转向了最艰巨的任务：从湖泊中抽取水并将其输送到环沟。在这里，他决定利用风力对抗水力：他在环形运河沿线建造了23座风车，每座都配备了一个螺旋形状的垂直螺杆（称为阿基米德螺旋），以便风力能够将莫埃尔的水提升起来。“*当这些同时用于磨小麦的机器开始运转，我们看到水流如注涌入环沟，同时莫埃尔的水位下降，年底时，多处土地显露出来，整个地区都充满了普遍的热情*，”当地历史学家路易·夸雷-雷伯恩在1892年报道说。似乎流动性已被战胜。
- en: 'But new disputes related to grounds and water management arose at the end of
    1622\. Due to the works Cobergher had done, the administrators of the *wateringue*abutting
    Les Moëres (to the south of the lake) could no longer evacuate their water properly.
    They brought the case to court but were quickly dismissed. Shortly thereafter,
    the recent polder was literally attacked by town counselors from the village of
    Veurne (to the north of the lake this time). With the agreement of the Abbey of
    the Dunes, which surely saw this as an opportunity for revenge, they broke a section
    of the dike surrounding the Ringsloot and stole the reeds that Cobergher’s workers
    had used to cover the mills. Between this tense climate and a wind so unfavorable
    that the mills remained immobile for at least six months, Cobergher could not
    finish his great project: stagnant water remained in the shallows of the marsh.
    The engineer, so as not to be “*hastened with wyfe and chylde toward his euident
    ruin*” when “*by industrie and extraordinary labour*” he “*hath surmounted many
    difficulties at great personal expense and risk to his lyfe*,” requested an extension

    “agricultural racks” measuring 220 × 109 meters, sanitized by underground ceramic
    drains and surrounded by secondary channels leading the water from the shallows
    toward the Ringsloot. Rapeseed began growing all around the canals’ 28 kilometers.
    As planned, the engineer took possession of the space reserved for him but quickly
    sold his landed properties: Cobergher, decidedly more hospitable than the Cistercians,
    had also negotiated a certain number of “privileges” for those who bought these
    new lands, particularly a tax exemption and the assurance that no good would be
    consigned to military use. Moreover, since maintenance of the Ringsloot was essential
    to the continued drainage of Les Moëres—the residents’ life and work depended

- en: 'Alas, twelve years after Cobergher’s death, during the Thirty Years War, Dunkirk
    came under siege. The Spanish who took over the city decided to close the locks
    and break down the canal dikes in order to create an aquatic line of defense,
    and Les Moëres was submerged in a night. All habitations and farms were destroyed.
    Only the church survived, its cross-capped bell tower emerging above the water,
    the only visible trace of a collective prosperity now disappeared. It would take
    two more centuries for the drainage of the lake to be complete once more. A more
    recent technology, the steam engine, allowed the windmills to remain active even
    without wind. These water pumps were then named after rivers (Po, Rhine, Danube,
    Tagus, Ganges, Seine…). The primal state of Les Moëres was wild, swampy, and foul.
    Its second state—dry, benevolent, molded over centuries by relentless human effort
    and engineering—attracted many farmers, often from far away. But the water would
    return: during World War I, the French, taking their cue from of the Spanish,
    flooded Les Moëres to prevent German troops from entering their territory through
    Belgium. Emboldened by this experience, the Germans anticipated this maneuver

    buyers of the military property put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence arrived
    near the Franco-Belgian border, the sky was as gray as the land. The terrain of
    the quadrangular fields is made up of clay and muddy gray sands, the ground is
    carved into greenish rectilinear canals, and in winter, when the fields are bare,
    the whole thing melts into a single ash-colored horizon. Perfectly flat, the lands
    extend as far as the eye can see, their flatness reinforced by the altostratus
    clouds from the North Sea. It is a surprising atmosphere, arousing the strange
    feeling of being in a reticular nowhere from which possible horizons somehow radiate,
    one where time seems to stand still. The polder’s uniformity is reinforced by
    the grid of agricultural parcels, by the perfectly straight lines of the hydraulic
    network and of the paths—a model emblematic of that rectitude which some see as
    an icon of modernity, the triumph of human rational thought over the vicissitudes
    of the natural world.

    his great uncle amusing himself by “scaling” the structure at his own risk in
    order to observe the magnificent sunsets over the Belgian coast, this in spite
    of the sign installed at the base of the tower (“ATTENTION. Climbing of this tower
    is prohibited without prior approval of the commander”) and the fact that such
    an ascent is particularly long (over an hour) and dangerous if the climber is
    not harnessed to the “lifeline,” the vertical rope that runs to the peak of the

    2 meters above sea level, stands up thanks to 48 guy-wires, taut cables between
    the tower and the eight anchor points solidly fixed in the middle of the field
    thanks to concrete stilts dug 15 meters deep, indispensable given the liquid nature
    of the ground. Thanks to the tension of the guy-wires, the 243.5 meters of the
    iron monolith—whose circular base, placed on a concrete block, measures only 20
    centimeters in diameter—rise delicately into the sky, an immense vertical line
    prolonging the horizontal lines of the polder, in a silence disturbed only by
    that singular electric vibration caused by the wind whispering against the guy-wires.

    Aeschylus described, as early as 458 B.C., in his tragedy *Agamemnon*, how a communication
    network was used to reveal the name of the victor in the Trojan War to the residents
    of Mycenae, four hundred kilometers as the crow flies from the battlefield, in
    a single night: “*From Ida’s top to Hephaestus, lord of fire, / Sent forth his
    sign; and on, and ever on, / Beacon to beacon sped the courier flame. / From Ida
    to the crag, that Hermes loves, / Of Lemnos; thence unto the steep sublime / Of
    Athos, throne of Zeus, the broad blaze flared. / Thence, raised aloft to shoot
    across the sea, / The moving light, rejoicing in its strength, / Sped from the
    pyre of pine, and urged its way, / In golden glory, like some strange new sun,
    / Onward, and reached Macistus’ watching heights*.”[3]The precision with which
    the locations are described makes it easy to [map](https://oklo.org/2014/11/28/optical-data-transmission/)
    this route, which used a simple flame-generated light signal—the equivalent of
    a bit, in the computing sense—on several hills from which the signal could be
    seen from afar (Mount Ida, Mount Athos, Mount Cithaeron, etc.), allowing the information
    to jump from one high point to the next until it arrived at its final destination.
    The altitude of broadcast relay stations is essential in the setup of high-speed
    aerial networks, and it was for the very same reason that the American army erected
    an elevated communication tower in Les Moëres: it needed to be able to shoot across
    the sea.'

    works. Soldiers posted in Brussels also confirmed that they had encountered problems

- en: This deployment of communication infrastructuretook another direction when,
    on March 7, 1966, on an impulse by General de Gaulle, France announced its intention
    to leave the integrated military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO). The following year, NATO headquarters moved to Brussels; the United States
    transferred over thirty air force, army, and naval bases to Belgium and Germany;
    and the new military command center, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe
    (SHAPE), was established near the Belgian village of Mons, where it remains today.
    The organization, which at the time had its own communication network, Ace High,
    connecting Turkey to Norway by way of Greece, Italy, France, and England, through
    82 relay stations, was also banned from French territory. NATO was thus obligated
    to use a new network, an “*alternative route*,” that circumnavigated the French
    hexagon to the east, passing through Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium, taking
    advantage of the military installations the United States had been establishing
    in the flat country since the Belgian-American agreements of 1963\. This was how
    the tower in Les Moëres, probably completed at the end of 1973, served the American
    Defense Communication System and NATO’s Ace High at the same time, the American
    army having made sure to erect the structure 300 meters from the Franco-Belgian
    border in order to avoid any diplomatic incidents with France should the pole
    catch fire and collapse on the wrong side of the border.

    High的组织，通过82个中继站连接土耳其至挪威，途经希腊、意大利、法国和英国，也被禁止进入法国领土。因此，NATO被迫使用一条新的网络，即“*替代路线*”，该路线绕过法国向东，途经瑞士、德国和比利时，利用美国自1963年比利时-美国协议以来在平坦国家建立的军事设施。这就是位于Les
    Moëres的塔楼如何在1973年底可能完工后，同时服务于美国国防通信系统和NATO的Ace High，美国军队确保将结构建在距离法比边境300米处，以避免如果杆子着火并倒向边境错误一侧可能引发的任何外交事件。
- en: According to a directory entitled *United States Military Forces and Installations
    in Europe*,published in 1989, the tower in Les Moëres was used by DCS and by Ace High
    for troposcatter communications. These connections use ultra-high-frequency waves
    (between 300 MHz and 3 GHz) reflected by the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere
    closest to the Earth), allowing encoded information in the radio signal to travel
    up to 300 kilometers between two relay stations. They were thus used more to connect
    the continents to one another than for solely “terrestrial” networks. According
    to a former U.S. Air Force sergeant who worked on the maintenance of European
    networks, the tropospheric antennas in in Houtem played a crucial role in the
    operation ensuring the repatriation to Europe of soldiers who had been victims
    of a suicide bombing committed in October 1983 by the Islamic Jihad Organization,
    an attack that heavily impacted an American contingent based in Beirut.

  zh: 根据1989年发表的名为 *美国欧洲军事部队和设施* 的目录，莱斯莫尔塔是DCS和Ace High用于对流通信的。这些连接使用被对流层（最接近地球的大气层）反射的超高频波（介于300
    MHz和3 GHz之间），允许无线电信号中的编码信息在两个中继站之间传播长达300公里。因此，它们更多地被用于连接各大洲，而不仅仅是用于“地球”的网络。根据一位曾在欧洲网络维护工作中的美国空军中士的说法，霍特姆的对流层天线在确保在1983年10月由伊斯兰圣战组织实施的自杀爆炸袭击中受害的士兵回到欧洲的行动中起到了关键作用，这次袭击严重影响了驻扎在贝鲁特的美国部队。
- en: 'But *United States Military Forces and Installations in Europe*also mentions
    that the tower was used chiefly for other types of radio connections. It seems
    to have even constituted a veritable case study, as three articles published three
    years after its erection attest: “The use of multiple diversity to minimize the
    effects of ducting on a long microwave path” (1975), “Delay line requirements
    for Houtem-Swingate link” (1976), and “Signal level distributions and fade event
    analyses for a 5 GHz microwave link across the English Channel” (1979). This last
    was published by the American Department of Commerce, itself mandated by the U.S.
    Air Force to run “point-to-point” connection tests with the aid of microwaves.
    Unlike ultra-high frequency waves, microwaves (from 1 to 300 GHz) cannot reach
    the heights of the troposphere. They require two dishes placed in “line of sight”
    formation, or two dishes that absolutely must be visible to one another, since
    the optimal signal propagation between the two relays is horizontal—or more precisely
    geodesic, the Earth being a sphere. As the earth’s curvature hardly allows each
    “hop,” or the distance between two parabolas, to exceed 100 kilometers, the “Hertzian
    beams” are used for “continental,” not global, networks.'

    GHz微波链路的信号水平分布和衰落事件分析”（1979年）。最后一篇文章由美国商务部发表，该部被美国空军授权使用微波进行“点对点”连接测试。与超高频波不同，微波（从1到300
    GHz）无法到达对流层的高度。它们需要两个放置在“视线”形成的碟状天线，或者两个绝对必须彼此可见的碟状天线，因为两个中继之间的最佳信号传播是水平的——或者更准确地说是测地线的，地球是一个球体。由于地球的曲率几乎不允许每个“跳跃”或两个抛物面之间的距离超过100公里，“赫兹波束”用于“洲际”，而不是全球网络。

    a few kilometers from the coast so that the American army could create a point-to-point
    microwave path between Houtem and Swingate, in England, or a hop of 88 kilometers.
    In the 1960s, when this radio hop was created, the village of Swingate, north
    of Dover, was dominated by the famous Three Sisters: three masts only 111 meters
    high, erected by the RAF between 1936 and 1938 to track German fighter planes
    near the English coasts. The Three Sisters were themselves part of the Chain Home,
    a vast set of radars used to monitor the presence of foreign aircraft. One of
    the posts, threatening to crumble, was destroyed in 2010, but two years later,
    at the moment the Belgian government was considering putting the Houtem tower

    of Les Moëres was a question of necessity, for the American army, to have a hop
    that passed over the North Sea. This allowed the DCS network to extend from the
    center of England to Germany, passing through the “Belgian” military properties
    ordained in the 1963 agreements. According to a declassified U.S. Air Force communiqué,
    the Defense Communication System began transitioning in 1979 to the Digital European
    Backbone (DEB), which replaced “*existing analog microwave equipment in Italy,
    Germany, Belgium, Holland, and the United Kingdom with digital microwave and bulk
    encryption equipment. This upgrade involves buildings, or expanding facilities
    and towers*.” Phase III of DEB, mentioned in the communiqué, began in 1988 and
    specifically concerned England and Belgium, particularly the Houtem-Swingate connection,
    in order “*to shape a quad-diversity line of site [sic] digital communications
    system and [provide] connectivity across the English Channel*.”

    of $84,000 based on a comparison of the current annual operations and maintenance
    costs to an annual replacement commercial communications cost. These actions will
    permit more resources to be focused on other U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE) mission
    requirements. The United States no longer requires these sites since the service
    provided by the radio relay system installed in 1996 will be replaced by higher-capacity,
    lower cost commercial communications service*.” Without explicitly saying so,
    the army made it clear that its communications would no longer travel through
    the air but under the ground, thanks to a newer technology than radio waves: fiber
    optics, which offer twice the bandwidth.'

  zh: 十年后，Houtem地产最后一次出现在美国国防部的一份报告中，即《*基地结构报告。1999财年*》，该报告调查了美国在全球范围内的所有军事资产。报告中提到了一个“*Houtem无线电中继站点*”，标记为“*活跃*”，尽管报告暗示该站点已不再是真正的优先事项，甚至可能已不再使用。据估计，考虑到基础设施的过时状态和现行的新标准，真正翻修这座塔楼的预算将达到120万欧元——按面积计算，这是当时美国在比利时建立的物业中最高的修复成本之一。因此，美国放弃了Houtem，直到2006年1月20日的公报中，国防部“*宣布决定停用并将三个微波无线电中继站点归还给比利时：Houtem、Westrozebeke和Flobecq。关闭这些站点将根据当前年度运营和维护成本与年度替代商业通信成本的比较，预计每年节省84,000美元。这些行动将使更多资源能够集中于美国空军欧洲（USAFE）的其他任务需求。由于1996年安装的无线电中继系统提供的服务将被更高容量、更低成本的商业通信服务取代，美国不再需要这些站点*”。虽然没有明确说明，但军方明确表示，其通信将不再通过空中传输，而是通过地下传输，这要归功于比无线电波更新的技术：光纤，其带宽是无线电波的两倍。
- en: 'The American army’s conversion to cables, signaling the end of a long period
    of investment in radio infrastructures in Belgium, should have marked the definitive
    dismantling of the iron monolith—had other Americans, against all expectations,
    not turned up in Houtem in December 2012\. Wenceslas Cobergher had molded the
    new lands of Les Moëres as a shared economic space where the “*public good*,”
    dear to Leonardus Lessius, and a form of “communality” might prevail against those
    who sought to “*dominate the market*.” Some centuries later, a Chicago firm’s
    acquisition of the Houtem tower, which it refused to share with anyone else, revealed
    that occupation had become a private matter for those who sought to master the
    markets by using an immense tower to dominate the landscape. A new kind of battle
    over liquidity would now reign in Les Moëres, one in which the waves sent forth
    by the Chicago company would cross, in the fogs of the North Sea, those of competitors
    no less greedy for speed, and sometimes for liquidity—a new kind of occupation
    of space: aerial, nearly invisible, and silent.'

  zh: 美国军队转向电缆，标志着在比利时对无线基础设施长期投资的结束，本应标志着铁质巨石的最终拆除——如果不是其他美国人出乎意料地在2012年12月出现在Houtem的话。Wenceslas
    Cobergher将Les Moëres的新土地塑造成一个共享的经济空间，在那里，“*公共利益*”，这个Leonardus Lessius所珍视的概念，以及一种“共同体”形式可能会战胜那些试图“*主导市场*”的人。几个世纪后，一家芝加哥公司收购了Houtem塔，并拒绝与任何人共享，这表明占领已成为那些试图通过使用巨大的塔楼来主导景观从而掌握市场的人的私人事务。一种新的关于流动性的战斗现在将在Les
    Moëres中占据主导地位，在这种战斗中，芝加哥公司发出的波将在北海的雾中与同样渴望速度和有时流动性的竞争对手的波相交——这是一种新的空间占领方式：空中、几乎看不见且无声。
