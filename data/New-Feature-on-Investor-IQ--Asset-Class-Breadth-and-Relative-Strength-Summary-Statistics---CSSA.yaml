    is a summary of the breadth and relative strength of various asset class categories.
    This helps provide another layer of information for investors to determine which
    asset classes to focus on and which to avoid. We compile the % of buy signals
    using a matrix of trend and momentum signals as well as the average RS or Relative
    Strength using momentum within the asset class category. The best combination
    is obviously high % of buy signals and high RS. However a high RS with a low%
    of buy signals indicates caution as not all areas are participating as they would
    typically in a healthy market. The RS Spread is the difference between the strongest
    and weakest performer in the category and indicates the degree of opportunity
    for long/short portfolios within the same asset class. A visual of the current
    output can be seen below:'

  zh: 昨天在[Investor IQ](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/05/13/welcome-to-investor-iq/)上引入的新功能之一是对各种资产类别宽度和相对强度的总结。这有助于为投资者提供另一层信息，以确定应关注哪些资产类别以及应避免哪些。我们使用趋势和动量信号矩阵以及资产类别内的动量平均RS或相对强度来编制买入信号的%。最好的组合显然是高买入信号%和高RS。然而，高RS和低买入信号%表明需要谨慎，因为并非所有领域都在像健康市场中所典型地参与。RS差距是该类别中最强和最弱表现者的差异，表明了同一资产类别内长短组合的机会程度。当前输出的视觉图像可以

- en: The asset class categories are listed in order of average RS. We can see that
    domestic equity and style,sector and factor components have the strongest relative
    strength. Traditional equity factors have the highest % buys within the domestic
    equity category. On the international front things are looking challenging – likely
    the result of the trade war. The % buys across countries is only 40% which suggests
    that markets across the globe are broadly struggling right now. This also correlates
    with the weakness in both breadth and relative strength in the Currency category
    which only has 14% buys and has the weakest asset class category average RS of
    only 7\. The strongest asset class categories in terms of breadth are bonds and
    credit which is a trend worth watching. Commodities are the worst performing category
    in terms of breadth with 0% buys and also are relatively weak with an average
    RS of 28\. The RS Spread of Commodities is the highest across asset class categories
    which indicates a good opportunity to go long a strong market such as Oil (USO)
    and short a weak market such as Gas (UNG).

  zh: 资产类别按平均RS排序列出。我们可以看到，国内股票和风格、部门和因子成分具有最强的相对强度。在国内股票类别中，传统股票因子具有最高的买入%。在国际市场上，情况看起来很有挑战性——很可能是贸易战的结果。各国的买入%只有40%，这表明全球市场目前普遍处于困境。这也与货币类别的宽度和相对强度减弱相符，该类别的买入%仅为14%，平均RS也只有最弱的7%。在宽度方面表现最强的资产类别是债券和信贷，这是一个值得关注的趋势。在宽度方面表现最差的类别是商品，买入%为0%，相对强度也只有28%。商品的RS差距是资产类别中最高的，这表明了一个很好的机会，可以长期投资于强市场如石油（USO），同时做空弱市场如天然气（UNG）。

    to overweight/underweight certain asset class categories.
