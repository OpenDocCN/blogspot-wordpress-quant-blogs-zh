- en: When I was on the faculty at Yale I knew people in admissions and it's not clear
    to me that they were the best able to spot potential in 18 year olds. In studies
    of expert performance admissions people are less good at predicting UG[undergrad]
    GPA than a simple algorithm. (The "algorithm" is simply a weighted sum of SAT
    and HS GPA!)

  zh: 当我在耶鲁大学任教时，我认识一些招生办公室的人员，我不清楚他们是否最能够发现18岁年轻人的潜力。在对专家表现的研究中，招生人员不如简单算法能够准确预测本科生的平均学分绩点（UG
    GPA）。（该“算法”只是SAT和高中GPA的加权总和！）
- en: 'When I worked at a bank, I remember we had a bunch of ''underwriters'', and
    their job was to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Coming out
    of grad school, I had no experience with this, and they had this very complex,
    holistic methodology. Later, when I became head of capital allocations and we
    started quantifying their portfolios, I invariably found they could be replicated
    via some pretty simple rules. This got me excited about going to Moody''s to help
    develop their new RiskCalc Private firm model, which today dominates private firm
    underwriting worldwide. Anyway, the simple trick was always the same:'

  zh: 当我在银行工作时，我记得我们有一群“核保员”，他们的工作是评估贷款申请人的信用。从研究生院毕业后，我对此毫无经验，而他们有这种非常复杂、全面的方法论。后来，当我成为资金分配负责人时，我们开始量化他们的投资组合时，我总是发现他们可以通过一些相当简单的规则复制。这让我对去Moody's帮助开发他们的新RiskCalc私人公司模型感到兴奋，这个模型如今在全球范围内主导着私人公司的核保。不管怎样，简单的诀窍总是一样的：

- en: Anyway, with hindsight, I found most of the facade put forth by various departments
    (eg, auto lending, health care lending), was very misleading. Everyone made the
    simple complicated. I think deep down, no one likes to think a computer can do
    their job, and there are many instances where exceptions matter, so a great deal
    is made out of these special cases. Yet the false positives made them great anecdotes,
    but horrible for generalizations. Thus, simple rules dominate their much more
    costly, confusing, and non-quantitative product created by teams of analysts.

  zh: 不管怎样，事后看来，我发现各个部门（例如汽车贷款、医疗贷款）所展示的大部分表面是非常误导人的。每个人都把简单的事情复杂化了。我深知，没有人喜欢认为计算机可以替代他们的工作，而且有很多情况下例外情况很重要，因此这些特殊情况被过分强调。然而，假阳性使它们成为了很好的轶事，但对于概括来说却很糟糕。因此，简单的规则主导着由分析团队创建的成本更高、更混乱和非定量的产品。
- en: These jobs seem rather common. For example, In the nineties many 'traders' I
    knew would simply buy from a customer at the bid, and then sell to another customer
    at the ask, and go home 'making' $10k a day. They would then get a $500k annual
    bonus. A college admissions director probably interviews people all day, and writes
    pages of material supplementing their decisions, but all to trail a simple linear
    rule. I also worked in an econ department, where we created tons of forecasts
    with lots of commentary, all dominated by vector autoregressions. Our asset/liability
    committees would often have a lot of commentary about where various interest rates
    are going, as if these forecasts were any better than what could be lifted from
    forward prices.

  zh: 这些工作似乎相当常见。例如，九十年代，我认识的许多“交易员”只需以买方出价从客户处购买，然后以卖方出价向另一客户卖出，一天就可以“挣”到1万美元，并且提前下班。他们然后会获得50万美元的年度奖金。一个大学招生主任可能整天都在面试人员，并撰写大量材料来辅助他们的决定，但一切都遵循简单的线性规则。我还在一个经济系工作过，在那里我们制作了大量包含大量评论的预测，全部由向量自回归所主导。我们的资产/负债委员会经常对各种利率走向发表很多评论，仿佛这些预测比从远期价格中获取的信息更准确一样。
- en: People in these situations are rather quite pathetic. Many are really good people,
    and would take a big pay cut if they started over, so its not as simple as just
    choosing a new career.
