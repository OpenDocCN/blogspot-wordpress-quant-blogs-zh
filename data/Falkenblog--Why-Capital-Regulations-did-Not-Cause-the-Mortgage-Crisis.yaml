    capital regulations. Mortgages were historically the lowest loss rates of any
    asset class, for the entire dataset anyone looked at. Think of a capital regulation
    as a rule enforced by government. If the rule is binding, this merely makes the
    activity more expensive, as when you amortize the cost of getting caught smoking
    pot (including potential career repercussions, which vary considerably by profession).
    Many rules we think are unnecessary are worked around, as for instance,

  zh: 对次级房贷泡沫的成因有多方面的解释。对我来说最不令人信服的是资本监管。按照历史数据，抵押贷款在所有资产类别中的损失率一直是最低的。想象一下，资本监管就像是政府强制执行的规则。如果规则是约束性的，那只会让这项活动变得更加昂贵，就像你摊销被捉吸食大麻的成本一样（包括潜在的职业后果，根据职业的不同而有很大差异）。我们认为是多余的很多规则都被规避了，比如，

    if done directly (it violates Reg-T for retail brokerage accounts). There are
    shares that allow you to be short, which for 401ks is otherwise illegal, but now

  zh: 有许多股票允许你3倍杠杆，如果这是直接进行（违反零售经纪账户的证券交易法规则），那么这在技术上就是违法的。还有一些股票让你做空，对于401k来说原本是违法的，但现在是合法的。
- en: Now, generally, the government allows you to do many things you can do, but
    shouldn't. Moderation in all things is a good rule, and what prevents most people
    from excess is discipline. People generally don't do things to excess because
    it causes various hangovers, real and metaphorical. So, if the government assigned
    a low capital ratio to mortgages, this did not cause banks to invest in mortgages
    in excess unless they also believed these were of low risk. It was a common mistake.
    So common, in fact, I think it strains credulity to think the regulation was extremely
    important. There were enough investors and companies not bound by US banking regulations
    involved to note this was bigger than them.

  zh: 总的来说，政府允许你做很多可以做但不应该做的事情。万事都应适可而止，能防止大多数人过度的是纪律。人们通常不会过度地做某些事情，因为这会导致各种各样的宿醉，无论是真实的还是比喻性的。因此，如果政府给抵押贷款分配了低资本比率，这并不会导致银行过度投资于抵押贷款，除非他们也相信这些贷款风险较低。这是一个普遍的错误。实际上，我认为认为监管极其重要有点牵强。涉及到的投资者和公司足够多，并且其中许多不受美国银行监管的约束。
