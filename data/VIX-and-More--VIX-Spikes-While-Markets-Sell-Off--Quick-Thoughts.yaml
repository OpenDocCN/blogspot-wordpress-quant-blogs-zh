- en: In thinking what to expect for the magnitude and duration of the VIX move (and
    corresponding moves in the broader markets in the other direction) see an earlier
    post “[What to Expect from a VIX Spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html).”  My
    comments were not specific to last month, but more to the general case and are
    still valid in the current market environment.  Since the VIX had already moved
    up 10% over the course of the past two days, we should know a fair amount about
    the resilience of the current move by early next week.

  zh: 在思考VIX波动的幅度和持续时间以及（在另一个方向上）更广泛市场的相应走势时，请参阅早前的一篇文章“[从VIX暴涨中期待什么](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html)。”我的评论并不特指上个月，而更多地是针对一般情况，并且在当前市场环境下仍然有效。由于VIX在过去两天已上涨了10％，我们应该在下周初就能对当前行情的弹性有所了解。
- en: If the past three months have been “[The Shape of Capitulation in the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html),”
    then seeing the VIX trade above 13 should change the emotional landscape dramatically.

  zh: 如果过去三个月是“[VIX投降的形状](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html)，”那么看到VIX交易超过13将会极大地改变情绪格局。
- en: In other words, even if this VIX spike subsides and the market correction reverses
    itself, the environment will be different going forward.  This is exactly “[What
    My Dog Can Tell Us About Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html).”

  zh: 换句话说，即使这次VIX暴涨消退，市场修正自己的走势，未来的环境也会有所不同。这正是“[我的狗可以告诉我们关于波动性的事情](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/shape-of-capitulation-in-vix.html)。”
- en: Finally, I was not putting much credence in the observation made by quite a
    few commentators that the markets could not continue their strong bull move unless
    the VIX dropped below 10.  I still do not believe this is the case, but the recent
    action may harden the beliefs of those who think that 10 is some kind of a magic
    number in the VIX.

  zh: 最后，我并没有太在意许多评论员所说的市场除非VIX跌破10否则无法继续强劲上涨。我仍然不认为这是正确的，但最近的行动可能会强化那些认为10是VIX某种魔法数字的人的信念。
