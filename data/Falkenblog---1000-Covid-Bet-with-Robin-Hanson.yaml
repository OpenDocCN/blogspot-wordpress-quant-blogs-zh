    which seems simply self-serving, but it makes sense if your vision of a pandemic
    comes from dystopic science-fiction movies. If all health care providers die first,
    everyone else is sure to die next because, without health experts, health experts
    expect society to revert to Medieval life expectancies. Thus the priority was

    the 'standard rate' as defined by 'diagnosis-related groups.' These rates are
    benchmarks that allow insurers to show you how much you are saving with them.
    They are also high rates because they have low collection rates, and hospitals
    are obligated to service an ill person regardless of insurance. Many patients
    leave and are untraceable, so those who pay subsidize those who do not, a hidden
    redistributive tax within our health care. A covid diagnosis generates the standard
