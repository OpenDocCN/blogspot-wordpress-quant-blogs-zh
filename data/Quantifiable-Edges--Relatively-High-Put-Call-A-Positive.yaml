- en: The market finally broke its consolidation on Wednesday. One intermediate-term
    positive I’m seeing right now is the action in the CBOE put/call ratio. Today
    it closed at 1.16\. Over the last 4 days it has averaged 1.12\. High put/call
    ratios are normally associated with market selloffs, yet the market made a 20-day
    high as recently as Monday.

  zh: 市场终于在周三打破了它的盘整。我现在看到的一个中期积极现象是CBOE看跌/看涨比率的表现。今天它收盘于1.16。在过去4天里它平均为1.12。高看跌/看涨比率通常与市场抛售联系在一起，然而市场在最近的一个月高点附近，甚至就在周一。
- en: 'Relatively high levels of put buying are indicative of worry on the part of
    traders, which is why they are more common during selloffs than during upmoves.
    I looked back to check other times when the 4-day put/call ratio was above 1.10
    and the market was within three days of a 20-day high. Looking back to 1995 I
    only found three instances: 8/23/06, 2/23/07, and 5/25/07.'

  zh: 相对较高的看跌购买水平表明交易员们存在担忧，这也是为什么在抛售期间比在上涨期间更常见。我回溯过去，查看其他在4天看跌/看涨比率高于1.10且市场在20天高点三天内的时段。回溯到1995年，我找到了三个这样的实例：2006年8月23日、2007年2月23日和2007年5月25日。
- en: August 23, 2006 was a great buying opportunity both short and long-term. It
    marked a low point and the market rallied for several months following that.

  zh: 2006年8月23日是一个绝佳的买入机会，无论短期还是长期。它标志着一个低点，并且市场在接下来的几个月里从这个低点反弹。
- en: February 23, 2007 was certainly not a buying opportunity. It came just two days
    before the market collapsed over 3.5% on February 27th.

  zh: 2007年2月23日绝对不是一个买入机会。它发生在市场在2月27日下跌了3.5%的前两天。
- en: May 25, 2007 was followed by a 5-day rally and then an extremely choppy month
    of June.

  zh: 2007年5月25日之后出现了5天的反弹，然后是6月份极其波动的一个月。
- en: Not much to learn from these three examples. It should be noted, though that
    the put/call ratio has been significantly higher over the past couple of years
    than it was in the beginning of the decade. To adjust for this I normalized the
    data by using the 100-day moving average.

  zh: 从这三个例子中学不到太多东西。不过应该注意的是，过去几年中看跌/看涨比率比本世纪初要高得多。为了调整这一点，我用100天移动平均值对数据进行了标准化。
- en: I once again looked at any time the S&P 500 had made at least a 20-day high
    in the last 3 days. This time I only required that the four-day average put/call
    ratio was above its 100-day moving average. After eliminating overlap and looking
    out at least 20-days I found 47 instances going back to 1995\. 33 of these led
    to positive returns over the next 20 days and 14 of them led to declines – a 70%
    win rate. The average win was 2.7% and the average loss was 2.5%. The average
    trade was 1.1%. Not overwhelming numbers by any stretch but not bad, especially
    considering the market was already at a 20-day high.

  zh: 我再次查看了标普500在过去3天至少创出20天高点的任何时段。这次我只需要四天平均看跌/看涨比率高于其100天移动平均值。在消除重叠并至少向前看20天后，我发现从1995年至今有47个这样的实例。其中33个在接下来的20天内实现了正回报，14个则导致了下跌——胜率为70%。平均胜率为2.7%，平均亏损为2.5%，平均交易收益为1.1%。无论如何拉伸，这些数字都不是压倒性的，但也不错，尤其是考虑到市场已经处于20天高点。
- en: In all I would consider the relatively high put/call ratios we are currently
    seeing a positive. They may help to provide a “wall of worry” for the market to
    climb.

  zh: 总体而言，我认为目前所看到的相对较高的看跌/看涨比率是积极的。它们可能有助于为市场提供一道“担忧之墙”，让市场得以攀升。
