- en: reported that the bottom-up consensus forward 12-month estimate fell -1.9% last
    week, and -18.3% since downgrades began seven weeks ago. I have been monitoring
    the evolution of forward 12-month EPS for several years, and this level of revision
    is extraordinarily high. In the past, the magnitude of weekly revisions was usually
    about 0.1%, and swings of 0.2% would be considered high. Now, revisions are an
    order of magnitude higher at 1% or more. In addition, estimates have been falling
    while stock prices have been rising.

  zh: 报告显示，自上而下的共识预测未来12个月的预估上周下跌了-1.9%，自七周前开始下调以来下跌了-18.3%。我一直在监控未来12个月每股收益（EPS）的变化，这种修订程度非常高。在过去，每周修订的幅度通常约为0.1%，0.2%的波动就已经被认为是较高的。而现在，修订幅度提高了一个数量级，达到1%或更多。此外，预估收益在下降的同时，股价却在上涨。
- en: Companies gave little in the way of earnings guidance during this earnings season.
    In fact, 47 companies withdrew their 2020 EPS guidance for the full year as management
    as uncertainty rose. However, there is a remedy for investors looking for greater
    clarity on the earnings outlook.

  zh: 在这个财报季，公司几乎没有提供有关收益的指导。实际上，由于管理层的不确定性增加，47家公司撤回了他们对2020年全年的每股收益（EPS）指导。然而，对于那些寻求更明确收益前景的投资者来说，有一个解决办法。
