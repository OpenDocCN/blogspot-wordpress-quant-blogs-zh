- en: . The CBI was devised from a system I use to trade individual (primarily S&P
    100) stocks and sometimes ETFs. I devised the system in 2005 and refer to it as
    my “Catapult” system. The Catapult was designed to take advantage of extreme (often
    capitulative) selling in these securities. The CBI reading is basically a count
    of the open Catapult triggers at any one time among S&P 100 stocks. What I noticed
    early on was that broad triggering of this system was frequently a sign that not
    only were these individual stocks primed for a bounce, but the market as a whole
    was also very likely to bounce. I have written an awful lot on the blog about
    edges that could be found by entering the market when the CBI reached certain
    levels. Traders that would like to examine any of that research more closely are
    always welcome to use

  zh: 。CBI 是我在2005年用来交易个别股票（主要是标普100）和有时ETF的系统。我在2005年设计了这个系统，称其为我的“Catapult”系统。Catapult
    旨在利用这些证券的极端（通常是投降性）卖出。CBI 读数基本上是在标普100股票中同时开放的 Catapult 触发器的计数。我早期注意到的是，这个系统的广泛触发通常是个别股票和整个市场都准备好反弹的迹象。我在博客上写了很多关于当
    CBI 达到某些水平时可以找到的市场边缘。希望仔细检查那项研究的交易员总是可以使用

- en: In February 2008 I began the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter. As part of
    the letter I included signals for my Catapult System. The success of the Catapult
    trades over the years has made it an attractive and somewhat popular feature for
    subscribers. I publish any signals that occur that night in the letter. Then using
    a limit order the next day I track them in the letter as well. When the exit signal
    occurs I also note this. The standard exit for a Catapult is at the open the day
    following the exit trigger. (On occasion I will send intraday updates alerting
    subscribers that the exit will trigger at a certain level and I am going to exit
    the trade at the close rather than waiting for the next day’s open.) While many
    subscribers have profited from the Catapult trades, there has been one common
    complaint.

  zh: 2008年2月，我开始撰写量化边缘订阅者信件。作为信件的一部分，我包括了 Catapult 系统的信号。Catapult 交易多年来取得的成功使它成为订阅者中有吸引力和相当受欢迎的功能。我在信件中发布当晚发生的任何信号。然后，第二天使用限价订单，我在信件中跟踪它们。当退出信号发生时，我也予以记录。Catapult
    的标准退出是在触发退出后的第二天开盘。（偶尔我会在盘中更新，通知订阅者退出将在某个水平触发，并且我将在收盘时退出交易，而不是等待下一天的开盘。）尽管许多订阅者从
    Catapult 交易中获利，但有一个常见的抱怨。
- en: The complaint is that since the Catapult is the one system on the site in which
    I do not reveal the entry and exit criteria it makes the trades uncomfortable
    for some traders. Not knowing when (or exactly how) the exit will come has prohibited
    some subscribers from ever entering these trades. They have instead watched many
    go by and found themselves a bit frustrated that they couldn’t take advantage
    without understanding the exit criteria. So I set about to solve this issue. Recently
    I released to subscribers the “Catapult Exit Designer” for Tradestation. The Catapult
    Exit Designer is open code that triggers entries as listed in the Subscriber letter
    over the last 4 years (over 250 trades) and allows the users to test their own
    exit criteria. It generates files for them with results of all trades. And for
    those subscribers that don’t use Tradestation, I show all the code and explain
    all the logic behind it so that you may easily transfer it to you preferred platform.
    In addition I provide sample exit strategies that would have produced results
    very similar to the actual Catapult exits.

  zh: 抱怨的焦点在于，由于Catapult是我在网站上唯一不透露进入和退出标准的系统，这让一些交易员在进行交易时感到不舒服。不知道退出将在何时（或确切如何）发生，阻止了一些订阅者参与这些交易。他们反而看着很多机会擦肩而过，并发现自己因为没有理解退出标准而感到有些沮丧。所以，我着手解决这个问题。最近，我向订阅者发布了适用于Tradestation的“Catapult
    Exit Designer”。这个Catapult Exit Designer是一个开源代码，它触发了过去4年中（超过250笔交易）订阅者信件中列出的入场点，并允许用户测试他们自己的退出标准。它会为他们生成包含所有交易结果的文件。对于那些不使用Tradestation的订阅者，我展示了所有的代码并解释了背后的所有逻辑，以便您能够轻松地将其转移到您偏好的平台上。此外，我还提供了与实际Catapult退出结果非常相似的示例退出策略。
- en: The Catpult trades have done very well over the years. Of those that received
    fills and were tracked in the letter over 72% were winners, the average trade
    made 3.35% and the profit factor has been an impressive 3.32\. What has most attracted
    me to this strategy is not just the fact that it has made money, but WHEN. Catapults
    generally trigger when the market gets scary. They happen when other systems and
    techniques I employ have sometimes struggled. So they have not only made me money,
    but they've done so when other methods were losing.  This was greatly useful in
    helping me to limit or avoid drawdowns. The timing of the trades can be seen in
    the chart below. The top of the chart shows the S&P 500\. The indicator on the
    bottom is the CBI. One way I track catapult trades is by "clusters". A cluster
    of trades begins when the CBI moves above zero and it ends when the CBI returns
    back to zero. Historically I found over 90% of clusters would have been net winners
    had you taken all the trades in the cluster with equal size. (The last cluster
    that had a net loss was about 2 ½ years ago.) Above each cluster in the chart
    is a number. That number shows the net additive gains that would've been generated
    by that particular cluster.

  zh: Catapult交易多年来表现非常好。在那些获得成交并在我信件中跟踪的交易中，超过72%是盈利的，平均交易收益为3.35%，盈利因子令人印象深刻，达到了3.32。吸引我这个策略的不仅仅是它赚钱的事实，还有它赚钱的时间。Catapult通常在市场变得恐怖时触发。它们发生在我使用的其他系统和技巧有时会遭遇困难的时候。因此，它们不仅让我赚钱，而且是在其他方法亏损时赚的。这对我限制或避免回撤非常有帮助。交易的时机可以在下面的图表中看到。图表顶部显示的是标普500。图表底部的是CBI指标。我跟踪Catapult交易的一种方式是通过“交易群”。当CBI升至零上时，交易群开始，当CBI返回零时，交易群结束。历史上，我发现超过90%的交易群如果你以相等的大小接受交易群中的所有交易，那么这些交易群将是净盈利的。（最后一个出现净亏损的交易群大约是2
    ½年前。）图表中每个交易群的上面都有一个数字。这个数字显示了该交易群将产生的净累加收益。

    an example to clarify, the latest cluster closed out in October. That cluster
    saw 8 Catapults get triggered and filled. They all were winners (not typical).
    The % gain for each was the following: 2.8%, 6.2%, 5.0%, 11.1%, 5.2%, 8.9%, 0.2%,
    and 0.3%. Add those numbers up and you get the 39.7% shown above the October cluster.
    That is what I mean by “additive gain”. It is NOT a portfolio return.)*'
