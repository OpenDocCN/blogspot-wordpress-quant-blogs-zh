- en: Now that stock prices have recovered from their March lows to all-time highs,
    it's time to admit that I was wrong about my excess cautiousness. I present a
    new framework for analyzing the stock market. While the new framework is useful
    for explaining why the major US market indices have reached fresh highs, it does
    not necessarily have bullish implications.

  zh: 现在股市已经从3月份的低点恢复到创纪录的高点，是时候承认我之前的过度谨慎是错误的了。我提出了一个新的分析股市的框架。虽然这个新框架有助于解释为何美国主要市场指数达到了新的高点，但它未必具有看涨的含义。
- en: My previous excessive cautiousness was based on two factors, valuation and a
    weak economic outlook. The market is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 22, which
    is extremely high by historical standards. Moreover, it was difficult to believe
    that the economy and stock prices could recover that strongly in the face of the
    second worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

  zh: 我此前的过度谨慎基于两个因素：估值和疲弱的经济前景。市场当前的市盈率为22，按照历史标准来看，这是非常高的。此外，很难相信，在面对自大萧条以来第二严重的经济衰退时，经济和股市能够如此强劲地复苏。
- en: While there has been much discussion over the letter shapes of the recovery,
    whether it's a V, W, L or some other shape. The reality is a K-shaped bifurcated
    rebound. This bifurcation is occurring in two separate and distinct dimensions,
    the stock market and the path of economic growth.

    investors should view the market's future outlook.
