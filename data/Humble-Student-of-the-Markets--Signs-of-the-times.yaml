  zh: BBC 新闻 - 英国的穆斯林自杀炸弹袭击者计划从周一开始进行为期三天的罢工，原因是对于他们在来世中所享有的处女数量存在争议。与基地组织的紧急会谈目前尚未达成一致。
- en: The unrest began last Tuesday when Al Qaeda announced that the number of virgins
    a suicide bomber would receive after his death would be cut by 25% this February
    from 72 to 60\. A company spokesman said increases in recent years in the number
    of suicide bombings have resulted in a shortage of virgins in the afterlife.

  zh: 不安情绪始于上周二，当基地组织宣布今年 2 月自杀炸弹袭击者死后所获得的处女数量将从 72 个减少 25%，至 60 个。一位公司发言人表示，近年来自杀式爆炸袭击数量的增加导致了来世处女的短缺。
- en: The suicide bombers' union, the British Organization of Occupational Martyrs
    ( or B.O.O.M. ) responded with a statement saying the move was unacceptable to
    its members and called for strike vote. General Secretary Abdullah Amir told the
    press, "Our members are literally working themselves to death in the cause of
    Jihad. We don't ask for much in return, but to be treated like this is like a
    kick in the teeth".

  zh: 英国职业殉道者组织（简称 B.O.O.M.）的自杀炸弹袭击者工会对此做出回应，称这一举措不可接受，并呼吁进行罢工投票。总书记阿卜杜拉·阿米尔告诉媒体：“我们的成员为了圣战而工作，甚至拼命工作。我们不求太多回报，但对待我们如此实在是一种打击。”
- en: Speaking from his shed in Tipton in the West Midlands , Al Qaeda chief executive
    Osama bin Laden explained, "I sympathize with our workers' concerns, but Al Qaeda
    is simply not in a position to meet their demands. They are simply not accepting
    the realities of modern-day Jihad in a competitive marketplace. Thanks to Western
    depravity, there is now a chronic shortage of virgins in the afterlife. It's a
    straight choice between reducing expenditures or laying people off. I don't like
    cutting benefits, but I'd hate to have to tell 3,000 of my staff that they won't
    be able to blow themselves up."

  zh: 从位于西米德兰兹郡提普顿的小屋讲话，基地组织首席执行官奥萨马·本·拉登解释说：“我理解我们工人的关切，但基地组织根本无法满足他们的要求。他们根本没有接受现代圣战在竞争市场中的现实。由于西方的堕落，来世的处女现在已经短缺。要么削减支出，要么裁员。我不喜欢削减福利，但我不想告诉我的
    3000 名员工他们不能自杀。”
