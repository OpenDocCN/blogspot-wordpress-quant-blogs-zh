- en: I discussed the other day that there has never been a Follow Through Day (FTD)
    that occurred AFTER a new 50-day high. There has also never been a FTD that occurred
    in conjunction with a new 50-day high. These things changed on Tuesday since the
    move up was also accompanied by an increase in volume. But there have been some
    FTDs that occurred in conjunction with 20-day highs. Below is a new study that
    shows how they fared.

  zh: 我前几天讨论过，从未有过在创新50天新高之后出现的跟进日（FTD）。同样，也没有在新高50天时出现过FTD。这些情况在周二发生了变化，因为股价的上涨也伴随着成交量的增加。但是有些FTD是和20天新高一起出现的。下面是一份新的研究，展示了它们的表现如何。
- en: Results here are impressive over both the short and intermediate-term. To get
    a better feel for the short-term returns I have listed the instances below.

  zh: 这里的结果在短期和中期都非常令人印象深刻。为了更好地了解短期回报，我列出了下面的案例。
- en: The run-up to drawdown ratio here is quite impressive. I’ll also note that 7
    of the 10 instances went on to have “successful” rallies. (“Success” means it
    either hit a new 200-day high or at least rose 2x as much as it had already risen
    off the bottom.) The 3 instances whose rallies did not succeed (circled in red)
    all saw run-ups of at least 2% before they eventually rolled over and made new
    lows.

  zh: 这里的上涨与回调比率非常令人印象深刻。我还注意到，10个案例中有7个后续出现了“成功”的反弹。（“成功”意味着它要么触及新的200天新高，要么至少从底部上涨了两倍。）那些反弹没有成功的3个案例（用红色圈出）在最终转跌并创出新低之前，都至少经历了2%的上涨。
