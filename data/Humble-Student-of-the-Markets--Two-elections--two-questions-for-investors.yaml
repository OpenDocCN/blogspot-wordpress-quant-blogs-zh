    trade has certainly worked out well. Now that Emmanuel Macron is destined to be
    the President of France, and Angela Merkel is the front runner to win another
    term as German Chancellor, challenges lie ahead for French-German cooperation
    in the eurozone. Macron has voiced his objective of greater European integration
    as part of his electoral platform, the question is, "How much integration is Germany
    willing to accept?"

    markets for future gains, as valuations are far more compelling overseas. Not
