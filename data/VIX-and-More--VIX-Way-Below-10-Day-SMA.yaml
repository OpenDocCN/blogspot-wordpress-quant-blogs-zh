    a study up this morning with the title [VXO Suggesting A Pullback Is Likely](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/vxo-suggesting-pullback-is-likely.html).
    In his previous [Is A Low VIX A Short Trigger?](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/is-low-vix-short-trigger.html)
    Rob concluded, contrary to popular wisdom and quite correctly:'

  zh: 罗布·汉纳在[可量化边缘](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)今天上午发布了一篇标题为[VXO Suggesting
    A Pullback Is Likely](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/vxo-suggesting-pullback-is-likely.html)的研究。在他之前的一篇[Is
    A Low VIX A Short Trigger?](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/is-low-vix-short-trigger.html)中，罗布得出了与普遍看法相反，但完全正确的结论：
- en: '*“Owning the S&P 500 when the VIX was more than 10% below its 10-day moving
    average was significantly more profitable on average than owning it when it wasn’t.”*'

  zh: '*“当VIX低于其10日移动平均线的10%以上时，持有标普500指数平均而言要明显比它不低时更有利可图。”*'
- en: Quoting Rob again, the important distinction to make is that “when the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)
    becomes *extremely* stretched, as it is now, then that changes,” with an extremely
    low VXO “very suggestive of short-term bearish implications.” [Emphasis in the
    original]

  zh: 引用罗布的话，需要明确区分的是，“当[VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)变得*极其*拉伸时，就像现在一样，那就不一样了”，一个极低的VXO“非常暗示着短期的熊市含义。”[原文强调]
- en: My initial thought upon reading this is to recall an important VIX heuristic
    that VIX trades have a higher expectancy when the VIX is extended to the upside
    than to the downside. My second thought was that the reason the VIX (or VXO) typically
    gets extremely extended to the downside – at least relative to a 10 day moving
    average – is that volatility is usually reversing a large upward spike.

  zh: 我最初读到这个的想法是想起了一个重要的VIX启发法则，即当VIX向上延伸时，VIX交易的期望值较VIX向下延伸要高。我的第二个想法是，VIX（或VXO）通常会极度向下延伸的原因是，波动性通常会逆转一个大的向上波峰，至少相对于10日移动平均线而言。
- en: My research shows that since 1990, the 30 instances in which the VIX was lowest
    relative to its 10 day moving average (at least 18% below it) were good times
    to be long the market, on average. In the one to two week time frame following
    the relative low readings in the VIX, there was small advantage to being in the
    markets; after two weeks or so, the advantage for longs becomes more pronounced.

  zh: 我的研究表明，自1990年以来，当VIX相对于其10日移动平均线最低（至少低于18%）的30个实例中，平均而言，长期持有市场是一个好时机。在VIX相对低位读数之后的一两周内，持有市场有一定的优势；两周左右后，多头的优势变得更加显著。
- en: The bottom line is that while the VIX and VXO are well below their 10 day moving
    averages (yesterday was a record in that regard for the VIX), just last week they
    were extremely extended above their 10 day moving averages. This week’s extreme
    readings are as much a residual effect of the extreme readings in the opposite
    direction as anything else. For now the VIX looks to be in a range that is consistent
    with macroeconomic conditions, futures prices, and recent volatility. For those
    that follow the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV),
    it is currently at 1.03, also suggesting that volatility readings are in a ‘normal’
    range given current circumstances.

  zh: 底线是，虽然VIX和VXO远低于它们的10日移动平均线（昨天对于VIX来说是创纪录的），但就在上周它们还极度超出了它们的10日移动平均线。本周的极端读数与相反方向的极端读数一样多。目前，VIX看起来处于与宏观经济状况、期货价格和最近的波动性一致的范围内。对于那些关注[VIX:VXV比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)的人来说，它目前为1.03，这也表明根据当前情况，波动性读数处于‘正常’范围内。
