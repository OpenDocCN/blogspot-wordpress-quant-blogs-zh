- en: SPY has now gone 11 days without closing below its 5ma, and it closed Tuesday
    at another new high. The study below is one I’ve shown a few times over the years,
    most recently in October.  It looks at other instances in which SPY has traded
    above the 5ma for at least 2 weeks and is now closing at a 10-day high. All results
    are updated.

  zh: SPY目前已经连续11天收盘价未低于其5日均线，并在周二收盘时再创历史新高。下面研究的案例是我在过去几年中展示过几次的内容，最近一次是在10月。它研究了SPY至少交易于5日均线之上两周以上，并现在收盘于10日新高的情况。所有结果都已更新。
- en: In the past this setup has commonly been followed by a short-term pullback.
    The downside edge doesn't last long, though. It seems to pretty much play itself
    out over the first 2 days.  It is not an overwhelming edge, but it is still worth
    noting that SPY has been short-term extended for a while and the normal course
    of action at this point is a little pullback.
