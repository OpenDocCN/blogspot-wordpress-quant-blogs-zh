    quite been able to put my finger on the reason - until I looked at the market
    relative charts to see where the leadership has been coming from.

- en: The downdraft that ended in early July was based on a double-dip recession scare.
    If Mr. Market truly believed that the recovery was real, then we should see leadership
    from sectors such as Consumer Discretionary stocks. The chart below shows the
    relative performance of the Consumer Discretionaries (XLY) against the market.
    The sector has been fairly flat against the market since early July, indicating
    that market leadership isn't coming from expectations of a revived consumer.

  zh: 七月初结束的市场下滑是基于双底衰退的恐慌。如果Market先生真的相信复苏是真实的，那么我们应该从消费类股票等行业看到领导力。下面的图表显示了消费类股票（XLY）相对市场的表现。自七月初以来，该行业对市场的相对表现相当平坦，表明市场领导力并不是来自复苏的预期消费者。
- en: What about the Financials? This is a sector that has been badly beaten up since
    the Lehman Crisis and was in need of rescue. Did the Financials lead us up in
    this rally? A glance at the chart below says "no". In fact, Financials remain
    weak and in a relative downtrend versus the overall market.

- en: Under more "normal" circumstances, a market rally would be predicated on a reviving
    consumer or a recovery in the financial sector. Instead, we have a rally led by
    hard assets and capital goods. Digging deeper, this rally tracks the rally in
    the Shanghai Composite, which bottomed in early July and is showing some signs
    of life.

  zh: 在更“正常”的情况下，市场反弹会建立在复苏的消费者或金融部门的基础上。但我们的反弹是由实物资产和资本产品带动的。更深入地挖掘，这次反弹与上证综指的反弹同步，该指数自七月初触底后显示出一些生机。

    weaken and so does the much watched ECRI WLI. While a soft landing in China may
    be a relief to investors, a scenario like that is highly unbalanced and does not
    provide the basis for sustainable global growth.

  zh: 与此同时，诸如ISM制造业指数等指标继续走弱，ECRI WLI也是如此。尽管中国的软着陆可能会让投资者松口气，但这样的情景非常不平衡，并且不为可持续的全球增长提供基础。
