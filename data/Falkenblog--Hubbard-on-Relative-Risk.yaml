- en: The key problem was not something really complicated in the copulas or a misplaced
    confidence on correlations, it was the assumption that housing prices, nationally,
    would not fall in nominal value, significantly. This outcome basically was assigned
    a zero probability, why the correlation assumption was allowed to stand. So, it
    wasn't really that subtle, but it was pervasive, and as we all now know, terribly

    admit that all he did was compare Countrywide to other mortgage originators, so
    if fraud or misrepresentation was pervasive it wouldn't show up in his benchmark
    comparison of Countrywide performance relative to its peers.  Hubbard tries to
    have it both ways, saying at various times he didn't analyze underwriting, that
    he had no knowledge of what other lenders were doing, but also that Countrywide
    wasn't doing anything wrong

    of thousands of dollars by many large corporations highlights that they are all
    paying for his brand name, because his knowledge of mortgage risk is pretty meager.
    The problem, however, is that everyone who really understands this market is clearly

    a Sharpe ratio, not an Information Ratio, but most people don't. I think it highlights
    that there's an easy way to beat the benchmark, avoiding the crowd any sticking
    with boring investments, but the key is you need sufficient reputation or capital

  zh: 相对风险意味着普遍的基准制度和跟踪偏差的重要性。当每个人都像互联网泡沫那样疯狂时，它会导致日晕均衡。现在，很容易说你不应该制定基准，你应该追求夏普比率，而不是信息比率，但大多数人都不那么做。我认为这突显了打败基准的简单方法，避免跟随大众并坚持无聊的投资，但关键是你需要足够的声誉或资本才能做到这一点而不失去工作，所以即使你想做这件事也不容易。
