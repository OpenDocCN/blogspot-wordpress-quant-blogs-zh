- en: In the past, I have been accused of dreaming up strange and unusual charts just
    for the fun of it.  I will gladly enter a guilty plea on that one. In fact, I
    enjoy cajoling the Department of Strange and Unusual Charts to come up with something
    that readers have never encountered before.

  zh: 在过去，有人指责我纯粹为了好玩而构想出奇怪而不寻常的图表。我愿意对此承认有罪。事实上，我喜欢引诱“奇怪而不寻常图表部门”想出一些读者从未遇到过的东西。
- en: If the chart below looks a little out of the ordinary, chalk it up to that personality
    disorder I have already confessed to.  Before trying to interpret whether the
    chart has any possible validity, it is important to take a step back.  Consider
    that each chart contains at least one hypothesis about a relationship between
    various data points and/or data sets.  At first glance that hypothesis might seem
    outrageous or merely coincidental.  The point of the strange and unusual charts
    is that it is more important to drag those hypotheses out into the open and give
    readers an opportunity to pause and reflect on them than it is to present each
    hypothesis as unassailable .

  zh: 如果下面的图表看起来有点不寻常，请归咎于我已经承认过的那种人格障碍。在试图解释图表是否具有任何可能的有效性之前，重要的是退一步。考虑到每个图表至少包含一个关于各种数据点和/或数据集之间关系的假设。乍一看，这个假设可能看起来荒谬或仅仅是巧合。奇怪而不寻常的图表的要点在于，把这些假设公之于众，并给读者一个机会来停下来思考它们，比把每个假设呈现为不可动摇更为重要。
- en: In the long run, it is those strange and unusual relationships that no one else
    sees, but which persist over time, that provide a meaningful trading edge.  So
    keep an open mind and keep looking.

- en: Turning to the ratio of the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)
    to the [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX), recall that the
    VXO is the ‘[original VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html)’
    and reflects the volatility associated with the large cap S&P 100 index (OEX).  The
    RVX, on the other hand, is the volatility index for the Russell 2000 small cap
    index (RUT).  Small caps have been outperforming large caps lately, so it is not
    surprising to see recent volatility trending higher with the large caps.  What
    did surprise me, however, was to see that a spike in the VXO relative to the RVX
    has been an excellent indicator of market bottoms over the past two years.  If
    we extrapolate from the past, the current levels of the VXO versus the RVX also
    suggest a likely intermediate market bottom, at least in the SPX, which is represented
    by a gray area chart in the graph.  Unassailable?  No.  Worth watching going forward?  Absolutely.

  zh: 转向[VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)与[RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX)的比率，回想一下VXO是‘[原始VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html)’，反映了与大盘S&P
    100指数（OEX）相关的波动性。另一方面，RVX是Russell 2000小盘指数（RUT）的波动率指数。最近，小盘股表现优于大盘股，因此看到大盘股的近期波动性趋于上升并不奇怪。然而，让我感到惊讶的是，过去两年中，VXO相对于RVX的激增已成为市场底部的良好指标。如果我们从过去推断，当前VXO与RVX的水平也暗示着可能的中期市场底部，至少在SPX中是如此，图表中以灰色区域表示。不可动摇？不是。未来值得关注吗？绝对值得。
