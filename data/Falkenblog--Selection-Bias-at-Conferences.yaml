    Merril CEO), Richard Fuld (Lehman ex-CEO), Martin Sullivan (ex AIG CEO), Marcel
    Ospel (ex UBS Chairman), Lloyd Blankfein (Goldman CEO). Now, these people used
    to go, and used to be listened to. I would think their stock of knowledge is now
    much greater after adversity than prior, and they have a much more interesting
    tale to tell. But many think these people have merely been exposed as having been
    lucky fools who seemed like geniuses because of the bull markets they presided
    over.'

  zh: 在达沃斯，有几位高调的金融高管缺席：约翰·塞恩（前美林首席执行官），理查德·富尔德（雷曼前首席执行官），马丁·沙利文（前美国国际集团首席执行官），马塞尔·奥斯佩尔（前瑞士联合银行董事长），劳埃德·布兰克费恩（高盛首席执行官）。现在，这些人过去常去，并且曾备受关注。我认为，经历逆境后，他们的知识储备现在比之前要丰富得多，而且他们有一个更有趣的故事可以讲述。但很多人认为，这些人只是因为所主持的牛市而被公认为幸运的傻瓜，看上去像天才。
- en: People want to hear from successful people at conferences. They hope to either
    get a job with him or his successful acolytes, or learn about how to be successful
    like them. But a successful person is probably not going to be totally forthright
    about their edge, even if they know it (after Bob Rubin stated that their subprime
    exposure was a detail outside his scope, clearly many titular leaders are merely
    figureheads). Failure, in contrast, leads to more particularized soul searching.

  zh: 人们希望在会议上听取成功人士的讲话。他们希望要么能从他那里或他那些成功的追随者那里得到工作，要么学习如何像他们一样成功。但成功的人可能不会完全坦诚地介绍他们的优势，即使他们知道它（比如鲍勃·鲁宾说他们的次级房贷风险只是他们注意范围之外的一个细节，很明显很多有头衔的领导都只是名义上的领导）。相比之下，失败更导致更加具体化的心灵探索。
- en: It takes a lot of personal confidence to admit to errors, and very few are willing
    to admit mistakes that are supposedly right in their wheelhouse, right in their
    area of expertise. But in fact these are the errors that are most instructive,
    because the errors of a dilletante are not very generalizable, but when John Merriweather

  zh: 承认错误需要很多个人自信，而很少有人愿意承认那些据说是他们能力范围之内的错误。但事实上，这些错误才是最有教益的，因为一个业余爱好者的错误并不具有很强的一般性，但约翰·梅里韦瑟在1998年搞砸了长期资本管理公司，然后...

- en: in 2008, I want to hear what his diagnosis is. What was he thinking? What went
    wrong, in his opinion? He is not stupid (hate the sin, love the sinner). Errors
    by experts in their own domain are very, very interesting, much more so than listening
    to someone who didn't fail last year. After all, they could merely have been timid,
    or clueless. Putting all your money in cash, or having a monkey randomly going
    long or short the S&P every day would have outperformed the S&P last year. Noise
    would have beat most investments last year, so although it is clearly better to
    have made 0% last year, I'm not impressed. There's a hedge fund that was down
    only a couple of percent last year, and thinks people will flock to them for their

  zh: 2008年，我想听听他的诊断意见。他当时在想什么？在他看来，发生了什么错误？他不笨（憎恶罪恶，爱护罪人）。领域专家的错误非常非常有趣，比听取去年未曾失败的人更有趣。毕竟，他们只是可能过于胆小或者无知。把所有的钱放在现金里，或者让一只猴子每天随机做多或做空标准普尔500指数都会跑赢标准普尔500指数。噪音去年大多会胜过绝大多数投资，所以尽管明显地去年赚得0%更好，但我并不感到印象深刻。有一个对冲基金去年只跌了几个百分点，认为人们会涌向他们来购买他们的

- en: Anyway, it would be a good thing if people who made mistakes were treated with
    good faith, that their errors were reasonable, and so to that end, listening to
    their explanation about what they did, and why it didn't work, is truly enlightening.
    Much more so than Maria Bartiromo talking to George Soros about his silly reflexivity
    theory.

  zh: 无论如何，如果犯了错误的人能被善意对待会是件好事，他们的错误是合理的，因此，听取他们对自己所做的事以及为什么失败的解释，确实是很启发人的。这远比玛丽亚·巴蒂罗莫与乔治·索罗斯谈论他愚蠢的反身性理论更具启发性。
