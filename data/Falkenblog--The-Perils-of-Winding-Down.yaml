- en: I drove home listening to a left-wing talk radio show that focused on the $1.8MM
    in bonuses that Hostess Brands is using to retain 19 executives during its wind
    down. They thought this was pure evil and unfair.  Hostess has hundreds of millions
    of dollars in assets, so this is at most 0.5% of the value of the firm. For a
    top guy to get an extra $100k to do this correctly seems cheap.

  zh: 我开车回家听着一个专心研究Hostess Brands花费180万美元给19名高管的奖金的左翼广播节目。他们认为这种做法纯粹邪恶和不公平。Hostess拥有数亿美元的资产，所以这最多也只是公司价值的0.5%。对一名高管来说，得到额外10万美元来正确处理这件事似乎还是很划算的。
- en: It reminds me of a case where after a blow up in the convertible bonds space
    around 2006, the firm decided to wind the fund down. They told employees there
    would be no bonuses, just wind down, and leave. So one guy sold his portfolio
    at bargain basement prices to his favorite brokers. He then had lots of credit
    in the favor bank, and was able to land a great job at a new firm, which since
    then has done very well.

  zh: 这让我想起了2006年次贷市场爆炸后的一个案例，在那之后该公司决定清算基金。他们告知员工不会有奖金，只是清算，然后离开。于是一名员工以极低的价格将自己的投资组合出售给自己钟爱的经纪人。结果他在人际交往中积累了大量人情，然后得以在新公司找到一份好工作，而且该公司自那时起表现优异。
- en: Another fun story is when Niederhoffer blew up in 1997\. As the fund was being
    liquidated, the agent for the liquidation with no skin in the game went to the
    pit to close out a large amount of eurodollar positions. Everyone knew he was
    going one way, and when he asked a price, they all stopped and looked at each
    other, silent. Eventually he sold his positions at such a low price, it was the
    best day ever for at least one firm there. The liquidator did not act in the investor's
    best interest, but he was not incented to.

  zh: '另一个有趣的故事是当Niederhoffer在1997年破产时。在基金被清算的过程中，没有决策权的清算人员前去交易现货利率期货合约。所有人都知道他会选择一种方式，而当他询问价格时，他们都停了下来，并互相看着，保持沉默。最终，他以如此低的价格出售了自己的头寸，这对至少有一家公司来说是有史以来最好的一天。清算人员没有顾及投资者的最大利益，但他并没有受到任何激励。 '
- en: When someone is in charge of a lot money, if you take away direct incentives,
    they will game the system indirectly. It's foolish to think people in charge liquidating
    hundreds of millions of dollars will do this without simply giving away stuff
    to people that can (and will!) be helpful to them later. Navigating the favor
    bank is part of life, and people act in the self interest.

  zh: 当有人负责很多钱时，如果取消直接激励措施，他们会间接地操纵制度。认为负责处理数亿美元款项的人没有简单地向那些看似会对他们日后有帮助的人散发好处是愚蠢的。在人际交往中讨好他人是生活的一部分，人们总是以自身利益行事。
