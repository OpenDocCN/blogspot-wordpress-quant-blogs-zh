- en: We crave simplicity and elegance as human beings. It is the comfort of known
    laws be they physical or those that govern society that provide order to our lives.
    Our notions of the world are neatly boxed by our own limited cognition and inability
    to conceptualize the abstract or unfamiliar. In the financial markets the pronounced
    quest for simplicity has left us with incomplete and inadequate models such as
    the CAPM, beta, mean-variance optimization and the EMH (efficient markets hypothesis).
    Mathematicians are the kings of deriving solutions to complex problems from simple
    abstractions, and this proved to be an irresistable panacea to institutions and
    investors desperate for guidance. Little did they know the destruction that naiive
    deductions borne from complex proofs could wreak on their fragile portfolios.

  zh: 作为人类，我们渴望简单和优雅。已知法则带来的秩序是我们生活舒适的来源，无论是物理法则还是支配社会的法则。我们对世界的概念被我们有限的认知和无法概念化抽象或陌生事物的能力整洁地框住。在金融市场中，对简单的追求给我们留下了不完整和不充分的模型，如CAPM、贝塔、均值-方差优化和有效市场假说（EMH）。数学家是从简单抽象中导出复杂问题解决方案的国王，这成为了一个对渴望指导的机构和投资者不可抗拒的灵丹妙药。他们不知道，从复杂证明中产生的天真推论可能会破坏他们脆弱的投资组合。
- en: If the financial markets could truly be deduced from the inspection of “financial
    laws” we might be able to peer at the workings of price movements as the bi-product
    of an aggregation of simple effects. Volatility ergo gravity, and other laws could
    neatly describe the landscape in which traders and investors operate. The “J and
    K” momentum effect, and the “Fama and French,” and many other “effects” discovered
    could be used as blocks to build a larger pyramid that describes precisely how
    the market works. In the quest to function like other branches of scientific academia,
    finance has created a crippling framework that requires a simple unified theory
    to organize the research. Since professors are no more righteous in defending
    their turf than the common man, we have spent years deeply entrenched in ludicrous
    theoretical debates that could never possibly describe something so complex as
    the stock market.  Followers of this research understand that the original troupe
    of the EMH brigade suppressed all dissenting studies from adding any perspective.
    Their actions taken in some cases to shun contradictory studies were so extreme
    that they shared more in common with radical religious or cult leaders. To say
    that these were true men of science–in the quest to find the truth– would be an
    insult to science itself.

  zh: 如果金融市场真的能从“金融法则”的检查中推导出来，我们或许能够窥视价格波动的工作机制，作为简单效应聚合的副产品。波动性因此引力，以及其他法则可以整洁地描述交易员和投资者操作的环境。所谓的“J和K”动量效应，“法玛和法国人”，以及其他许多“效应”发现可以作为构建更大金字塔的积木，精确描述市场是如何运作的。为了像其他科学学术领域一样运作，金融创造了一个致命的框架，需要一个简单的统一理论来组织研究。由于教授们捍卫自己的领域并不比普通人更有正义感，我们在过去的几年里深深陷入了荒谬的理论争论中，这些争论永远不可能描述像股票市场这样复杂的事物。EMH派的原始队伍压制了所有反对研究的观点，他们采取的某些排斥对立研究的行动如此极端，以至于他们与激进的宗教或邪教领袖有更多的共同点。说这些人是真正的科学家——在寻找真理的过程中——是对科学本身的侮辱。
- en: 'But the beauty of being a religious leader is that few will question your assumptions–to
    be a professor at an Ivy League school is to be an unquestionable authority on
    the subject matter of your specialty. Both your students and members of the industry
    put unquestioning faith in the set of principles and body of knowledge that you
    present.  Bring together a band of such individuals with mutual goals, and invariably
    “groupthink” will prevail. The truth is, after 10 years studying the markets,
    I look back on my days as an MBA and all of my formal training much like a man
    reflecting on his childhood: 1) the naiive simplicity of life that you were presented
    by your parents was designed to shield you from the ambiguities and uncertainty
    of being an adult 2) reality is a lot less orderly than you ever imagined. 3)
    there are no easy answers to seemingly simple questions–the rules to guide your
    life that your parents taught you rarely apply in every situation.  The markets
    are exactly the same– no simple guide will tell us what to do, and even the experienced
    professionals seem to be confounded by relationships or events that they never
    thought possible.'

  zh: 但成为一名宗教领袖的美妙之处在于，很少有人会质疑你的假设——在常春藤盟校担任教授就是在你的专业领域内成为无可置疑的权威。你的学生和行业成员都会对你呈现的原则体系和知识体系抱有无条件的信仰。召集这样一群有共同目标的人，不可避免地“群体思维”将会占上风。真相是，在研究市场10年后，我回顾自己MBA的日子和所有的正规培训，很像一个人在回忆他的童年：1）父母为你呈现的天真简单的生活是为了保护你免受成年生活的模糊性和不确定性的困扰
    2）现实比你想象的要无序得多。3）看似简单的问题没有简单的答案——父母教给你的指导生活的规则在大多数情况下很少适用。市场也是如此——没有简单的指南能告诉我们应该做什么，即使是经验丰富的专业人士似乎也对一些他们从未想象过的关系或事件感到困惑。
- en: The most optimistic quantitative researcher knows deep down that an unexplained
    noise dominates the data that mysteriously eludes linear models such as regression.
    Ardent neural network fans will acknowledge the tremendous instability of turnkey
    applications to improve prediction within the data. What order truly lies beneath
    the noise in financial markets can only be uncovered by exploring all avenues
    without bias or prejudice. If we limit ourselves by the neccessity of explaining
    things in terms that are familiar than we will neccessarily constrict our ability
    to discover the truth. Our desire for simple rules for trading, and simple laws
    for describing our world come at the expense of the reality of what the market
    actually is—anything else is a childhood fairy tale.

  zh: 最乐观的定量研究人员内心深处也知道，未解释的噪声主导着那些神秘地规避线性模型（如回归）的数据。狂热的神经网络爱好者会承认，即插即用的应用在提高数据内的预测方面具有巨大的不稳定性。要想揭开金融市场噪声背后的真正秩序，只能通过无偏见或偏见的全面探索来实现。如果我们局限于用熟悉的概念来解释事物，那么我们必然会限制自己发现真相的能力。我们对交易简单规则的渴望，对我们世界描述简单法则的渴望，都是以市场的真实本质为代价的——其他任何东西都是童年童话。
