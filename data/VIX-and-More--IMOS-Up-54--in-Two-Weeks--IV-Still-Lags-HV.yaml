    is up 54% in two weeks and slightly less than that in the 12 days since I mentioned
    the stock in [IMOS Breaks Out, But Implied Volatility Fails to React](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/imos-breaking-out-but-implied.html).

  zh: ChipMOS Technologies (Bermuda) LTD ([IMOS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IMOS)),
    在两周内上涨了54%，自我在[IMOS突破，但隐含波动率没有反应](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/imos-breaking-out-but-implied.html)一文中提到该股票以来的12天内涨幅略低于这个数字。
- en: While the company did report earnings last Friday, the stock did not appear
    to have an immediate reaction to that report. After trading in a wide range on
    Friday, the stock closed up 1.5%. Yesterday, however, it was off to the races
    again, with the stock up another 14%.

  zh: 虽然公司上周五确实报告了收益，但股票似乎没有对这份报告立即做出反应。在周五的交易中，股票波动较大，最终收盘上涨了1.5%。然而，昨天，它又再次起飞，股票又上涨了14%。
- en: Part of what makes IMOS intriguing is the paucity of public information associated
    with this Taiwan-based company. As a result, the stock is highly responsive to
    technical factors and also has a high emotional component associated with the
    price action.

  zh: IMOS吸引人的一部分是这家基于台湾的公司的公开信息非常有限。因此，该股票对技术因素非常敏感，并且与价格行动有关的情绪成分也很高。
- en: The last time around I posted about IMOS largely because I thought it was interesting
    that a stock which was breaking out ahead of earnings had such low [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (red IV 30 line) in spite of the fact that IMOS was now apparently “in play” at
    least in the minds of some investors. I commented at the time that “the current
    HV 20 of 91 is a better estimate of future volatility than the current IV 30 of
    62.”

  zh: 上次我发帖谈IMOS主要是因为我觉得一个在财报前突破的股票具有如此低的[隐含波动率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)（红线30日IV）是一件有趣的事情，尽管IMOS现在显然“在交易中”至少在一些投资者的脑海中。我当时评论说“当前HV
    20的91是一个比当前IV 30的62更好的未来波动率估计。”
- en: A little less than two weeks later, some interesting things have happened. In
    the one month chart below, once can see that IV 30 has risen to 75, even after
    accounting for the 10% decline following the earnings announcement. With [historical
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (blue HV20 line) now at 102, implied volatility still looks like a conservative
    estimate of the potential future moves in IMOS, particularly when one considers
    that daily trading volumes are now running at about five times the three month
    average.

  zh: 大约两周后，发生了一些有趣的事情。如下面的一个月图表所示，即使考虑到财报公布后股价下跌10%，IV 30也已升至75。现在历史波动率（蓝线HV20）为102，隐含波动率仍然是对IMOS未来潜在走势的保守估计，特别是当考虑到现在日交易量大约是过去三个月平均水平的五倍时。

    has been on the call side.

- en: In terms of trading, this is the type of freight train that I generally prefer
    not to step in front of, but having closed out my long positions, I now find that
    there are a couple of defined risk trades on the short side that have some potential.
