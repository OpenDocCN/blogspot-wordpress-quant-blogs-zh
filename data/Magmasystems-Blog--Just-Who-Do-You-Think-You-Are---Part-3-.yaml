- en: In our last episode, Marc was left without a company to market his famed Unix-based
    word processor, WPScribe. The company who was in charge of marketing it had blown
    the company's monetary resources on the excesses of the mid-80's.

  zh: 在我们上一次的节目中，马克没有了公司来推广他那著名的基于Unix的文字处理软件WPScribe。负责推广该软件的公司在80年代中期的过度消费上耗尽了公司的财政资源。
- en: Marc was a Unix hack at that time.... even though he wrote a word processor
    (and, also, a spreadsheet for Unix, WPSpread), he loved ready through line upon
    line of the Unix kernel.

  zh: 当时马克是一个Unix黑客......尽管他编写了一个文字处理软件（以及为Unix编写的表格软件WPSpread），他喜欢一行又一行地阅读Unix内核。
- en: A small but growing company based on Long Island came a callin' .. their name
    was Computer Associates. Fresh off their buyout of SuperCalc, they were trying
    to come up with a window and application management system for all of their future
    applications. You see, CA envisioned themselves at the time as a software development
    company, even though very few things (if any) were developed by them. Marc was
    interested in the notion of working on this project, but he would have to do it
    all on the IBM PC and MS-DOS! (By the way, the window manager project was cancelled
    on the day that Microsoft announced Windows...)

  zh: 一家位于长岛的小型但成长中的公司打电话来......他们的名字是计算机 associates。刚刚完成了对SuperCalc的收购，他们正在尝试为所有未来的应用程序开发一个窗口和应用程序管理系统。你看，CA当时把自己视为一家软件开发公司，尽管很少有东西（如果有的话）是他们开发的。马克对参与这个项目的想法感兴趣，但他必须全部在IBM
    PC和MS-DOS上完成！(顺便说一下，窗口管理项目在微软宣布Windows的那天被取消了...)
- en: Marc took the challenge.... and in the process, ported the word processor over
    to DOS. However, there was no marketing organization set up to sell the beast.
    At the time, a movement called Shareware had just gotten underway, and had some
    momentum. So, Marc decided to release the word processor as a shareware product,
    selling it for $35 a copy and renaming it "New York Word" (to give it sort of
    an urban feel).

  zh: 马克接受了挑战......在这个过程中，将文字处理软件移植到了DOS上。然而，当时并没有建立营销组织来销售这个怪物。当时，一个名为共享软件的运动刚刚开始，并取得了一些动力。因此，马克决定将文字处理软件作为共享软件产品发布，每份售价35美元，并将其更名为“纽约文字”（给它一种城市的感觉）。
- en: The word processor did very well in the shareware marketplace, selling several
    thousand copies. The initial price was $35, but Marc, who was now doing Windows
    consulting on Wall Street, tried to dissuade people from buying it by raising
    the price to $47\. That only convinced people that the product was now $12 better
    than it was before.

  zh: 文字处理软件在共享软件市场上表现很好，销售了几千份。最初的价格是35美元，但马克现在在华尔街做Windows咨询，试图通过将价格提高到47美元来劝阻人们购买。但这只是让人们相信这个产品比以前好了12美元。
- en: The largest shareware distributor at the time was an organization called PC-SIG.
    They decided to embark on a big marketing campaign by highlighting several shareware
    program. The gist of the ads was to draw a characterture of the author of the
    program, write a little blurb, and show off the ad in magazines like PC Magazine
    and PC World. So, if you have old copies around, you can find a drawing of Marc
    with an elongated face and a lot more hair than he has now!

  zh: 当时最大的共享软件分销商是一个名为PC-SIG的组织。他们决定开展一场大型营销活动，通过突出几个共享软件程序来引起注意。广告的核心是绘制程序作者的漫画，写一段简短的文字，并在PC杂志和PC世界等杂志上展示广告。所以，如果你有旧杂志，你可以找到一个有着长脸和比现在多很多头发的马克的插图！
- en: Now that Marc had a word processor, he needed a nice text editor to go along
    with it. So, New York Word was stripped down, several programmer-friendly features
    were added, and since Marc was into compilers, he put together a C-like macro
    language with which you could program the editor. The editor was called ME, short
    for Magma Editor. The unique thing about this editor was that it came with full
    source code, the first commercial text editor to be marketed that way. Advertisements
    in magazines like Dr. Dobbs Journal and Computer Languages followed, and the editor
    was launched to an unsuspecting public.

  zh: 既然Marc已经有了一个文字处理软件，他需要一个好用的文本编辑器来配合它。因此，纽约单词被简化，增加了一些适合程序员的功能，由于Marc对编译器感兴趣，他组装了一种类似于C的宏语言，可以用它来编程编辑器。这个编辑器被命名为ME，意思是Magma编辑器。这个编辑器独特的地方在于它附带完整的源代码，这是第一种以这种方式市场推广的商业文本编辑器。随后在Dr.
    Dobbs Journal和Computer Languages等杂志上进行了广告宣传，这款编辑器被推向了毫不知情的公众。
- en: So now, Magma Systems was born. It consisted of Marc doing his Goldman Sachs
    gig during the day, and packing boxes full of editors and word processors at night.
    And, occasionally fielding the tech support call from Europe at 3AM in the morning...
    people who had no idea that the clocks were different when you crossed over the
    Atlantic.

  zh: 于是，Magma系统诞生了。它由Marc在白天做他的高盛证券工作，晚上则打包装满编辑器和文字处理器的盒子。偶尔，在凌晨3点还要接来自欧洲的客服电话...那些不知道当你横越大西洋时，时钟会有所不同的人们。
