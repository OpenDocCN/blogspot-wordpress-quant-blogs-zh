- en: The benefit of capitalism can’t have much to do with profit incentives per se,
    since (almost) every employee of a modern firm is a not an owner, and hence is
    incentivized to work hard only by her labor contract. A government agency could
    conceivably use precisely the same set of contracts and get precisely the same
    outcome as the private firm (the principle-agent problem is identical in the two
    cases).

  zh: 资本主义的好处与利润激励本身无关，因为（几乎）现代公司所有员工都不是公司所有者，因此只有通过劳动合同来激励自己努力工作。政府机构可能可以使用完全相同的合同，并得到与私人公司完全相同的结果（在这两种情况下，委托人-代理人问题是相同的）。
- en: 'This is wrong. I''ve worked in small and large firms, and in either case, being
    part of any initiative that makes money increases your pay and stature rather
    clearly. Now, the bigger the firm, the more people involved in any initiative,
    and the more people will exaggerate their involvement with successful projects
    and downplay their involvement in losers. But the bottom line is the bottom line,
    and the best way to get your boss to appreciate you more is to help him make more
    money for the firm. The scope of your command is rarely specified in detail, though
    increases in scope are the most obvious ways of increasing your power when the
    ''contract'' comes up for renegotiation: work is a repeated game. The government
    principle has a very different objective function than the private firm principle,
    the former with a diverse set of stakeholders to satisfy, often with vague and
    inconsistent objectives, the latter to simply make more profits.'

  zh: 这是错误的。我曾在小公司和大公司工作过，在任何情况下，参与能够赚钱的任何举措都会明确地增加你的报酬和地位。现在，公司越大，参与任何举措的人越多，这些人可能夸大自己参与成功项目的程度，并淡化自己参与失败项目的程度。但最后的结果要看企业的最终收益。帮助老板赚更多钱对他给予更多的欣赏是最好的做法。虽然你的职责范围很少被明确规定，但当“合同”重新谈判时，适度的增加自己的职责范围是增加自己的权力的最明显的方法：因为工作是一个重复的游戏。政府原则与私人公司原则的目标函数非常不同，前者要满足有很多利益相关者的利益，常常有模棱两可和不一致的目标，而后者则仅仅是增加利润。
- en: It's true that some people, especially those in over their heads, who are overpaid,
    dislike productive and smart direct reports because they sense their boss will
    recognize an attractive replacement. Yet even here the incentive clearly exists
    for this bad boss to be replaced by his boss, because his boss is not optimizing
    this position in that case (and watching the bad bosses employees leave when they
    recognize this is a really good signal that their boss is not a good one). It's
    also true that salaried employees like cashiers and secretaries may not be proactive
    about increasing their stature within the firm and simply follow orders, but their
    bosses recognize this and so are less likely to increase their responsibility.Every
    ambitious worker tries to make more with less all the time, because they can quantify
    this, which is the best way to go into an annual performance review. Just because
    you do not have shares in the firm does not mean you aren't highly incented to
    make money for shareholders, because the shareholder desire for more profits truly
    trickles down.

  zh: 赚钱能力较强，有白手起家的人对那些被过度工作和过高薪酬的人格外讨厌。因为后者感觉到老板会发现其他更有吸引力的替代者。不过，即使在这种情况下，对这样坏老板的老板来说，也明确存在激励因素来替换他，因为在这种情况下，他的老板并不会把这个位置最大化（当坏老板的员工离开时，他的老板也会意识到这是一个很好的迹象说明其员工不是一个好老板）。薪酬制雇员，如收银员和秘书可能不会积极主动地提高自己在公司内的地位，只是听话服从命令，但他们的老板意识到这一点，因此不太可能增加他们的责任。每个有抱负的工作者都努力做到做更多、使用更少，因为他们可以量化这一点，这是最好的改进方法进入年度绩效评审。仅仅因为你在公司没有股份，不意味着你不是为了股东赚钱而极有激励，因为股东对利润的追求确实会逐级传递。
