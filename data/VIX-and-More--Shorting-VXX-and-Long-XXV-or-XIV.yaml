  zh: '我可能已经收到了数百个关于做空[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) advisability的问题和评论，以及成功执行此类策略的一些障碍。随着[XXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XXV)的到来，一些投资者认为VXX的反向版本可能是实现同样目标的一个更好的方法。结果证明，XXV的表现并没有像做空VXX的位置那样好，《Case
    Solved: No Arbitrage》深入探讨了数学问题，并反向工程了一个计算XXV相对于做空VXX位置表现的优秀公式。我强烈建议点击查看详情。'

  zh: 最后，我在包括我的[订阅者通讯](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)在内的多次场合注意到了这一点，VelocityShares
    Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV))是复制做空VXX位置的一个更好的产品，而不是XXV。投资者尚未得出与我相同的结论，即2011年将是基于VIX的ETN和ETF的“失控成功的一年，特别是最近推出的XIV，这将进一步证明波动性工具也可以是好的买入并持有的投资”，但我仍在坚守我的[预测](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)，并密切关注资金流入XIV需要多长时间。
- en: 'I have probably received hundreds of questions and comments related to the
    advisability of shorting [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and some of the obstacles in being able to execute such a strategy successfully.
    With the arrival of [XXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XXV), some
    investors thought that the inverse version of VXX might be a better way to accomplish
    the same goal. As it turns out, XXV has not performed as well as a short VXX position
    and *Case Solved: No Arbitrage* dives into the math and reverse engineers an excellent
    formula for calculating just how XXV performs relative to a short VXX position.
    I highly recommend clicking through to review the details.'

- en: Finally, I have noted on a number of occasions, including at some length in
    my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/), that the
    VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN ([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV))
    is a better product for replicating a short VXX position than XXV. Investors have
    yet to arrive at the same conclusion as I have that 2011 will mark “the runaway
    success of [VIX-based ETNs and ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    notably the recently launched XIV, which will prove that volatility vehicles can
    be good buy-and-hold investments,” but I am standing by my [prediction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)
    and watching with interest to see how long it takes for money to start flowing
    into XIV.
