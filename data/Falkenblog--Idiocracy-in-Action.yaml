    issues trading off redistribution and efficiency. As most people have instincts
    on the long run effects of their favored policies but no definitive proof, people
    tend to be get very frustrated and emotional discussing these issues because we

- en: National politics is about convincing the demographic that votes for American
    Idol to agree with you.  When I used to teach at Northwestern University I occasionally
    asked what students thought about popular topics like  'free trade' or 'market
    efficiency'. Their opinions were so poorly articulated and founded, I stopped
    doing that. It did not help to have people riff on subjects they really didn't
    understand, the errors were so numerous and fundamental it simply was a waste
    of time.  I realized then that gaining their support would either rely on authority--believe
    me because I have these credentials--or slick salesmanship. Both methods are not
    good at converging upon truth. In the end I tried to explain some fundamental
    ideas showing why, given certain assumptions, one could think something was optimal,
    so the best case scenario was not definitive anyway.

  zh: 国家政治实际上是说服《美国偶像》选民同意你的。当我曾经在西北大学教书时，我偶尔问学生们对像“自由贸易”或“市场效率”这样的流行话题有何看法。他们的观点表述得如此糟糕并且基础薄弱，以至于我就不再问了。人们滔滔不绝地谈论他们实际上并不了解的主题，并且错误太多太基本，简直就是浪费时间。我当时意识到获得他们的支持要么依靠权威--相信我因为我有这些证明--要么靠巧舌如簧。这两种方法都不利于达成真理。最终，我试图解释一些基本理念，展示为什么在特定假设下，人们会认为某种观点是最优的，但最佳情况也不是明确的。
- en: In this environment it's sad that the great unwashed directly elect a person
    with the power to make decisions over whether we should spend another $800B, or
    choose judges for their biases (given smart lawyers, is not hard to do for almost
    any bias).  This is not a wise way to make policy. Unfortunately, alternatives
    aren't obvious, and certainly not popular. For example, something akin to a literacy
    test would enhance our voting competence, but would statistically discriminate
    against certain groups, and I'm doubtful it would be more enlightened anyway. The
    old belief of J.S. Mill that if we merely educated everyone we would agree and
    choose wise policies is clearly wrong.

  zh: 在这种环境下，令人遗憾的是，普通大众直接选出了一个拥有决策权的人，而这个人可以决定我们是否应该再花800亿美元，或者为他们的偏见选择法官（鉴于聪明的律师，几乎可以轻易为任何偏见选择）。这不是制定政策的明智方式。不幸的是，替代方案并不明显，而且当然也不受欢迎。例如，类似素质测试的东西会提高我们的投票能力，但会在统计上歧视某些群体，而且我怀疑它也不会更明智。J.S.密尔的旧观念认为，如果我们只是教育了每个人，我们就会达成共识并选择明智的政策，显然是错误的。

- en: --power gets more concentrated in the President or Emperor. I think this is
    because when a state is small, an aristocracy/oligarchy is concentrated enough
    to work, but it doesn't scale. At a certain point the aristocracy is fragmented
    but the titular head retains his power,  which is then amplified by his new relative
    strength, making the legislative branch a veto at best, a patronage machine at
    worst.  The House and Senate remain more powerful than the President, but they
    seem to lose stature every decade.

  zh: --权力更加集中在总统或皇帝手中。我认为这是因为当一个国家很小的时候，贵族/寡头政治足够集中进行运作，但它不可扩展。在某一点上，贵族们开始分裂，但名义上的首领保留了他的权力，这时他的相对实力就被放大了，使得立法部门在最好的情况下成为否决权，最坏的情况下成为一个赏赐机器。众议院和参议院比总统更有权力，但他们似乎每十年都失去一些威望。
- en: But most importantly for this day, voting in big elections does not matter at
    all. Consider you live in Florida, which decides the presidential election. You
    cast the deciding vote, your candidate winning by 1 vote. In such a case, the
    stakes are so high that very good lawyers would be called in, and the better or
    more powerful lawyers would find the definition of what constitutes a legitimate
    vote such that your decisive vote would be irrelevant. That is, lawyers can use
    one of several metrics of voting, some of which will show their candidate winning,
    some losing, for any close election (just like polls generate different results
    depending on demographics). That's what happened in Minnesota, where the Republican
    was winning the senate race by 700 hundred votes, but the much stronger Democratic
    party in this state had a much more vigorous counsel helping them 'recount' the
    votes, and

  zh: 但最重要的是，在大选中投票完全没有意义。比如你住在决定总统选举结果的佛罗里达州。你投下了决定性的一票，你的候选人以1票的优势获胜。在这种情况下，赌注非常高，非常优秀的律师们会介入，更好或更有权力的律师们会找到一个什么才算合法投票的定义，使得你的决定性投票会变得无关紧要。也就是说，律师们可以使用几种投票度量标准，有些将显示他们的候选人获胜，有些则是失败，对于任何接近的选举（就像民意调查根据不同的人口统计数据会产生不同的结果一样）。这就是发生在明尼苏达州的情况，那里共和党人以700票的优势赢得参议院选举，但这个州的民主党却有一个更有力量的律师团帮助他们“重新计票”，并且
