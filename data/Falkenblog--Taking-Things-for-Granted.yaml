- en: 'I think 2008''s problem was mainly because after the rating agencies were exposed
    as making an error on their AAA and AA ratings, all investors viewed such securities
    skeptically. What was previously an asset class that did not require much thought,
    now need re-underwriting: evaluating the credit from the bottom up. This is very
    difficult, invariably there are many assumptions (especially for derivatives),
    and you find very quickly that there are lots of unknowns that are potentially
    dangerous. Usually, these assumptions are benign, but as the mortgage crisis proved,
    you can''t rest on ''usually''.'

  zh: 我认为2008年的问题主要是因为在评级机构暴露出对他们的AAA和AA评级存在错误后，所有投资者都怀疑这类证券。以前不需要太多思考的资产类型现在需要重新评估，从底层评估信用。这是非常困难的，通常有很多假设（特别是衍生品），你很快就会发现有很多潜在的危险未知因素。通常来说，这些假设是良性的，但正如抵押贷款危机所证明的，你不能仅仅依赖于“通常”。
- en: Looking at the AAA and AA ratings, which had had annual default rates of 0.01%
    and 0.03%, it is a wonder this did not happen earlier. With such low default rates,
    inevitably, mimics would exploit this because those buying such securities are
    not doing their own due diligence. You just have to find the right buzz words,

- en: As Whitehead notes we make advances by putting complex tasks into processes
    that are automated, or applying generalizations so that we do not need to know
    particulars. When we have to stop and think about everything, our productivity
    shrinks drastically. It's a good thing for investors, especially large investors,
    to re-underwrite anything they have a large stake it. Unfortunately, changing
    regimes involves a lot of tumult, which is what constipated the savings-investment

- en: Bernie Madoff's scam will also leave a big mark. Previously, a hedge fund could
    get away with merely showing returns, and be vague about how they were making
    money. Now, they need not only that, but a story. Where is the alpha coming from?
    Anyone doing due diligence needs to do the simple things, like seeing if a 'conversion
    strike strategy' is remotely plausible in generating promised returns. I think
    this will greatly slow the rebound in hedge funds, because some hedge funds think
    that when things recover, money will again flow into hedge funds, but the game
    has changed. A hedge fund now needs to articulate a story that is both plausible,
    yet does not reveal too much, because you don't want to tell people exactly what
    you are doing. I suspect many more systematic funds will have real problems here,
    pounding the table that their firm head is 'well-known' and trusted, and in combination
    with returns, implies investors do not 'need to know' details about the alpha
    generating process. As an investor, given Madoff, such trust would be foolish.

  zh: 伯尼·梅多夫的骗局也将留下深远的影响。 以前，对冲基金只需展示收益率，并模糊地说明他们是如何赚钱的。 现在，他们不仅需要这些，还需要一个故事。 Alpha来自何处？
    做尽尽职调查的人需要做一些简单的事情，比如看看“转换打击策略”是否可能产生承诺的回报。 我认为这将大大减缓对冲基金的复苏，因为一些对冲基金认为当事情恢复正常时，资金将再次流入对冲基金，但游戏已经改变了。
    现在，对冲基金需要表达一个既可信，又不要透露太多的故事，因为你不想告诉人们你到底在做什么。 我怀疑许多系统性基金在这里会有真正的问题，大肆宣扬他们公司的领头人是“著名的”和可信任的，并且结合回报，暗示投资者不需要了解alpha产生过程的细节。
    作为一个投资者，在梅多夫事件之后，这样的信任是愚蠢的。
