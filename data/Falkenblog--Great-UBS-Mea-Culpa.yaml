    70% of the losses came from their fixed income group. 15% came from the Dillon
    Read Capital Management (acquired in only 2005), and the rest, other, all pretty
    much based on the subprime, and its affect on other structure product spreads.

  zh: 报告详细梳理了整个混乱局面，并强调了工作中的几个问题。70%的损失来自他们的固定收益部门。15%来自仅在2005年收购的狄龙·里德资本管理公司，其余的则主要基于次级贷款及其对其他结构性产品利差的影响。
- en: Much of the growth in the Fixed Income group came from fat fees on repackaging
    residential mortgages from the US into mezzanine (ie, Ba rated) CDOs and reselling
    them. This generated fees of about 150 basis points, compared to fees of only
    40 basis points on senior tranches. Now, in fixed income, 150 basis points is
    a lot of spread, so you have to wonder where they thought this edge was coming
    from. Its like, if someone told you they could repackage US Treasuries, take out
    50 basis points, and make everyone happy. The spreads are just too thin, you can
    only get this kind of edge by taking huge risk, in Treasuries for example, it
    implies there must be some kind of yield curve bet, or selling some swaption,
    and in these markets, they just aren't that inefficient to think 50 basis points
    is there no matter how smart you are. If they thought there was 150 basis points
    in free alpha via repackaging pools of RMBS, they should have done the math. So
    the spreads alone should have been a warning signal, and suggest senior management
    was ignorant of the basic pricing and historical performance of credit returns.
    It was doomed based on this analysis alone.

  zh: 固定收益部门的大部分增长源于将美国住宅抵押贷款重新打包成夹层（即Ba评级）CDO并转售，从中收取高额费用。这些费用约为150个基点，相比之下，高级层级的费用仅为40个基点。在固定收益领域，150个基点的利差相当可观，因此不得不让人怀疑他们认为这种优势从何而来。这就像有人告诉你他们能重新打包美国国债，抽取50个基点，还能让所有人满意。利差实在太薄，要获得这种优势只能通过承担巨大风险，例如在国债市场上，这意味着必须进行某种收益率曲线赌博，或出售某种掉期期权，而在这些市场中，它们并不那么低效，以至于无论你多么聪明，50个基点都不存在。如果他们认为通过重新打包RMBS池可以获得150个基点的免费阿尔法，他们应该进行数学计算。因此，仅利差本身就应该是一个警告信号，表明高级管理层对信用回报的基本定价和历史表现无知。仅基于这一分析，它就注定失败。
- en: The 150 basis points on the mezzanine piece necessitated keeping about 60% of
    the RMBS on their books, both the super senior pieces, and the first-loss pieces.
    But this looked good, because as a AAA rated bank, they funded everything at this
    ridiculously low rate, and so made positive carry on this stuff. So it seemed
    like arbitrage. They also bought AAA rated ABS of various collateral, and, because
    ABS AAA trades above bank AAA rates, had positive carry on this. When the mortgage
    market blew up, everything in structured finance cratered even though asset quality
    was pretty unchanged, and they exited with a loss in the third quarter of 2007
    on things backed by credit cards and autos, merely because spreads widened.

  zh: 夹层部分的150个基点要求他们将大约60%的RMBS留在账上，包括超高级部分和首损部分。但这看起来不错，因为作为AAA级银行，他们以极低的利率为所有这些融资，从而在这些资产上实现了正向套利。这看似套利。他们还购买了各种抵押品的AAA级ABS，并且由于ABS的AAA级交易利率高于银行AAA级利率，因此也实现了正向套利。当抵押贷款市场崩溃时，尽管资产质量几乎没有变化，但结构化金融中的所有产品都崩盘了，他们在2007年第三季度因信用卡和汽车支持的资产而退出时蒙受了损失，仅仅是因为利差扩大。

- en: 'The bank had several groups evaluating risk, and so no own had real ownership
    of the issue. One group, internal audit, did 250 such reviews a year, so their
    rather perfunctory review is understandable--any group that does 250 risk reviews
    a year is worthless, because they don''t have the clout to tell anyone with power
    no, they have too much to do to fight such a battle. Furthermore, only 5 years
    of data on RMBS pricing was used for stress tests and Value at Risk. Given the
    2000-2005 period was benign, this understated the risk significantly. Any stress
    test or VAR needs to count observations in terms of cycles, not days: 1990 hotels,
    1990 Commercial mortgage backed securities, 1997-8 emerging markets, 2001 CDOs
    and telecom, 1996 credit card, 1994 yield curve, and draw inferences from different
    products, because the historical losses of one type of derivative over 5 years
    is just not sufficient to get a real sense of a worst-case-scenario.'

  zh: 银行有几个团队评估风险，因此没有一个团队真正拥有问题的所有权。其中一个团队，内部审计，每年进行250次这样的审查，所以他们的审查相当草率是可以理解的——任何每年进行250次风险审查的团队都是无价值的，因为他们没有足够的权威去告诉任何有权势的人不，他们有太多的事情要做，无法为此战斗。此外，只使用了5年的RMBS定价数据进行压力测试和风险价值评估。鉴于2000-2005年期间是良性的，这大大低估了风险。任何压力测试或风险价值评估都需要以周期而非天数来计算观察结果：1990年的酒店，1990年的商业抵押贷款支持证券，1997-8年的新兴市场，2001年的CDO和电信，1996年的信用卡，1994年的收益率曲线，并从不同产品中得出推论，因为一种衍生品在过去5年的历史损失不足以真正了解最坏情况场景。
- en: Further, they assumed normality, because they assumed these were tradeable assets,
    and over short horizons, even asymmetrically distributed credit instruments are
    well approximated by a normal distribution. But the secondary market for derivatives
    is much less liquid than the prices indicate, because these instruments are dominated
    by new issues, so you get lots of data that seems to be moving like a futures
    price, but in practice, you can't sell an outstanding issue at anything like these
    prices. When the market collapsed and many firms wanted to exit these positions,
    the losses were highly asymmetric, typical of credit cycles. One should apply
    annual worst-case-scenarios, applying the losses from the adverse cycles above,
    to anticipate correctly for such losses on these kinds of instruments. I'm only
    42, but I've seen it many times, and every business line has managers who have
    a 10 year plus spotless record, but this is merely survivorship bias within the
    firm.

  zh: 此外，他们假设了正态分布，因为他们认为这些是可以交易的资产，并且在短期内，即使是非对称分布的信用工具也能很好地近似于正态分布。但衍生品的二级市场流动性远低于价格所显示的，因为这些工具主要由新发行主导，所以你会得到大量看似像期货价格一样波动的数据，但实际上，你无法以这些价格出售已发行的证券。当市场崩溃，许多公司想要退出这些头寸时，损失是非对称的，这是信用周期的典型特征。应该应用年度最坏情况场景，应用上述不利周期的损失，以正确预期这类工具的此类损失。我虽然只有42岁，但我已经见过很多次，每个业务线都有拥有10年以上无瑕记录的经理，但这只是公司内部的幸存者偏差。

  zh: 总之，他们似乎犯了三个关键错误。
- en: First, that warehousing AAA ABS paper added value to the bank. Warehousing prime
    paper funded at their AAA rate was merely abusing their internal funding. The
    profits from the portion they sold as mezzanine tranches was intoxicating, but
    left residual risk via the unpackaged debt (equity and super-senior) that only
    looked profitable because they were funded incorrectly. This massive residual
    was only tenable because it seemed to generate profits, not costs.

  zh: 首先，仓储AAA级ABS证券为银行增加了价值。以AAA级利率融资的优质证券仅仅是滥用内部资金。他们出售的夹层部分所带来的利润令人陶醉，但通过未包装的债务（股权和超高级）留下了剩余风险，这些债务看似盈利，只是因为融资不当。这种巨大的剩余风险之所以能够维持，是因为它似乎产生了利润而非成本。
- en: Secondly, their risk metrics were based on short, biased samples, and one should
    assume that any credit can be just like Telecom in 2001\. Credit has to use long
    investment horizons, and highly asymmetric return characteristics, because that
    is the game. A bond is really like selling out-of-the-money puts on equity, because
    you make money 80% of the time, and lose 20%, and historically, the returns to
    High Yield bonds has basically been the same as Investment Grade. Don't expect
    to make money warehousing credits--its a cost of intermediating, not a benefit.
    Banks like UBS should recognize their value-add comes from intermediating, not
    warehousing. Warehousing is a residual effect as part of being a dealer, but there
    should be strict ex ante limits on this stuff precisely because any such assets
    on the balance sheet are, at best, treading water--any positive carry is from
    perverse funding rates, especially considering these are generally going to be
    first loss positions. Basically, the structured group was generating these fees,
    at seemingly positive carry, but it was implausible there was ever this much edge
    in the assets.

  zh: 其次，他们的风险指标基于短期、有偏的样本，应假设任何信贷都可能像2001年的电信业一样。信贷必须采用长期投资视野和高度不对称的回报特征，因为这就是游戏规则。债券实际上类似于出售价外股票看跌期权，因为你80%的时间赚钱，20%的时间亏损，而历史数据显示，高收益债券的回报基本上与投资级债券相同。不要期望通过囤积信贷来赚钱——这是中介的成本，而非收益。像瑞银这样的银行应该认识到，他们的增值来自于中介，而非囤积。囤积只是作为交易商的附带效应，但对此应有严格的预先限制，因为这些资产在资产负债表上最多只是维持现状——任何正的利差都来自扭曲的融资利率，尤其考虑到这些通常是首损位置。基本上，结构化团队在看似正利差的情况下产生了这些费用，但实际上资产中从未有过这么大的优势。
