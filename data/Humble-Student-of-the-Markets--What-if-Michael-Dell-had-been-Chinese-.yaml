- en: . Many of the writers fretted about how much of a visionary Steve Jobs was and
    how he transformed computing from an activity for geeks to something cool and
    user friendly. The tone of the response was very much from the gut. It reminds
    me of the companies built in China and other parts of Asia by visionary founders.
    My answer has always been that Apple is an American company and it is staffed
    by good people, all of whom are not named Steve Jobs.

  zh: . 许多作者都在担忧史蒂夫·乔布斯作为一个远见者以及他是如何将计算从极客的活动转变为酷炫且用户友好的东西。这些回应的调调非常发自内心。这让我想起了在中国和其他亚洲地区由有远见的创始人建立的公司。我一直认为苹果是一家美国公司，它由优秀的人组成，他们中没有一个人叫史蒂夫·乔布斯。
- en: This got me to thinking, what if Apple had been an Asian company? For a better
    example, what if Michael Dell had been a Chinese entrepreneur? I believe that
    Dell is a better example because Apple has re-invented itself several times over
    the years, while Dell has remained largely in the same business.

  zh: 这让我思考起来，如果苹果是一家亚洲公司会怎样？为了更好的例子，如果迈克尔·戴尔是一个中国企业家会怎样？我认为戴尔是一个更好的例子，因为苹果在多年的时间里已经重新定义了自己，而戴尔基本上一直从事相同的事业。

- en: Supposing Tycoon Michael had been quick to spot opportunity. He wouldn't have
    just stayed in the PC business but diversified into other unrelated businesses.
    As the Tech Bubble reached its peak and collapsed, he would have seen the opportunity
    in housing and diversified into homebuilding (Dell Homes). Perhaps he saw the
    Chinese boom and saw the opportunity in resource extraction and diversified into
    those industries (Dell Resources, or Dell Oil & Gas). As the Chinese boom continued,
    Tycoon Michael may have seen that while China began to own and control more resources
    overseas, one critical chokepoint in the supply chain was transportation, thus
    Dell Shipping was born. As the Chinese authorities began to clamp down on lending
    in order to slow their overheated economy, Tycoon Michael would have seen that
    there was money to be made in the shadow banking industry (Dell Financial).

  zh: 假设大亨迈克尔很快就能发现机会。他不会仅仅停留在个人电脑业务上，而是多元化到其他不相关的业务上。当科技泡沫达到顶峰并崩溃时，他看到了住房的机会，并多元化到了房地产开发（戴尔家园）。也许他看到了中国繁荣，看到了资源开采的机会，并多元化到了那些行业（戴尔资源，或戴尔石油天然气）。随着中国繁荣的继续，大亨迈克尔可能已经看到，虽然中国开始拥有和控制更多的海外资源，供应链中的一个关键瓶颈是运输，因此戴尔航运诞生了。当中国当局开始收紧贷款以减缓过热的经济时，大亨迈克尔会看到影子银行行业中有利可图（戴尔金融）。
