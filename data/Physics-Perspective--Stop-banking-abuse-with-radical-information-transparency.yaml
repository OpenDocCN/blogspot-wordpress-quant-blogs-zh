    about an important developing body of work showing how algorithms -- closely linked
    to Google's PageRank algorithm -- could be used to greatly increase transparency
    surrounding issues of systemic risk. The systemic risk linked to any one bank
    or even to any single financial transaction could be made apparent to everyone;
    call it "radical transparency." Coupled with other mechanisms, such transparency
    could provide a route to making the system safer on is own, through normal economic
    self organization. The idea, in essence, is to use computation to give everyone
    in the market the information they need to make better choices.

    to make the full pre-specified re-payments. It is usually seen as a risk that
    emerges between two counterparties once they engage in a financial transaction.
    The lender is the sole bearer of credit risk, and figures the likelihood of failed
    repayments into a risk premium. Lenders usually charge higher interest rates to
    borrowers that are more likely to default (risk-based pricing). Credit risk is
    relatively well understood, and can be mitigated through a number methods and
    techniques [18]. The Basle accords provide an extensive framework dealing foremost
    with the mitigation of credit risk [19–21].

- en: When two counterparties are part of a financial system, for example as nodes
    in a financial network, the situation changes, and their transaction may affect
    the financial system as a whole. The lender no more is the sole bearer of credit
    risk, nor does credit risk depend on the financial conditions of the borrower
    alone. The impact of a default of the borrower is no longer limited to the lender,
    but it may affect the other creditors of the lender (who also lend to the same
    borrower) as well as their creditors, and so on. Similarly, the lender is not
    only vulnerable to a default of the borrower but also to defaults from all debtors
    of that borrower as well as their debtors, etc. In financial networks credit risk
    loses the local character between two counterparties, and becomes systemic.

  zh: 当两个交易方成为金融体系的一部分时，例如作为金融网络中的节点，情况就会发生变化，它们的交易可能会影响整个金融体系。放贷人不再单独承担信用风险，信用风险也不再仅仅取决于借款人的财务状况。借款人违约的影响不再仅限于放贷人，而是可能影响放贷人的其他债权人（他们也向同一借款人放贷）以及这些债权人的债权人，依此类推。同样，放贷人不仅面临借款人违约的风险，还可能面临该借款人的所有债务人以及这些债务人的债务人等的违约风险。在金融网络中，信用风险失去了两个交易方之间的局部特征，变成了系统性风险。

    can no longer perform its function as a credit provider and collapses. SR is a
    result of the network nature of financial transactions and liabilities in the
    financial system. It unfolds as secondary cascades of credit defaults, triggered
    by credit defaults between individual counterparties. These cascades can potentially
    wipe out the financial system by a de-leveraging cascade [22–29]. It is obvious
    that lenders have a strong incentive to mitigate credit risk. In the case of SR
    the situation is less clear, since the loss-bearers will in general not be directly
    involved in those transactions that trigger systemic damage. It is not obvious
    which players in the financial system have a true interest to mitigate SR. Management
    of SR is foremost in the public interest.

  zh: 系统性风险（SR）是指整个金融体系或其大部分无法再作为信贷提供者发挥功能并崩溃的风险。系统性风险是金融体系中金融交易和负债网络性质的结果。它表现为由个别交易方之间的信用违约触发的二级级联违约，这些级联可能会通过去杠杆化级联[22-29]彻底摧毁金融体系。很明显，放贷人有强烈的动机减轻信用风险。在系统性风险的情况下，情况就不那么明确了，因为一般来说，承担损失的一方不会直接参与触发系统性损害的交易。在金融体系中，哪些参与者真正有动力减轻系统性风险并不明显。管理系统性风险首先符合公共利益。

    node lends to a systemically non-risky one, the later inherits SR from the risky
    node, since if the non-risky borrower should (for whatever reason) not repay the
    loan, the risky node would trigger systemic damage. In this sense SR spreads from
    the risky through lending.

  zh: 需要注意的是，系统性风险通过放贷传播。如果一个系统风险节点向一个非系统风险节点放贷，后者的系统性风险会从风险节点继承，因为如果非风险借款人由于任何原因未能偿还贷款，风险节点会触发系统性损害。从这个意义上说，系统性风险通过放贷从风险节点传播。

- en: SR is predominantly a network property of liability networks. Different financial
    network topologies will have different probabilities for systemic collapse, given
    the link density and the financial conditions of nodes being the same. The management
    of SR becomes a technical problem of managing the network topology of financial
    networks. The goal is to do this in a way that does neither reduce the credit
    provision capacity, nor the transaction volume of the financial system. Data on
    the topology of credit networks is available to many central banks. Several studies
    on historical data show typical scale-free connectivity patterns in liability
    networks [30–35], including overnight markets [36], and financial flows [37].
    As a network property, SR can be quantified by using networkmetrics [38, 39].
    In particular a relative risk measure (DebtRank) can be assigned to all nodes
    in a financial network that specifies the fraction of SR they contribute to the
    system (institution- or node-specific SR) [39]. As shown later, it is natural
    to extend the notion of node-specific SR to individual liabilities between two
    counterparties (liability-specific SR), and to individual transactions (transaction-specific
    SR).

  zh: SR 主要是有责网络的网络属性。在节点间的连结密度和金融状况相同的情况下，不同的金融网络拓扑将具有不同的系统性崩溃概率。SR 的管理成为了一个技术问题，即管理金融网络的拓扑结构。目标是以一种既不减少金融系统的信用提供能力，也不减少交易量的方式来做到这一点。许多中央银行可以获得信贷网络拓扑数据。一些利用历史数据的研究显示了负债网络中典型的无标度连通性模式[30-35]，包括隔夜市场[36]和金融流动[37]。作为一种网络属性，SR
    可以通过使用网络指标[38, 39]来量化。特别是，可以给金融网络中的所有节点分配一个相对风险度量（债务等级），该度量指定它们为系统贡献的SR的比例（机构或节点特定的SR）[39]。如后来所示，自然地将节点特定的SR的概念扩展到两个对手方之间的个别负债（负债特定的SR），以及个别交易（交易特定的SR）是合理的。

- en: 'The central idea of this paper is to introduce an incentive structure in form
    of a transaction tax that dynamically structures liability networks such that
    SR is minimized. Since every transaction in a financial network has an impact
    on the overall SR of a system, we suggest a transaction tax on all transactions
    between any two market participants that increase the SR of the entire system.
    The size of the tax is proportional to the SR contribution of the particular transaction.
    Market participants looking for credit will try to avoid this tax by looking for
    credit opportunities that do not increase SR and are thus tax free. As a consequence
    the network arranges toward a topology that, in combination with the financial
    conditions of individual institutions, will lead to a defacto elimination of SR,
    meaning that cascading failures can no longer occur. In the spirit of risk-based
    pricing as it is used for credit risk, here we propose a systemic risk premium.
    It was shown in [39] that SR can be drastically reduced by reducing borrowing
    from systemically risky nodes. This is achieved by distributing SR evenly over
    the network and by preventing the emergence of systemically super-risky nodes.
    The mechanism works in a self-organized way: risky nodes reduce their SR because
    they are blocked from lending, non-risky nodes become more systemically risky
    through their lending. A SR premium encourages borrowers to borrow from safer
    lenders (since the borrower pays the tax). Further, lenders have an incentive
    to become systemically safe so that no (or only little) SRT is added to their
    loan offers, and they can offer competitive rates. Since mitigation of SR is foremost
    in the public interest we propose to charge a systemic risk tax as a margin on
    every financial transaction that increases global SR.'

  zh: 本文的核心思想是引入一种以交易税形式激励结构，动态构建责任网络，以最小化系统风险（SR）。由于金融网络中的每一笔交易都会对系统的整体SR产生影响，我们建议对所有增加整个系统SR的交易征收交易税。税收的大小与特定交易的SR贡献成比例。寻求信贷的市场参与者为了规避这笔税收，会寻找不会增加SR且因此免税的信贷机会。因此，网络会趋向于一种拓扑结构，结合个别机构的金融条件，将导致SR的事实消除，这意味着级联故障再也不会发生。在基于风险定价的精神下，如同信贷风险所使用的那样，我们在此提出系统风险溢价。正如文献[39]中所显示的，通过减少从系统风险节点借款，可以大幅降低SR。这是通过将SR均匀地分布在整个网络上来实现的，并防止出现系统超级风险节点。这一机制以自我组织的方式工作：风险节点减少其SR，因为它们被阻止借款，非风险节点通过其借款变得更加系统风险。SR溢价鼓励借款人向更安全的放贷人借款（因为借款人支付税收）。此外，放贷人有动力变得系统安全，以便在其贷款报价中没有（或只有很少）SRT增加，并且他们可以提供有竞争力的利率。由于减轻SR主要是公共利益，我们建议对每笔增加全球SR的金融交易征收系统风险税作为margin。
