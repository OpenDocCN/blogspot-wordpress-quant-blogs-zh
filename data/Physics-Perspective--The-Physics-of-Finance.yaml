- en: In the spring of 2009, in the wake of the recent financial crisis, economists
    gathered at a conference in Dahlem, Germany for five days of discussion on the
    economic modeling of financial markets. After the meeting, the group issued a
    joint statement on the economic profession's failure to either see the financial
    crisis coming or to judge its ultimate severity. The lack of understanding, they
    suggested [in the conference report](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/papers/Dahlem_Report_EconCrisis021809.pdf),

- en: The full report makes good reading. Most importantly, it singles out the lack
    of realistic market dynamics as the primary failing of the standard models used
    by economists. These models assume that markets tend to a state of balance or
    equilibrium, and pay no attention to potential positive feed backs -- among asset
    prices, investors views, new regulations and so on -- which might drive markets
    far away from a state of balance. Realistic models would seek to capture such
    processes from the outset.

  zh: 全文报告值得一读。最重要的是，它指出标准模型缺乏现实的市场动态是其主要缺陷，这些模型假设市场趋于平衡或均衡状态，并不关注可能推动市场远离平衡状态的资产价格、投资者观点、新法规等潜在正反馈。现实的模型从一开始就会寻求捕捉这样的过程。
- en: This aim of this blog is to cover and comment upon a wide range of new research
    -- much of it in physics, but some elsewhere - which is beginning to fill this
    gap. The idea is to accept that markets like most other natural systems have rich
    and complex internal dynamics. As with the weather, terrific storms can brew up
    out of blue skies through quite ordinary natural processes. If the equilibrium
    fixation of traditional economics has pushed the study of crises to one side -
    as the study of those exceptional events that occur when markets fail - the new
    perspective aims to understand how crises of many kinds emerge quite naturally
    from market processes. As any glance at history shows, they surely do, and quite
    routinely.

  zh: 本博客的目的是涵盖和评论广泛的新研究——其中很大一部分是物理学领域，但也有一些其他领域的研究——这些研究正开始填补这一空白。想法是接受市场和其他大多数自然系统一样，具有丰富和复杂的内部动态。就像天气一样，普通自然过程可能会让晴朗的天空瞬间变得狂风暴雨。如果传统经济学的均衡固定让金融危机的研究被边缘化——即市场失败时发生的那些异常事件的研究——那么新的视角旨在理解各种危机是如何自然而然地从市场过程中产生的。正如历史所显示的，它们确实如此，并且非常频繁。

    models of financial markets first developed in the mid 1990s at the Santa Fe Institute
    in New Mexico. It has come a long way since then, particularly in the past five
    years, and a growing number of economists and policy makers are beginning to take
    it very seriously. As just one example, Nature recently published
