- en: After I got married my wife and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon. There was
    a concierge in our hotel that offered all kinds of 1-day packages of things to
    do – snorkeling, trips to other Islands, etc. One thing we thought looked exciting
    was a helicopter tour of the island. She told us that the helicopters were all
    flown by former military pilots and all new and state of the art. The company
    had been flying for 15 years and never had a crash. We were looking to sign up
    for something in two days. We told her we’d talk about it and come back the next
    day to sign up.

  zh: 结婚后，我和妻子去夏威夷度蜜月。酒店里有一个礼宾部，提供各种各样的1日套餐——浮潜、去其他岛屿旅游等。我们认为很刺激的一项是岛上游直升机游览。她告诉我们，直升机前军事飞行员驾驶，所有都是全新且最先进的。公司已经运营了15年，从未发生过坠毁事故。我们打算两天后签约参加某个项目。我们告诉她我们会考虑一下，明天再来签约。

    day. We were sight-seeing the next day and figured we’d sign up in the afternoon

- en: In reality the crash had no effect on the risk of flying in the helicopter.
    Perhaps extra precautions would have been taken following the crash, but for the
    most part if the chance of crashing was around 1 in 5,000 on Friday, then after
    the crash on Saturday, the chance was still 1 in 5,000\. It wasn’t any more (as
    my wife perceived) or less (as I perceived) dangerous.

- en: Systems with perfect track records should be viewed in much the same way as
    the Hawaiian helicopters. The chance of a McClellan Oscillator signal or a CBI
    signal generating a profitable trade was never 100%. Now that they’ve encountered
    their first loss, should the risk be viewed differently? Not in my eyes. It should
    have been viewed at less than 100% before the failure and it should be viewed
    around the same after. I’ll treat breadth indicators in general and these two
    in particular in the same way I did before. Should they begin to provide false
    signals more often than expected, then it may be time to re-evaluate.

  zh: 具有完美记录的系统应被视为与夏威夷直升机类似。McClellan Oscillator 信号或 CBI 信号产生盈利交易的概率从来不是100%。现在他们遭遇了第一次亏损，应该重新评估风险吗？在我眼里，不应该。在失败之前，风险应该小于100%，在失败之后也应该大致相同。我会像以前一样对待
    breadth indicators 通用和这两个特定指标。如果它们开始提供比预期更频繁的错误信号，那么可能是时候重新评估了。
- en: Traders should attempt to use any edges they identify to their advantage. They
    should not view any edge as a guarantee, and they should not be swayed too much
    by a small sample set. It’s been almost exactly 8 years since the helicopter crash
    and I don’t believe that company has had a crash since. It’d be nice to see the
    breadth indicators put in a perfect track record for 8 more years. If they did
    it still wouldn’t change my approach.

  zh: 交易者应尝试利用他们识别出的任何优势。他们不应将任何优势视为保证，也不应过于受限于小样本集的影响。直升机坠毁事件至今已经快8年了，我不认为那家公司自那以后有过坠毁事件。如果能看到
    breadth indicators 在接下来的8年里保持完美的记录那就太好了。即便他们做到了，也不会改变我的方法。
