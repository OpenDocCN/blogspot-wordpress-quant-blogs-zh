    handling chain has a responsibility to protect traders’ identities. Still, there
    are plenty of exceptions to anonymous trading in US equities. When is it OK for
    brokers and exchanges to reveal potentially client-identifying information? In

    than those marked anonymous. This tendency is robust across stocks with different
    liquidity profiles (e.g. price, spread, volume). We’ve discussed in earlier posts
    why the supposedly efficient market has not eliminated this type of disparity.
    A gut reaction might be: “Wow, UBS is handling their customers’ orders poorly
    if they lose that much money when they trade.” I don’t know on whose behalf these
    orders are generally sent, but it’s a reasonable guess that they’re retail-type
    clients. Before you say: “typical bank, screwing over the least sophisticated
    customers,” I’d argue that UBS might be doing exactly the right thing as far as
    their clients are concerned. If these are orders from less sophisticated individuals,
    they might well be limit orders with the price chosen by the client instead of
    the broker; in which case all the client wants is to maximize their probability
    of being executed at the price submitted, without regard for what happens in the
    minutes afterward. By posting them to Nasdaq with the MPID field populated, UBS
    is essentially putting a giant “hit me” sign on these orders, which should get
    them a better fill rate, even if the rest of the market is making money off them.
    Counterintuitive as it may seem, what would be more concerning would be if these
    orders, instead of performing poorly, actually performed unusually well relative
    to the market. That would imply that their broker was leaking information to the
    market by flagging these orders with their MPID, presumably not in the customer’s

    30$/shr to mop up the quantity available. Note that the profit margins are about
