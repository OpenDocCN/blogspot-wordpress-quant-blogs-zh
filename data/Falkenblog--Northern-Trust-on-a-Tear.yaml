- en: So I was at this presentation today by the CFO of Northern Trust, a 'bank' based
    in Chicago, with about $80B in assets on its balance sheet, and about $800B in
    assets under management. You should check out their material

  zh: 今天，我参加了北方信托（Northern Trust）首席财务官（CFO）的演讲，这是一家总部位于芝加哥的“银行”，资产负债表上的资产约为800亿美元，并且管理的资产约为8000亿美元。你应该查看一下他们的资料。

- en: . This company has a current P/E of around 16, which basically means the market
    thinks a dollar of earnings here is worth about 50% more than a dollar from its
    peers. This is an example of a finance company that avoided the subprime mess,
    and really it has been the past 12 months, where they have risen 20% while the
    financial indices have fallen 25%, that has generated the separation.

  zh: 这家公司当前的市盈率大约为 16，这基本上意味着市场认为这里的一美元盈利价值比同行高出大约 50%。这就是一个避开次级债务乱局的金融公司的例子，实际上，在过去的
    12 个月中，当金融指数下跌 25% 时，他们股价上涨了 20%，这带来了这种区别。
- en: The CFO, Steve Fradkin, had several themes that I found really refreshing. First,
    he noted that if you look at JPMorgan you see that it only recently combined with
    Chase, which had just recently joined with Chemical, etc. The cumulative effects
    of all these undigested pieces makes for several problems. First, it screws up
    earnings, as special charges are created, amortized, etc., making it very difficult
    to know how you are doing, because earnings contain, or exclude, so many special
    charges, 80% of the earnings are always 'special'. Secondly, you have turf wars,
    and different cultures fighting for the soul of the company. This can really lead
    one to take one's eye off the ball.

  zh: CFO 史蒂夫·弗拉德金（Steve Fradkin）提出了几个令人耳目一新的主题。首先，他指出，如果你观察摩根大通，你会发现它只是最近才与 JPMorgan
    合并，而摩根大通最近才与切斯公司合并，等等。所有这些未消化部分的累积效应会带来一些问题。首先，它会搞乱盈利情况，因为会产生特殊费用，摊销等，使人很难知道你的业绩如何，因为盈利包含或排除了太多特殊费用，80%的盈利总是“特别的”。其次，你会面临势力斗争和不同文化争夺公司的灵魂。这确实可能使你的注意力从核心问题上移开。
- en: And 'the ball', is customers. Financial companies are in the business of intermediation,
    connecting savers to companies that need the capital. They aren't in the business
    of speculating, or arbitraging a seemingly great spread in auto ABS.

  zh: 而“核心问题”，就是客户。金融公司的业务是居间活动，将储户与需要资金的公司联系起来。他们并不是在进行投机，或者在汽车资产支持证券中套利的业务。
- en: Fradkin noted, with a nice display of corporate candor, that in the early 1990's,
    they were a standard, smaller bank, that didn't have some master plan to become
    what they became. By merely focusing on their niche, institutional clients and
    wealthy individuals, and forsaking the infinite number of other ways to make money,
    the growth took them to someplace they did not anticipate. They became one of
    the leading firms in assets under management, though you don't much hear about
    them because they don't have a retail focus.

  zh: 弗拉德金以一种很好的公司坦白的方式指出，上世纪 90 年代初，他们只是一家标准的较小银行，并没有成为他们当时所变成的东西的任何主张计划。仅仅专注于他们的利基，机构客户和富人，放弃无数其他赚钱的方法，增长带他们去了一些他们未曾预料的地方。他们成为了管理资产业务中的领军公司之一，尽管没多听说他们，因为他们没有零售业务的侧重。
- en: Fradkin also noted that when he became CFO five years ago, he visited the nasdaq,
    where his stock trades (ticker NTRS), the trading guys there said they could give
    him information on block trades, etc. What would he do with this, he asked? Good
    question. I wish I could get information on CFO visits to exchanges. Those CFOs
    that are interested in daily stock market activity would be great shorts, because
    you simply can't build a business looking at that kind of information.

  zh: 弗拉德金还指出，五年前成为首席财务官时，他访问了纳斯达克，他们公司的股票（代码 NTRS）在那里交易，交易员告诉他他们可以提供关于大宗交易等信息。他会怎么做呢？这是个好问题。我希望我能获得关于首席财务官访问交易所的信息。那些对每日股市活动感兴趣的首席财务官将会是个不错的做空目标，因为仅仅关注这种信息，是无法经营一家企业的。
- en: By sticking to one thing, understanding it, and doing it well, they have grown
    fantastically, adding a lot of shareholder value. Contrast that with CitiCorp,
    which is involved in everything, and will probably sell itself off in parts so
    that they can finally understand what business they are in.

  zh: 专注于一件事情，理解它，并做好它，他们已经取得了惊人的成长，为股东增加了很多价值。与花旗集团形成鲜明对比，他们参与各行各业，最终可能会分拆自己，以便最终理解他们所从事的业务。
