- en: 'A curious fact is that I am actually a former psychology major, and prior to
    deciding to go to business school and engage in the  requisite finance training,
    I was on track to entering a doctorate program in cognitive psychology .  Ironically
    I received cautionary advice from the business school guidance counselor about
    embarking on a finance major because: “you won’t be able to handle the math!” 
    and “finance is all about the numbers.” My decision to ignore his advice led me
    along the path to becoming a “quant.”'

  zh: 一个奇怪的事实是，我实际上是一位前心理学专业的学生，在决定去商学院接受必要的金融培训之前，我曾打算进入认知心理学的博士项目。具有讽刺意味的是，商学院辅导员曾就攻读金融专业提出警告：“你处理不了数学！”和“金融就是关于数字的。”我决定忽略他的建议，走上了成为“量化分析师”的道路。
- en: Behavioural finance giants like Kahneman and Tversky were commonplace names
    for me throughout the years, and I was quite familiar with their work. Funny my
    surprise when their work became the undoing of much is was  considered to be standard
    economic theory concerning rational agents. It is quite strange to read economic
    theories that assume that people act in a cold and rational manner when you have
    read hundreds of documented studies of people making “irrational” decisions on
    a wide variety of controlled tests. Furthermore, a person’s IQ was  not a mitigating
    or significant variable in these studies. Being a rational person myself, I began
    to realize that the assumption of rationality was designed specifically to make
    the “math” easier to solve rather than as an actual working theory.

  zh: 行为金融学巨头如卡尼曼和特沃斯基是我多年来常见的名字，我对他们的工作非常熟悉。有趣的是，当他们的工作成为许多被认为是关于理性代理的标准经济理论的失败时，我感到很惊讶。当你阅读了数百篇有关人们在各种控制测试中做出“非理性”决定的记录时，阅读假定人们以冷酷和理性的方式行事的经济理论就显得非常奇怪。此外，一个人的智商在这些研究中既不是一个缓解的变量也不是一个重要的变量。作为一个理性的人，我开始意识到，理性的假设设计得特别是为了使“数学”更容易解决，而不是作为一个实际的工作理论。
- en: You see the problem is you can’t get away from people and their biases in decision
    making. It doesn’t even matter if you are a fund that controls a billion dollars
    and uses state of the art quantitative technology. You could have the best professors
    and minds around the globe working under your roof.  Ultimately if you have a
    down period or a down year, or just an unusual period, your investors dictate
    when you buy and sell things. When they pull the plug en masse, you will be creating
    a tidal wave of  forced liquidation on your own positions that is completely independent
    of your view or quantitative outlook of the market. If your fellow quant friends
    have also been using a lot of the strategies that you have been running even to
    a small degree, they will have a lot of overlap with your positions. Your liquidation
    impacts them and other related funds, and this can cause a domino effect of client
    withdrawals. Suddenly everyone is running for the exits at one time and finally
    we have a mini-meltdown.

  zh: 问题在于你无法摆脱人们及其在决策中的偏见。即使你是一家控制数十亿美元并使用最先进的定量技术的基金。你可能拥有全球最优秀的教授和顶尖人才在你的团队中。但最终，如果你经历了一个低迷期或者一年低迷，或者只是一个异常时期，你的投资者将决定你何时买入和卖出。当他们大规模撤资时，你将对你自己的头寸进行强制性清算，而这完全独立于你对市场的看法或定量展望。如果你的量化分析师朋友也一直在运行许多你一直在运行的策略，即使只是在小范围内，他们的头寸也会与你的头寸存在大量重叠。你的清算影响了他们和其他相关基金，这可能引发客户资金的连锁提取。突然间，每个人都在一次性逃离，最终我们就会出现一次小型崩盘
- en: Why has the last two years seen such violent swings? The answer is people. 
    Fear, greed, decision regret, and depression to name a few have driven the actions
    of portfolio managers and governments over the last two years.  Both agents (fund
    managers and governments) no matter how powerful or knowledgeable ultimately answer
    to the common man with all of his/her cognitive biases. Lately people have been
    very emotional and have demanded that the government “do something!” to address
    the current crisis. Blame must be assigned and villains must be villified–history
    is replete with identical reactions to every similar situation.  Inaction and
    intelligent study or reflection after such an event is completely unacceptable
    to the public. The same phenomenon exists after a rare but inevitable plane crash
    where the public immediately demands new safety regulations. Government and fiduciary
    (fund manager) actions and  must appeal to what the people want rather than what
    is optimal. There is no getting around this, and this means that volatility will
    always produce opportunity. To the quants who look at factors, or to the traders
    that look at backtests, remember that people create contrarian or momentum opportunities.
    When you hear about mass withdrawals and bank runs, and billion dollar scandals
    you can bet that few are behaving rationally. Mean-reversion strategies do best
    in an environment of uncertainty and fear, and momentum strategies do best in
    periods of optimism and euphoria or performance chasing (like right now). At all
    the states in between the market is fairly efficient, as rationality is most likely
    to dictate decision making.

  zh: 为什么过去两年出现了如此剧烈的波动？答案在于人们。**恐惧、贪婪、决策后悔和抑郁等**因素在过去两年里驱使着投资组合经理和政府的行动。无论这两个主体（基金经理和政府）多么强大或有知识，最终都要向拥有所有认知偏见的普通人负责。近来人们非常情绪化，并要求政府“采取行动！”来应对当前的危机。责任必须被指认，恶棍必须被谴责——历史上对每个类似情况的相同反应都是司空见惯的。在此类事件之后的无所作为和智慧的研究或反思完全不被公众接受。同样的现象也存在于罕见但不可避免的飞机失事之后，公众立即要求出台新的安全法规。政府和受托人（基金经理）的行动必须迎合人们的需求，而不是最优解。这是无法避免的，这意味着波动将总是产生机会。对于看待因素的量化分析者，或者看待回测结果的交易者，要记住，人们会创造逆势或动量机会。当你听到大规模提款和银行挤兑，以及数十亿美元的丑闻时，可以肯定很少有人是理性行事的。均值回归策略在不确定和恐惧的环境中效果最佳，而动量策略在乐观、狂热或追求绩效的时期效果最佳（比如现在）。在市场各种状态之间，市场基本上是高效的，因为理性最有可能决定决策。
- en: I would argue that as long as people are responsible for making investment decisions
    whether directly or indirectly, there will always be a huge impact  of their aggregate
    bias on the market. For this simple reason—or simplifying assumption—the markets
    can never by extension be completely efficient.

  zh: 我认为只要人们负责直接或间接地做出投资决策，他们的总体偏见对市场将始终产生巨大影响。基于这个简单的理由或简化假设，市场永远也不可能完全高效。
