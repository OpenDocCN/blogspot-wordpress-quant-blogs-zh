    ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA)) has a long and storied
    history, but has been frequently overlooked in recent years.  Despite this secondary
    billing, the index is up over 30% since bottoming in January and is close to challenging
    last summer’s all-time high.

  zh: 道琼斯运输平均指数（[Dow Jones Transportation Average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Transportation_Average)
    ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA)))有着悠久而传奇的历史，但在近年来经常被忽视。尽管这种次要的地位，该指数自1月份触底以来上涨了超过30%，并接近挑战去年夏天的历史高点。
- en: The transports are often thought of as a barometer of the cyclical economy,
    frequently rising as an economy transitions from recession to recovery.  As such,
    the rise in this index has been noted by many observers as a sign of better economic
    times ahead.

  zh: 交通部门通常被认为是周期性经济的晴雨表，经常在经济从衰退过渡到复苏时上升。因此，许多人观察到这个指数的上升是经济好转的迹象。
- en: 'The reality is that the transportation index aggregates several related industries,
    including commercial airlines, shipping companies, railroads, truckers, and air
    freight firms.  These firms have had widely varying fortunes lately and the outlook
    is different from segment to segment.  One important distinction between these
    companies is their exposure to rising fuel costs.  Not surprisingly, airlines
    and truckers have been hit hard by rising energy prices.  Shippers and railroads,
    however, have suffered less of an impact.  The distinction is dramatic when drawn
    between railroads and airlines.  In the chart below, I have included not only
    the DJTA, but the Dow Jones US Railroad Index [($DJUSRR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djustr))
    and the Dow Jones US Airlines Index [($DJUSAR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djusar)).  The
    chart shows what most of us already know: the rails are booming and the airlines
    are struggling.'

  zh: 事实上，交通指数涵盖了几个相关行业，包括商业航空公司、航运公司、铁路、卡车运输商和空运公司。这些公司最近运气迥异，且每个细分市场的展望都不同。这些公司之间一个重要的区别就是它们对上升的燃料成本的暴露。不出所料，航空公司和卡车运输商受到上升能源价格的沉重打击。然而，航运公司和铁路受到的影响要小得多。在下面的图表中，我不仅包括了DJTA，还包括了道琼斯美国铁路指数[($DJUSRR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djustr))和道琼斯美国航空公司指数[($DJUSAR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djusar))。图表显示了我们大多数人都已经知道的事实：铁路正在蓬勃发展，而航空公司正在挣扎。
- en: 'Energy costs are tilting the balance of power away from airlines and truckers
    back toward the traditional bulk carriers: railroads and shipping companies.  In
    an era of rapidly expanding global trade, not only will the winners be the ones
    with a significant cost advantage, but their growing market share and growing
    markets should make for some enticing investment opportunities.'

  zh: 能源成本使权力平衡从航空公司和卡车运输商转向传统的批量运输商：铁路和航运公司。在全球贸易迅速扩张的时代，不仅成本优势显著的企业将是赢家，他们不断增长的市场份额和不断增长的市场应该会带来一些吸引人的投资机会。
