- en: Professor Fama is the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says
    financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in
    that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense,
    except in fairly trivial ways. Of course, prices reflect available information.
    But they are far from perfect. Along with like-minded colleagues and former students,
    I emphasize the enormous role played in markets by human error, as documented
    in a now-established literature called behavioral finance …

  zh: 弗ama教授是现代有效市场理论的奠基人，该理论认为金融价格有效地整合了所有可用的信息，从这个意义上讲是完美的。相比之下，我一直在争论这个理论在相当平凡的意义上几乎没有意义。当然，价格反映了可用信息。但它们远非完美。与我志同道合的同事和前学生一样，我们强调市场中人类错误扮演的巨大角色，这在行为金融学这一现已确立的文献中有所记载...

    calling it a half-truth. If the theory said nothing more than that it is unlikely
    that the average amateur investor can get rich quickly by trading in the markets
    based on publicly available information, the theory would be spot on. I personally
    believe this, and in my own investing I have avoided trading too much, and have
    a high level of skepticism about investing tips.

- en: But the theory is commonly thought, at least by enthusiasts, to imply much more.
    Notably, it has been argued that regular movements in the markets reflect a wisdom
    that transcends the best understanding of even the top professionals, and that
    it is hopeless for an ordinary mortal, even with a lifetime of work and preparation,
    to question pricing. Market prices are esteemed as if they were oracles.

  zh: 但这个理论通常被认为，至少对于狂热者来说，意味着更多。值得注意的是，有人认为市场的常规波动反映了一种超越顶级专业人士最佳理解的智慧，而且即使是普通人，即使付出了终生的工作和准备，也对定价无能为力。市场价格被看作是如同神谕般的存在。

    implications are dangerous. It is a substantial reason for the economic crisis
    we have been stuck in for the past five years, for it led authorities in the United
    States and elsewhere to be complacent about asset mispricing, about growing leverage
    in financial markets and about the instability of the global system. In fact,
    markets are not perfect, and really need regulation, much more than Professor
