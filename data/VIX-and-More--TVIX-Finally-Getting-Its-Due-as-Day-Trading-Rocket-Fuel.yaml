- en: Launched at the end of November 2010, I am surprised it has taken so long for
    [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)to become a popular short-term
    trading vehicle. I [predicted](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)
    in the middle of December that TVIX “will hit a tipping point and become the darling
    of day traders,” but in the absence of meaningful volatility during the last few
    months, it has sometimes been difficult to see the potential of TVIX.

  zh: 2008年11月底推出，我很惊讶TVIX成为受欢迎的短期交易工具花了这么长时间。我曾在12月中旬预测，TVIX“将达到临界点，成为日交易者的宠儿”，但在过去几个月中缺乏有意义的波动性，有时很难看出TVIX的潜力。
- en: With today’s sell off in stocks, however, TVIX was up as much as 18.5% at one
    point and traded a record 120,000 shares in the first half of today’s session,
    easily eclipsing its prior volume mark.

  zh: 然而，随着今天股票的抛售，TVIX一度上涨了18.5%，今天上午半场交易量达到了创纪录的12万股，轻松超过了此前的成交量。
- en: 'Shortly after Direxion launched the first [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)
    in November 2008, I came out with what sounded like an outrageous claim at the
    time: [Prediction: Direxion Triple ETFs Will Revolutionize Day Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html).
    It took awhile, but eventually these products became the preferred vehicles for
    many short-term traders. Their popularity was undercut somewhat when margin requirements
    were raised to match the leverage built into these trades. With TVIX, which is
    essentially a +2x version of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    [VIXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXY) and [VIIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIX),
    I expect that the tipping point has arrived today. With new liquidity, short-term
    traders now have a product where 10% daily moves will be relatively common and
    margin issues should be minimal.'

  zh: 在Direxion于2008年11月推出首批[三倍ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)不久后，我提出了在当时听起来有些疯狂的说法：[预测：Direxion三倍ETF将改变日交易](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html)。过了一段时间，但这些产品最终成为了许多短期交易者的首选工具。当保证金要求提高到与这些交易中内置的杠杆相匹配时，它们的受欢迎程度有所下降。TVIX基本上是[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)、[VIXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXY)和[VIIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIX)的+2x版本，我认为今天达到了临界点。有了新的流动性，短期交易者现在拥有一个产品，其中10%的日波动将相对常见，保证金问题应该最小化。

  zh: 当然，作为买入并持有工具，TVIX将带来几个重大障碍，包括由于VIX期货的期限结构/正向市场问题导致的负[滚动收益率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)，以及困扰杠杆ETF的波动性+复利损失。
