- en: When I first broached the idea of [Strangle Pong](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/strangle-pong.html)
    (a strategy of selling a front month [strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)
    in the SPX one leg at a time), I had every intention of periodically following
    up to offer comments on the strategy, how it was or was not working, and how a
    trader might manage a position like the one discussed in order to minimize risk
    while realizing a large amount of the profit potential.

  zh: 当我第一次提出[Strangle Pong](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/strangle-pong.html)（一种分批卖出SPX一个月期[strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)的策略）的想法时，我有意定期跟进，对这一策略的效果、是否成功以及交易员如何管理像文中讨论的那种头寸等问题发表评论，以实现风险最小化同时获取大部分利润潜力。
- en: In [Strangle Pong Update](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/strangle-pong-update.html),
    Mark Wolfinger ([Options for Rookies](http://blog.mdwoptions.com/options_for_rookies/))
    and I discussed the advisability of closing out the short put trade and taking
    some rather substantial profits. We agreed that keeping the position open in hopes
    of securing the final 3.65 in profit was not an attractive risk-reward play, particularly
    since the position had already earned 20.35 in profits. I concluded, however,
    that “for educational purposes I will opt to keep this an open item on the blog.”
    When I made that comment, I did not realize that an upcoming trip to Hawaii *(the
    Big Island, where everyone who has an opportunity to do so should ignore the cost
    and take the helicopter tour of Kilauea)* would keep me off the communications
    grid. What I am left with at this juncture is not the real-time analysis that
    I had hoped for, but a post-mortem. Usually I would not think a post-mortem would
    be as instructive, but in this case, I think there are quite a few lessons to
    learn.

  zh: 在[Strangle Pong Update](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/strangle-pong-update.html)中，Mark
    Wolfinger ([Options for Rookies](http://blog.mdwoptions.com/options_for_rookies/))和我讨论了平仓空头看跌交易并获取相当可观的利润的建议。我们同意，为了确保最后3.65的利润而保持头寸开放并不是一个吸引人的风险回报玩法，尤其是因为该头寸已经赚取了20.35的利润。然而，我得出结论，“出于教育目的，我将在博客上保持这个开放项。”当我发表这个评论时，我没有意识到即将到来的前往夏威夷的旅行*（去大岛，每个人都应该忽略成本，乘坐直升机游览基拉韦厄火山）*
    将使我脱离通信网络。此时我剩下的不是我希望的实时分析，而是一个事后分析。通常我认为事后分析不会那么有教益，但在这个案例中，我认为有很多教训可以学习。
- en: For starters, while it turns out that my original rationale for the trade was
    rewarded at [expiration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration),
    the risks along the way did not warrant holding through expiration, at least for
    me. This is an important point for beginning options traders, who have a tendency
    to hold their winning and losing options trades through expiration, usually resulting
    in winning trades giving back some of their earlier profits and all too often
    losing trades expiring worthless.

  zh: 起初，虽然我的原始交易逻辑在[到期](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration)时得到了回报，但途中的风险并不值得持有至到期，至少对我来说是这样。这是对初学者期权交易员的一个重要观点，他们倾向于将盈亏的期权交易持有至到期，通常导致盈利的交易回吐部分早期利润，而过于频繁的是，亏损的交易到期一文不值。
- en: To recap, the idea behind the short strangle was to capitalize on the possibility
    of range-bound trading in the SPX in the 1040-1100 area during the last 16 days
    of the expiration cycle. The objective was to leg into the trade based on which
    end of the range the SPX was trading. The first leg was a short November SPX 1040
    put that immediately went in the wrong direction. As the table below shows, the
    SPX broke 1040 and closed at 1036 and change (red shading) on the day the trade
    was initiated. With a maximum gain of 24 points, the trade was already a 5.45
    point loss at the end of the first day. More importantly, a critical part of the
    trade thesis – that 1040 would provide support – was no longer valid. The bottom
    line is that there was very good reason to cut losses on day one and close out
    the trade.

  zh: 回顾一下，短线跨式策略背后的想法是利用标普500指数在到期周期最后16天内1040-1100点区间震荡交易的可能性。目标是根据标普500指数在区间的哪一端交易来逐步进入该交易。第一阶段是一份立即走势错误的11月标普500指数1040点看跌期权。如下表所示，交易启动当天标普500指数突破1040点，收盘于1036点附近（红色阴影）。最大收益24点，第一天结束时交易已经亏损5.45点。更重要的是，交易论点中的关键部分——1040点将提供支撑——已经不再有效。底线是，有充分的理由在第一天止损并平仓。
- en: As it turns out, my market timing signals earned their keep the next day as
    buyers jumped in, with support coming in the 1029-1030 area and the SPX beginning
    an almost uninterrupted bullish run for the next 13 trading days. After 5-6 days,
    the SPX had recovered to the middle of the target 1040-1100 trading range (blue
    shading) and two thirds of the potential profit had already been realized.

  zh: 结果证明，我的市场时机制信号在第二天就证明了其价值，买家涌入，支撑位在1029-1030点区间，标普500指数开始了接下来13个交易日的几乎无间断的上涨行情。5-6天后，标普500指数已经恢复到目标1040-1100点交易范围的中部（蓝色阴影），潜在利润的六分之三已经实现。
- en: The week prior to expiration saw the SPX take a run at 1100 and just fall short.
    During that week, the 1040 puts fell all the way down to 1.40, while the November
    1100 calls moved up in price on Monday and Wednesday (bold blue type). The short
    1100 call position that Mark and I discarded as too risky on Monday at 8.40 would
    have been a loser from Monday through Thursday. While the short 1100 call eventually
    became profitable on Friday, the following week the SPX broke out over 1100 and
    closed near 1110 on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, with the calls still unprofitable
    and threatening to incur larger losses.

  zh: 在到期前的一周，标普500指数（SPX）尝试冲击1100点但未能成功。那一周，1040点的看跌期权一路下跌至1.40美元，而11月1100点的看涨期权在周一和周三的价格有所上升（粗体蓝色）。马克和我周一在8.40美元时认为风险过高而放弃的1100点看跌期权空头位置，从周一到周四都会是亏损的。尽管最终在周五该看跌期权变得有盈利，但随后的一周，标普500指数突破1100点，周一、周二和周三收盘价接近1110点，看涨期权仍然亏损，并存在更大亏损的风险。
- en: Getting back to the original rationale for the trade, once the SPX closed above
    1100 on Monday, upside resistance was broken and the risk was too high for a relatively
    small reward. At that stage – and with only four days remaining prior to expiration,
    I would have closed the trade at a loss of 3.20.

  zh: 回到交易的原始论据，一旦标普500指数周一收盘价超过1100点，上方阻力被突破，相对较小的回报风险过高。在那个阶段——并且到期前只剩下四天，我会以3.20点的亏损平仓。
- en: So to recap, while this looks like a perfect short strangle on paper, with both
    the short put and the short call expiring worthless, prudent risk management would
    not have resulted in holding the trade until expiration. Further, not only would
    the profits on the short put have been taken early (netting 20.35 out of a possible
    24.00), but if the short call leg had been initiated (and I thought this was a
    questionable trade at the time of the Strangle Pong Update), I would certainly
    have cut my losses (-3.20) before giving the trade a chance to make a profit.

  zh: 所以回顾一下，尽管这在纸面上看起来是一个完美的短线跨式策略，看跌和看涨期权都到期无价值，谨慎的风险管理不会导致持有交易至到期。此外，不仅看跌期权的利润会提前实现（从可能的24.00点中净得20.35点），而且如果启动看涨期权空头（我当时认为这是一个有问题的交易，在跨式策略更新时），我肯定会止损（亏损3.20点），而不是给交易机会盈利。
- en: The bottom line is that this was a great trade on paper, but with proper risk
    management, is was merely a very good trade in terms of profits, netting only
    about 60% of what would have been earned if the strangle had been held to expiration.
    Over the long run, however, I maintain that understanding the risk-reward profiles
    of existing options positions is more important than trying to extract the maximum
    profit from each options trade.

  zh: 底线是，这笔交易在纸面上看起来很不错，但由于适当的风险管理，其实只算是一个非常好的交易，利润净额只有如果持有到期的话应该获得的60%。然而，从长远来看，我坚持认为理解现有期权头寸的风险回报概况比试图从每一笔期权交易中提取最大利润更为重要。
