- en: An AAA security basically never defaults. historically, the default rates were,
    oh, 0.03% annualized, so small, a single default would double it. The AAA-BBB
    spread was abnormally high, but mainly because AAA was treated like US Treasuries,
    which, historically, was accurate. But that was in the past. Now, AAA means something
    totally different to investors.

  zh: AAA安全基本上不会违约。历史上，违约率大约是0.03%年化，如此之小，一个违约就会使其翻倍。 AAA-BBB利差异常高，但主要是因为AAA被像美国国债一样对待，这在历史上是准确的。但那是过去的事了。现在，AAA对投资者意味着完全不同的东西。
- en: I was talking to someone who works in Commercial Real Estate, and he said they
    are pretty screwed right now because the AAA rated tranches on deals price at
    around 400 basis points above Libor. He noted these have never, ever, defaulted.
    But then, neither did Residential AAA tranches prior to 2007\. It seems the Agencies
    have lost a lot of credibility, and this is going to cause some major problems
    for a long time, which is a shame because done correctly, these AAA tranches are
    bullet proof. Unfortunately, these deals have lots of details, so lots of room
    for errors and bad assumptions. In these cases, eventually you must trust the
    rating agency, or the issuer, which buyers do not do anymore. This is in contrast
    to trusting them completely, even as they were asleep at the wheel while underwriters
    changed the standards of the pools they were rating. So it is quite a change.

  zh: 我曾和一位从事商业房地产的人交谈，他说他们现在非常困扰，因为交易上的AAA评级等级价格约为Libor基础点的400个。他指出这些从未违约。但在2007年之前，住宅AAA评级等级也是如此。看起来机构失去了很多信誉，这将导致长期的重大问题，这很可惜，因为正确执行，这些AAA评级等级是防弹的。不幸的是，这些交易有很多细节，因此存在很多错误和错误的假设的空间。在这些情况下，最终你必须信任评级机构或发行人，而买家不再这样做。这与完全信任它们完全不同，即使它们在承销商改变了它们评级的资产池的标准时都在熟睡。所以这是一个相当大的变化。
- en: Another issue is that many Asset Backed Securities have had little increase
    in underlying defaults, but as their spreads have widened during this crisis,
    this has heightened sensitivity to the mark-to-marked risk over and above any
    concerns about underlying credit quality.

  zh: 另一个问题是，许多资产支持证券的基础违约情况几乎没有增加，但是由于这次危机期间它们的利差扩大，这加剧了对标记-市场风险的敏感性，超过了对基础信用质量的任何担忧。
- en: It seems there is a great opportunity for those really knowledgeable to invest
    in these areas. that is, relying on the rating is now over, but there are ways
    to analyze these things, and, basically the stupid underwriting practices from
    2006 are not inevitable(no income verification, no equity by the asset holder,
    assuming the collateral would increase regardless).

  zh: 看起来对于那些真正了解的人来说，投资这些领域是一个很好的机会。也就是说，现在依靠评级已经结束了，但有方法来分析这些事情，基本上从2006年开始的愚蠢承销做法不是不可避免的（没有收入验证，没有资产持有人的股权，假设抵押品会增加）。
