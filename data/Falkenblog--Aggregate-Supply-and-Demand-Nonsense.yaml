- en: One characteristic of Keynesian thinking is to think the problem currently is
    with inadequate Aggregate Demand, as if this is some simple analytical construct
    that is just as meaningful as the demand for apples. This is nonsense. Aggregate
    Demand and Aggregate Supply are incoherent constructs that require heroic assumptions.
    You might as well talk about the current law of motion on the Hegelian Dialectic,
    which for decades was discussed as if it were real. Things exist before people
    know they exist (eg, nations, atoms), and things also don't exist even when many
    are certain they do (eg, anthropomorphic God, aether, phlogiston). About what
    one can not speak, one should remain silent, and you can't talk about something
    that is as logically vacuous as aggregate supply and demand.

  zh: 凯恩斯思维的一个特征是认为当前的问题在于不足的总需求，就像这是一些简单的分析构造，就像对苹果的需求一样有意义。这是荒谬的。总需求和总供给是不连贯的构造，需要英雄般的假设。你可能会谈论黑格尔辩证法的当前运动定律，几十年来它被认为是真实的。事物在人们知道它们存在之前就存在（例如，国家、原子），而事物也在许多人确信它们存在时不存在（例如，拟人化的上帝、以太、燃素）。对于一个人无法言说的事物，他应该保持沉默，你不能谈论一些逻辑上空洞的东西，比如总供给和总需求。

- en: In partial equilibrium, a good exists and its price represents its output relative
    to innumerable other consumer wants. This is why the demand curve slopes downward,
    because the more it costs, the more you have to forgo of other stuff. Demand curves
    are driven by consumer utility (which decreases as one consumes more of a specific
    good), and income (which shifts it about). For supply curves, the correlate to
    utility curves are cost curves. One generally produces where marginal cost equals
    price, and so marginal cost is increasing (if it were decreasing, you could increase
    supply and lower costs for a 'given' price). Thus, you only raise your output
    if the price rises.

  zh: 在偏微观经济学中，存在一种商品，其价格代表了相对于其他无数消费者需求的产出。这就是为什么需求曲线向下倾斜，因为成本越高，你就必须放弃其他东西。需求曲线受消费者效用（随着特定商品消费量的增加而减少）和收入（将其推移）的影响。对于供应曲线，与效用曲线相关的是成本曲线。通常情况下，在边际成本等于价格的地方生产，因此边际成本是增加的（如果它减少，你可以增加供应并降低“给定”价格的成本）。因此，只有在价格上涨时才会增加产量。
- en: You can assume demand and supply move separately, as when seasonal harvests
    of perishable goods arise in supply, or demand for cranberries increases before
    Thanksgiving. The logic of supply and demand curves in markets is firmly based
    on utility and cost functions, and is a very useful way to think about things.

- en: Now consider Aggregate Demand. Here the 'price' on the vertical axis is not
    a relative price, but rather an absolute price level, which by itself is meaningless.
    If there was only one good in any economy people cared about, what would its 'price'
    even mean? So, right off the bat, something's fishy. Supposedly, in normal times
    the AD curve slopes down, we think, because other things equal a higher price
    level increases the demand for money, which drives up interest rates, which reduces
    investment and spending. But how does one increase the price level and leave 'other
    things equal?' One can imagine doing this in partial equilibrium, but it's a strange
    thing to contemplate over all goods. Further, at interest rate levels like today,
    it's not as if lowering interest rates is having any effect on investment (the
    liquidity trap, which is occurs always in real time for Keynesians, who always
    say this is why government spending is necessary now).

  zh: 现在考虑总需求。这里垂直轴上的“价格”不是相对价格，而是绝对价格水平，单独看没有任何意义。如果任何经济体中只有一种人们关心的商品，那么它的“价格”意味着什么？所以，一开始就有些可疑。据说，在正常时期，总需求曲线向下倾斜，我们认为是因为其他条件相等时，较高的价格水平会增加对货币的需求，从而推高利率，降低投资和支出。但是如何增加价格水平而又保持“其他条件相等”呢？可以想象在局部均衡中这样做，但在所有商品上考虑这一点是一件奇怪的事情。此外，在像今天这样的利率水平下，降低利率并没有对投资产生任何影响（流动性陷阱，在凯恩斯学派看来，这在实时中总是发生，他们总是说这就是为什么现在需要政府支出的原因）。
- en: 'Then there''s the ''Pigou''s wealth effect'', which affects wealth by changing
    people''s real balances, because presumably their cash levels are constant but
    magically prices move, affecting real wealth, CashValue/Price. However, offsetting
    that is the ''Fisher real balance effect'', where one''s debts change in real
    value. These debt effects are generally thought of as more important, and why
    most macroeconomists believe a little inflation would be good right now, and perhaps
    always: it reduces the legacy debt in real terms.'

  zh: Pigou的财富效应影响着人们的真实资产，因为假设他们的现金水平保持不变，但神奇的是价格在变动，影响着真实财富，CashValue/Price。然而，抵消这一效应的是Fisher的实际资产效应，即债务的实际价值发生变化。一般认为这些债务效应更为重要，这也是为什么大多数宏观经济学家认为现在（也许永远）通货膨胀会有好处：它以实际价值减少的方式减轻了历史债务的负担。
- en: Lastly there are Mundell-Fleming effects, which operate though capital inflows
    caused by changes in real rates from changing the price level. Supposedly lower
    interest rates lead to capital account deficit, which a trade surplus, which implies
    higher GDP. The data on this are mixed, but generally international trade is the
    tail, not the dog, for large countries like the USA.

  zh: 最后还有蒙代尔-弗莱明效应，通过由于价格水平变化而导致的实际利率变化引起的资本流入作用。据说降低利率会导致资本账户逆差，进而产生贸易顺差，这意味着GDP增加。对此的数据是混合的，但一般来说，国际贸易只是大国的尾巴，而不是大国的主导因素，比如美国。
- en: Now consider aggregate supply, which classically is horizontal, and then in
