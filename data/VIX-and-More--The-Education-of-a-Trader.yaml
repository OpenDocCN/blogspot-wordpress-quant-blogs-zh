- en: Do you remember from your school days those students who when confronted with
    a complex issue, would acquire a look on their faces somewhere between consternation
    and dread, immediately thrust a waving hand up into the air and blurt out in a
    worried voice, “Do we have to know this for the test?” I can be fairly sure that
    none of these people ended up as successful traders.

  zh: 你是否记得在学校的日子里，那些面对复杂问题时，脸上露出困惑和恐惧的表情，立刻高举着手向空中挥舞，并用担忧的声音急切地问：“我们要知道这个内容参加考试吗？”我可以相当肯定，这些人都没成为成功的交易员。
- en: One only has to look at the history of hiring patterns at Wall Street firms
    to get a sense of the evolution of thinking about how to develop a successful
    trader. For many years, the model for aspiring traders was considered to be a
    genteel Ivy League education. Over time, Wall Street firms began to favor graduates
    with a more humble socioeconomic pedigree who were considered hungry, hard working
    and highly motivated to prove something to the world. In more recent years, we
    have seen Wall Street seek out physicists and those with exceptional quantitative
    skills. Lately, a desire for poker skills has also come into play.

  zh: 只需看看华尔街公司雇佣模式的历史，就能了解到关于如何培养成功交易员思维的演变。多年来，有志于成为交易员的人的模式被认为是接受一所优雅的常春藤盟校的教育。随着时间的推移，华尔街公司开始青睐那些社会经济背景更为普通、被视为渴望、勤奋并且有强烈动力向全世界证明自己的人。在最近几年，我们看到了华尔街在寻找物理学家和那些具有杰出量化技能的人。最近，对扑克技能的渴望也开始发挥作用。
- en: As I see it, all traders are ultimately self-taught. There are no required classes,
    readings, homework assignments or even a syllabus with recommendations. Tests
    are administered on a daily basis, frequently with multiple tests on the same
    day. Worst of all, everyone is graded on an unfavorable curve in which there are
    more Fs than As.

  zh: 在我看来，所有交易员最终都是自学成才的。没有必修课、阅读材料、家庭作业 assignment 甚至推荐的教学大纲。测试每天进行，经常在同一天进行多项测试。最糟糕的是，每个人都按照不利的曲线进行评分，其中F的成绩比A的成绩多。
- en: Against this backdrop, education counts, but skill and experience count even
    more. An insatiable curiosity helps, as does a willingness to explore unfamiliar
    territory. Great trades, insights and strategies present themselves in somewhat
    random fashion and, as Louis Pasteur observed, “Chance favors the prepared mind.”

  zh: 在这种背景下，教育很重要，但技能和经验更重要。无法满足的好奇心有助于探索未知领域。伟大的交易、见解和策略以某种随机的方式出现，正如路易·巴斯德观察到的，“机会青睐有准备的大脑。”
- en: But what kind of preparation is ideal? Malcolm Gladwell asserts that 10,000
    hours of experience is a prerequisite for greatness in almost any field. In a
    normal career, that level of commitment usually translates to five years, but
    on Wall Street, 10,000 hours of experience can be crammed into 3–4 years. Of course,
    all hours are not created equal. A trader’s capacity to distinguish between random
    events and meaningful patterns is important to establish a solid trajectory of
    growth and development.

  zh: 但是理想的准备方式是什么？马尔科姆·格拉德威尔断言，在任何领域取得伟大成就之前，都需要10,000个小时的经验。在正常职业生涯中，这种程度的投入通常需要五年，但在华尔街，10,000个小时的经验可以在3-4年内积累。当然，不是所有的时间都是平等的。交易员区分随机事件和有意义模式的能力对于建立坚实的成长和发展轨迹非常重要。
- en: For my personal education process, unlearning was more important than learning.
    My formal schooling consisted of an undergraduate degree in political science
    and a traditional MBA program. After two decades of business strategy consulting
    experience deeply rooted in fundamental analysis, I was ill-equipped to excel
    in a short-term trading time frame. In order to embrace technical analysis, I
    first had to jettison my fundamental perspective on investments and build a new
    foundation based on technical analysis and market sentiment.

  zh: 在我的个人教育过程中， unlearning比learning更重要。我的正规教育包括政治学本科学位和传统的MBA项目。在二十年的以基本分析为基础的商业战略咨询经验之后，我在短期交易框架内表现不佳。为了接受技术分析，我首先必须抛弃我对投资的
    fundamental perspective，并建立一个新的基于技术分析和市场情绪的基础。
- en: In my opinion, the best way to approach trading is to consider the educational
    process to be a lifelong endeavor, crossing as many multi-disciplinary boundaries
    as can be digested. In a way, I like to think of the foundation of trading success
    as building a large idea stew and developing an eye for spotting high potential
    new ideas. The trick is to have the right breadth and depth of knowledge so that
    when one stumbles on the next great strategy, it can be easily identified, captured
    and developed. Call it opportunistic research and development, if you will.

  zh: 在我看来，交易的最佳方法是考虑教育过程为终身事业，跨越尽可能多的跨学科领域。某种程度上，我喜欢把交易成功的基石想象为建立一大锅思想炖菜，并培养发现高潜力新想法的眼光。诀窍是拥有正确的知识广度和深度，这样当遇到下一个伟大策略时，它可以很容易地被识别、捕捉和开发。如果你愿意，可以称之为机会研究和发展。
- en: As luck would have it, some of the most successful trading strategies I employ
    are based on areas in which I had limited knowledge when I first encountered them.
    No matter how well things are going, I take the approach that I never have the
    luxury of being satisfied with the status quo and need to embrace the idea of
    getting out of my comfort zone. In trading and in life, it pays to constantly
    refresh the pipeline of new ideas and continue to tinker with them, because you
    never know what will be on tomorrow’s test.

  zh: 运气好的是，我使用的某些最成功的交易策略是基于我最初遇到时知识有限的领域。无论事情进行得多么顺利，我都采取这样的态度：我永远不能满足于现状，需要接受走出舒适区的想法。在交易和生活中，不断更新新想法的渠道并继续调整它们是值得的，因为你永远不知道明天的考试会有什么。
