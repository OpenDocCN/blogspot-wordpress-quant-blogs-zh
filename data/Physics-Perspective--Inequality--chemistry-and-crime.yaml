    such a link has been established rather convincingly by statistical analyses across

    that deserve some discussion. One is an idea in criminology known as "routine
    activity theory" which has increasingly become a branch of applied computational
    social science. In effect, it views crime as a kind of natural social chemistry
    taking place between potential offenders and targets, and has a good track record
    in accounting for empirical patterns of crimes of all kinds by considering simple
    factors such as patterns of human movement on streets, of street lighting, of
    building architecture and so on. It more or less gives up on thinking about the
    deep psychology of crime and its motivation. In general, this perspective asserts,
    you tend to get more crime where you have more targets coming together more frequently
    with more potential offenders, just as you get more chemical reactions whenever
    potential reactant molecules come into contact more frequently. I've written about
    this a little before in

  zh: 但在我的专栏中，我还提到了另外两条值得讨论的研究线索。一个是犯罪学中的一个想法，称为“例行活动理论”，它越来越多地成为应用计算社会科学的一个分支。从本质上讲，它将犯罪视为一种发生在潜在违法者和目标之间的自然社会化学。通过考虑简单因素（如街道上的人流模式、街道照明、建筑风格等），它对各种犯罪的实证模式有较好的解释记录。这种观点基本上放弃了深入思考犯罪及其动机的深层心理学。总的来说，这种观点认为，您通常会在更多的目标更频繁地与更多的潜在违法者相遇的地方遇到更多的犯罪，正如潜在反应分子更频繁地接触时，您会得到更多的化学反应。我以前在

    give a person the motivation to commit crime in the first place. Here the analogy
    to chemistry is again constructive, I think. In chemistry, reactants coming together
    isn't enough. They generally need sufficient energy (or a catalyst) to help them
    overcome an energy barrier (caused by repulsive forces between molecules) before
    they can react. It's entirely plausible to think of prevailing social norms as
    a kind of energy barrier to the commission of crimes, as these forces tend to
    persuade people to avoid crime. In general, we should expect high levels of trust
    and strong social norms to suppress and discourage crime, much as a lowering the
    temperature of a chemical solution makes reactions go more slowly. (Low temperature
    increases the effective size of energy barriers to reaction, which must be overcome
    by collisions between molecules; these are stronger at higher temperatures.)

  zh: 对于潜在的目标，它并不试图探索可能给予一个人犯罪动机的因素。在这里，我认为化学的类比是有建设性的。在化学中，反应物之间的简单结合是不够的。通常，它们需要足够的能量（或催化剂）来帮助它们克服分子间斥力引起的能量障碍，然后才能发生反应。将主导的社会规范视为一种对犯罪起到能量障碍作用的东西是完全合理的，因为这些力量倾向于说服人们避免犯罪。总的来说，我们应该期待高度的信任和强大的社会规范能够抑制和

- en: Analogies aside, the point is that routine activity theory actually fits together
    quite well with the existence of larger social factors that influence overall
    probabilities of crime. The factors considered in the theory can determine detailed
    patterns of crime, even as the larger global factors influence overall rates.
    The work considered by Wilkinson and Pickett strongly suggests that social inequality
    is one of the most important global factors encouraging crime (and other measures
    of social dysfunction).

- en: from several years ago by Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mezard analyses a
    very simple model of an economy and shows that a high level of economic inequality
    is a more or less generic and unavoidable outcome. It is something to be expected
    on mathematical grounds alone. The basic idea is to model an economy as a system
    in which wealth flows around among people by two fundamentally different processes.
    First, it flows between individuals when they make exchanges or trades, through
    contracts, employment, sales and so on. Second, wealth also accrues to individuals
    (or departs from them) on account of investments in instruments yielding uncertain
    returns. Importantly, the second factor contributes an element to individual wealth
    that involves a random multiplicative factor -- random because investments are
    uncertain, and multiplicative because, quite sensibly, the wealthier invest more
    than the poorer, and typically more in direct proportion to their wealth. The
    poor partake very weakly in this multiplicative channel to wealth growth, while
    the wealthy participate progressively more strongly.

  zh: 几年前由 Jean-Philippe Bouchaud 和 Marc Mezard 所做的一项分析，研究了一个非常简单的经济模型，并表明高度的经济不平等是一个相对普遍且不可避免的结果。仅从数学角度来看，这也是可以预料的。基本思想是将对经济的一种建模，作为一种财富在人们之间通过两种根本不同的过程流动的系统。首先，当他们在进行交易或贸易（通过合同、就业、销售等）时，财富在个体之间流动。其次，由于对产生不确定回报的金融工具的投资，财富也会流向个体（或从他们那里流失）。重要的是，第二个因素为个人财富贡献了一个涉及随机乘法因素的元素——随机是因为投资是不确定的，乘法是因为，合情合理的是，越富有的人投资越多，而且通常他们的投资直接与其财富成比例。贫困人群在这个财富增长乘法渠道中参与度非常低，而富裕人群的参与度逐渐增强。
- en: Bouchaud and Mezard showed that the inevitable outcome in such a basic system
    is that a large fraction of the total wealth in the economy ends up being held
    by a small faction of the population. This is the case even if every individual
    is considered to have the same inherent money making skills. (The authors, of
    course, do not believe this to be the case; but making this assumption makes it
    possible to explore how natural economic dynamics can drive large wealth disparities
    even in the absence of any differences in skill.) It's the multiplicative nature
    of the returns on investments that makes it happen. This pattern in the distribution
    of wealth holds in every nation and was known long ago, being first described
    by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. This paper gave to my knowledge the first
    really fundamental explanation of why this pattern holds everywhere. Since then
    a number of works have taken this approach much further.

  zh: 布ouchaud 和 Mezard 表明，在这样一个基本系统中，不可避免的结局是经济中大部分总财富最终会被人口中的一个小部分所持有。即使假设每个个体都有相同的内在赚钱能力，这种情况也会发生。（当然，作者并不相信这种情况；但做出这个假设使人们能够探索自然经济动力如何在没有任何技能差异的情况下导致巨大的财富差距。）这是投资回报的乘法特性所导致的。这种财富分布的模式在每一个国家都存在，并且很久以前就已经被意大利经济学家维弗雷多·帕累托首次描述。这篇论文据我所知第一次提供了这个模式为何无处不在的真正基本解释。从那时起，许多作品已经采用了这种方法并将其发扬光大。
- en: However, the universal form of this distribution does not preclude the possibility
    of some societies being more unequal than others. You can have a society in which
    the top 5% hold 90% of the wealth, or in which that same top 5% holds 99.9% of
    the wealth. Such variations are driven by the relative strength of multiplicative
    returns on investment versus the flows in an economy that might act to reduce
    inequality. Obviously, taxation is one mechanism that leads to a redistribution
    of wealth from richer to poorer and one should expect, in a broad brush way, that
    lower taxes should tend to associate with higher levels of wealth inequality.

  zh: 然而，这种分布的普遍形式并不排除某些社会可能比其他社会更加不平等的可能性。你可以有一个社会，其中最富有的5%持有90%的财富，或者其中同一个最富有的5%持有99.9%的财富。这种变化是由投资回报的乘法特性与可能减少不平等的经济流动之间的相对强度所驱动的。显然，税收是一种使财富从富有者重新分配到贫穷者的机制，因此可以预料，在广义上，较低的税收应该与较高的财富不平等水平相关。
- en: I strongly recommend this paper -- it's short and you can skip over some of
    the mathematical detail -- as it shows how some very important global economic
    realities may have quite simple underlying causes. The bigger problem, of course,
    is learning then how to craft real world policies so as to keep inequality within
    bounds, avoiding the many kinds of social dysfunction it clearly seems to give
