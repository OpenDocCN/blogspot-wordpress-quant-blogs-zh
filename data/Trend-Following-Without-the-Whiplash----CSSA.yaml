    but surprisingly little if no recent research has focused on the opposite approach:
     attempting to follow the trend with less whiplash. What does that mean? Well
    anyone who has had the experience of trying to follow a trend typically has to
    endure the pain of buying their position and having to soon after exit the position
    at a lower price. Trend followers also experience being profitable for long periods
    of time, only to have the position suddenly and violently reverse and hand them
    a tidy loss.  Ironically one of the funny things that happens after such an event
    is that the market often bounces considerably higher in the short-term. The obvious
    solution to these problems is to create a counter-trend  delayed entry and exit
    using short-term mean-reversion indicators. However what is missing from this
    proposed solution is a generalized framework for determining how and when to use
    such methods. More on this to follow……….'

  zh: 许多研究已经发表了关于将均值回归与趋势过滤器结合的研究，但令人惊讶的是，很少有近期研究关注相反的方法：尝试以较少的波动跟随趋势。这意味着什么？嗯，任何有过跟随趋势经验的人通常都必须忍受购买头寸后很快以更低的价格退出头寸的痛苦。趋势跟随者也经常经历长时间盈利，然后突然间剧烈反转，给他们带来一笔不小的损失。讽刺的是，在这种事件之后发生的一件有趣的事情是，市场在短期内通常会反弹得相当高。解决这些问题的明显方法是使用短期均值回归指标创建一个逆趋势的延迟进入和退出。然而，这个
    proposed solution 中缺少的是一个确定如何和使用这种方法的通用框架。关于这一点，接下来会有更多内容……．．．．．．
