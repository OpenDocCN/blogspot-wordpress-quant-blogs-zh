  zh: 或者规则的其他一些变化，她运用了一种更为微妙的办法来分析经济。首先，她认为兼职工作者想要全职工作的数量是衡量经济疲软程度的一个指标：
- en: For example, the seven million people who are working part time but would like
    a full-time job. ***This number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent
    unemployment, based on past experience***, and the existence of such a large pool
    of "partly unemployed" workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than
    indicated by the unemployment rate. Statistics on job turnover also point to considerable
    slack in the labor market.

  zh: 例如，七百万人正在兼职工作，但希望有全职工作。**这个数字远远超过了我们根据过去的经验预期的6.7%的失业率**，这样一个庞大的“部分失业”工人群体的存在，是劳动力条件比失业率所显示的要糟糕的迹象。就业流动统计数据也显示劳动力市场存在相当大的松弛。
- en: 'Yellen then went on to point to the lack of wage pressure as another indication
    of economic slack:'
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 耶伦接着指出，工资压力不足是经济疲软的另一个迹象：
- en: A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has
    not helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries. Workers in a slack market
    have little leverage to demand raises. ***Labor compensation has increased an
    average of only a little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which
    is very low by historical standards.***
  id: totrans-26

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 松弛的第二个证据是，失业率的下降并没有像过去复苏那样帮助提高工人的工资。在疲软的市场中，工人几乎没有谈判加薪的筹码。**自经济衰退以来，劳动补偿平均每年仅增长2%左右，这在历史标准中是非常低的。**
- en: 'She also referred to the plight of the long-term unemployed worker and noted
    that they appeared to be not very different from everyone else. Since the long-term
    unemployed find it very difficult to find a job, they could create real headwinds
    for the growth outlook:'
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 她还提到了长期失业工人的困境，并指出他们似乎与他人并没有太大不同。由于长期失业者很难找到工作，他们可能会对增长前景产生真正的逆风：
- en: A third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the
    extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six
    months or more. ***These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular
    work, and they appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to
    find a job.*** The concern is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the
    sidelines, ultimately dropping out of the workforce. But ***the data suggest that
    the long-term unemployed look basically the same as other unemployed people in
    terms of their occupations, educational attainment, and other characteristics.***
    And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the short-term jobless
    do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally improved
    for both groups. That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-term
    unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term
    unemployed. This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term
    unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.

  zh: 第三种与松弛相关的证据涉及失业者中失业六个月或更长时间的异常大比例的特征。**这些工人发现很难找到稳定的、规律的工作，并且他们在找工作时似乎处于极其不利的竞争地位。**
    担忧的是，长期失业者可能会最终被边缘化，最终退出劳动力市场。但**数据显示，长期失业者在职业、教育成就和其他特征上与其他失业者基本上没有区别。** 而且，尽管他们找到工作的频率低于短期失业者，但寻找工作的求职者的就业率也只有微弱改善。也就是说，我们还没有看到短期失业者相对于长期失业者找到工作越来越容易的明确迹象。这个事实让我有希望，长期失业者中将有相当一部分最终能从更强的劳动力市场中受益。

  zh: 最后，她强调了参与率下降如何扭曲失业率，这可能会使埃文斯法则失效：
- en: A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior
    of the participation rate–the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are
    seeking jobs. Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a
    job give up trying to find one. When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age
    population was part of the labor force. Participation dropped, as it normally
    does in a recession, but then kept dropping in the recovery. It now stands at
    63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a much smaller share of women were
    in the workforce. ***Lower participation could mean that the 6.7 percent unemployment
    rate is overstating the progress in the labor market.***

  zh: 劳动力市场松弛的最后证据之一是参与率的行为——即工作年龄成年人持有或寻求工作的比例。在疲软的就业市场中，当想要工作的人放弃寻找工作时，参与率会下降。经济衰退开始时，66%的工作年龄人口属于劳动力队伍。参与率下降了，正如在经济衰退中通常会发生的那样，但在复苏过程中继续下降。现在它
    stands at 63%，与1978年相同，当时工作妇女的比例要小得多。**参与率的下降意味着6.7%的失业率可能高估了劳动力市场的进展。**
