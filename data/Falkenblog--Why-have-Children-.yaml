    things a grandparent does for a child is often looked back at with profound appreciation.

    remembers throwing a tantrum about not wanting to go to school. His frail 80 year
    old grandfather, the American President John Quincy Adams (son of President and
    Founding Father John Adams), appears, and takes his hand, and walked him silently
    a mile to the schoolhouse. No lecture, just a walk, but right to school, and the
    tantrum was over. Looking back, Henry Adams notes that “the seeds of a moral education
    would at that moment have fallen on the stoniest soil in Quincy”. These are the
    things parents and grandparents strive for, hoping that when they are long gone
    a consciousness truly appreciates something they have done in a profound way.'

- en: An executive has a full inbox of people competing for your attention all the
    time, and does not need children to manufacture appreciation, and so as children
    are substitutes for generating appreciation, and resources are limited, many career-oriented
    women are childless by choice. I think children are great investment in creating
    something that needs you, that connects you to the future. Not only do toddlers
    need you, but so will their kids, which is especially rewarding during a period
    in one's life when your professional duties create no need for you. For the poor
    with no market skills, kids are a sure way to make yourself important, at least
    in someone's eyes.

- en: The flip side of being appreciated, is being unappreciated, and no tiresome
    work or physical pain is as stressful is being in a situation where you feel your
    talents are unappreciated, and you see little hope of changing things. The null
    feeling of people towards each other is indifference, and so a person unappreciated
    by everyone has done nothing to earn favor, and knows it. What makes this so terrible
    is that unappreciation is persistent, whereas physical pain is temporary. When
    I think about making my children successful, it primarily involves imagining them
    in a situation where they are appreciated because of their competence, courage,
    empathy, and good humor. If all I knew was that many people truly appreciated
    them, and not in the condescending way people say they appreciate unskilled workers,
    it wouldn't matter to me whether they were rich or poor.

- en: This gets down to what, specifically, is in a person's utility function. The
    traditional objective function takes one's consumption as the primary objective,
    and then present values the 'utility' of this consumption. This leads to weird
    convolutions, where one 'consumes' children, and actually doesn't enjoy their
    company but still prefers them. I think a more reasonable approach would be to
    assume people are maximizing their external appreciation in society. This is going
    to be increasing in wealth, because the more money one has, the more favors one
    can do, the more people will flatter you to get business or use your boat. And
    it all gets back to maximizing status. A status maximizer maximizes his appreciation
    in this world. Someone looking merely at their consumption bundle should consider
    themselves rich in the West even if they are at the bottom of society working
    as a parking attendant, but of course they would not feel rich at all, they would
    feel very poor. As people crave appreciation from others, maximizing their status
    is a direct path to that end. So is having children.

  zh: 这涉及到一个人的效用函数中具体包含了什么。传统的客观函数将一个人的消费作为主要目标，然后对这种消费的“效用”进行现值化。这导致了怪异的扭曲，一个人“消费”孩子，但实际上并不喜欢他们的陪伴，但仍然更喜欢他们。我认为一个更合理的方法是假设人们在最大化他们在社会中的外部赞赏。这将随着财富的增加而增加，因为一个人拥有的钱越多，他就能做的好事就越多，就会有更多的人来奉承你做生意或使用你的船。最后都回到了最大化地位。一个地位最大化者在这个世界上最大化他的赞赏。只是看着他们的消费包的人应该认为自己在西方是富裕的，即使他们在社会底层工作做停车管理员，但当然他们一点也不感到富有，他们会觉得非常贫穷。人们渴望他人的赞赏，最大化他们的地位是通往这个目标的直接途径。所以，生孩子也是如此。
