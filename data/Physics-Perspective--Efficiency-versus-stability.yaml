    ideas and techniques imported from physics. I will tomorrow try to give some simplified
    discussion of the gist of this argument. What makes this particularly fascinating
    is that it works fully within the confines of standard general equilibrium models,
    and examines how market stability should evolve as the market approaches the ideal
    of market completeness. Agents are assumed to be fully rational, there are no
    problems with asymmetric information, etc. Even here, however, Marsili finds that
    the equilibrium becomes more and more unstable as the ideal is approached. Efficient
    markets are also unstable markets.

    a market with informed (fundamentalist) traders and non-informed (noise) traders,
    and shows, first, that the market becomes efficient as the number of informed
    traders grows. They are assumed in the model to have different kinds of private
    information about market outcomes, and the market becomes efficient, roughly speaking,
    once there are enough traders to cover the space of outcomes so all private information
    gets aggregated into market prices. The paper then introduces a non-informed trader
    -- a chartist or trend follower -- and shows that this trader has a maximum impact
    on the market precisely at the point at which it becomes efficient. The conclusion
    is very much against standard economic thinking:'

  zh: 去年的论文提供了 perhaps 最简洁的论点。它研究了一个有知情（基本面）交易者和非知情（噪声）交易者的市场，并首先表明，随着知情交易者的数量增长，市场变得有效。在模型中，这些交易者被假定为对市场结果拥有不同类型的私人信息，市场变得有效，大体上讲，一旦有足够的交易者覆盖结果的空间，所有私人信息都汇总到市场价格中。然后论文引入了一个非知情交易者——一个图表主义者或趋势追随者——并表明，当市场变得有效时，这个交易者对市场的影响最大。结论与标准经济学思维非常不符：

    This study looks explicitly at how the proliferation of financial instruments
    (derivatives) provides more means for diversifying and sharing risks and takes
    the market to an efficient state. However, it finds that this state is what physicists
    refer to as a "critical state", which is a state characterized by extreme (essentially
    infinite) susceptibility to small disturbances. Any small noise stirs up huge
    fluctuations. Again, efficiency trails instability in its wake. As the paper asserts:'

  zh: 两年前的一篇论文从略微不同的角度探讨了问题。这项研究明确地研究了金融工具（衍生品）的扩散如何提供更多分散和分享风险的手段，并使市场达到有效状态。然而，它发现这种状态正是物理学家所说的“临界状态”，这是一种对小干扰极其敏感的状态（基本上是无限的）。任何小的噪音都会引起巨大的波动。再次，效率紧随其后的是不稳定性。正如论文所述：
- en: This suggests that the hypothesis of Arbitrage Pricing Theory (the notion that
    arbitrage works to keep market in an efficient state) may not be compatible with
    a stable market dynamics.

  zh: 最后，我在彭博社文章中讨论的那篇论文是去年的，它分析了一个特别设定的模型，以包括金融部门。它与标准一般均衡模型非常相似，主要包括两个部分：
- en: 1\. There are investors who aim to take their current wealth and preserve it
    (or make it grow) into the future. They do this by investing in various instruments
    provided by a sector of financial firms. These investors are assumed to be rational
    and have full information and they invest their wealth optimally over the set
    of possible investments.

    on risks in supplying them. They also act optimally, and they hedge their risks
    by trading between themselves. Again, the firms are rational and have full information.

  zh: 2. 有金融公司创造投资工具并承担供应风险。他们也是最优行动，并通过相互之间的交易来对冲风险。同样，这些公司是理性的，拥有完全信息。
- en: Marsili then studies what happens to this world of investors and financial firms
    optimally making decisions as the number of different financial instruments grows.
    The first result confirms expectations -- the financial firms are ever more successful
    in hedging their risks and they can provide the financial instruments more cheaply.
    Investors can therefore invest more effectively. The market becomes efficient.

  zh: Marsili接着研究了在不同的金融工具数量增长时，投资者和金融机构这个世界如何做出最佳决策。第一个结果证实了预期——金融机构在对冲风险方面越来越成功，它们可以更便宜地提供金融工具。投资者因此可以更有效地投资。市场变得有效。
- en: But there are also two unexpected consequences. As Marsili describes them,

  zh: 但也有两个意外后果。正如Marsili所描述的，
- en: 'As markets approach completeness, however, two "unintended consequences" also
    arise: equilibrium portfolios develop a marked susceptibility to idiosynchratic
    shocks and/or parameter uncertainty and hedging engenders divergent trading volumes
    in the interbank market. Combining these, suggests an inverse relation between
    financial stability and the size of the financial sector...'

- en: In other words, the character of the optimum portfolios for both the investors
    and the financial firms becomes hugely sensitive to tiny shocks to the economy.
    As the efficient state is approached, these agents have to work ever harder to
    adjust their holdings to remain in the optimal condition. The market only remains
    efficient through an ever faster and more vigorous churning of investment positions.
    This shows up in the hedging done by the financial firms, where the volume of
    trading required to remain optimally hedged actually becomes infinite as the market
    reaches efficiency.

  zh: 换句话说，对于投资者和金融机构而言，最优投资组合的特征对经济的小幅冲击变得极为敏感。随着有效状态的接近，这些代理必须更加努力地调整其持仓以保持最优状态。市场只有在投资头寸更快、更积极地流转下才能保持有效。这在金融机构的对冲活动中表现出来，实际上，为了保持最佳对冲，所需交易量在市场达到有效时变为无限大。
- en: All three of these papers show much the same thing -- efficiency bringing instability
    along with it. But this latter paper may be the most interesting as it shows directly
    how the size of the financial sector also naturally explodes as this efficient-unstable
    regime is approached. The effect sounds suspiciously like what has happened in
    the past 30 years or so with massive growth in the financial industries in most
    developed nations.

  zh: 这三篇论文都显示了差不多相同的事情——效率带来不稳定。但后一篇论文可能最有意思，因为它直接展示了在有效-不稳定体制接近时，金融部门规模也自然会爆炸式增长。这种效应听起来与过去30年大多数发达国家金融行业的大规模增长非常相似。
- en: What I find really remarkable, however, is that all of this comes from the very
    models that economists have been using for a long time to make arguments about
    market efficiency. Why did it take a physicist to look at what happens to stability
    at the same point? This seems bizarre indeed.
