    Football League (NFL)—whose income profile does not just gradually rise then fall,
    as it does for most workers, but rather has a very large spike lasting only a
    few years. We collected data on all players drafted by NFL teams from 1996 to
    2003\. Given the difficulty of directly measuring consumption of NFL players,
    we test whether they have adequate savings by counting how many retired NFL players
    file for bankruptcy. ***Contrary to the life-cycle model predictions, we find
    that initial bankruptcy filings begin very soon after retirement and continue
    at a substantial rate through at least the first 12 years of retirement.*** Moreover,
    bankruptcy rates are not affected by a player’s total earnings or career length.

    Using data from a survey that asked students who their friends were, Fryer and
    Torelli constructed a measure of how popular each student was among members of
    his or her own race (the index is constructed so that having more popular friends
    confers more popularity than having less popular friends). The results fit the
    predictions of the “acting white” hypothesis -- as students get older, the correlation
    between grades and popularity goes up and up for white kids, but down for black
    kids.

  zh: 弗莱耶开始尝试寻找这些因素。例如，许多人长期以来一直认为黑人文化通过将学术追求贴上“行为白人”的标签来阻碍智力成就。与合著者保罗·托雷利一起，弗莱耶[调查](http://www.quantitativesocialscience.com/uploads/5/8/3/3/5833205/fryer_torelli_2010.pdf)了这个假设。如果学术真的被认为是“行为白人”，那么合理的推论是，成绩好应该与受欢迎程度呈负相关。弗莱耶和小托雷利利用了一项调查的数据，该调查询问了学生他们的朋友是谁，他们构建了一个衡量每个学生在同种族成员中的受欢迎程度的指标（该指数的构建方式是，拥有更多受欢迎的朋友比拥有较少受欢迎的朋友更能带来受欢迎度）。结果符合“行为白人”假设的预测——随着学生的成长，白人孩子的成绩和受欢迎程度之间的相关性越来越高，而黑人孩子的相关性则越来越低。

    of the black-white achievement gap. Many teachers, if asked, will tell you that
    this is the case (though they will probably deny that the discrimination comes
    from their own classrooms!). It’s a very hard thing to measure. But, as Fryer
    and others have [documented](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.169.2586&rep=rep1&type=pdf),
    racial discrimination has become less and less important in the U.S. employment
    market. That doesn’t prove that discrimination isn’t still the culprit at the
    grade school level, but it is suggestive.

- en: Taken all together, Fryer’s work suggests that educational investments, improved
    motivation and cultural change have a good shot at closing the stubborn achievement
    gap between black and white students. That isn't going to please education reform
    opponents such as Diane Ravitch, who denigrate charters and pooh-pooh the idea
    that better education could close the gap. It’s also not going to please a lot
    of conservatives, who typically oppose funneling more resources into government-funded
    education.

  zh: 总的来说，弗莱耶的工作表明，教育投资、提高动机和文化变革有可能缩小黑人学生和白人学生之间顽固的成就差距。这不会让像迪iane·拉维奇这样的教育改革反对者满意，他们贬低特许学校，并嗤之以鼻地认为更好的教育可以缩小差距的想法。这也不会让很多保守派满意，他们通常反对将更多资源投入到政府资助的教育中。
