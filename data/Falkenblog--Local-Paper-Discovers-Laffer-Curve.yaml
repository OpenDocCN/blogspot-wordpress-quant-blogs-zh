- en: My local paper is always for more government spending, and higher taxes on 'the
    rich.' Recently we voted in a Democrat governor and both houses of our state legislature,
    so we are getting higher taxes as expected. What wasn't expected was higher taxes
    on newspapers and the business they contract with, so now we have new Tea Party
    converts. From the

  zh: 我当地的报纸一向支持增加政府支出，并对‘富人’征收更高税。最近我们选入了一位民主党州州长和两院的立法机关，所以我们如期得到了更多的税收。但没料到的是，报纸和他们承包的企业也要交更高的税，因此现在我们有了新的茶党皈依者。来源于

- en: We urge Dayton to reconsider and the Legislature to reject a sales tax on business-to-business
    services, a tax idea the Star Tribune has long opposed. While expanding the consumption
    sales tax to a larger share of the economy and reducing its overall rate, as Dayton
    proposes, is sound tax policy, taxing businesses' service inputs is anything but.
    ... Consider the impact on one particular industry sector -- one this Editorial
    Board serves and understands well -- advertising, information and communications.
    Providers of those services together employ nearly 68,000 Minnesotans. Many of
    them serve clients outside Minnesota and compete with rivals around the country
    and the globe.

  zh: 我们敦促代顿重新考虑，立法机关拒绝对企业间服务征收销售税，这是Star Tribune长期反对的税收措施。代顿提议将消费税扩大至更大比例的经济规模，并减少总体税率，这是合理的税收政策，而对企业服务投入征税则绝非明智之举。...考虑一个特定行业领域的影响--
    这是编辑委员会所服务并且很了解的-- 广告、信息和通讯。 这些服务的提供者共雇佣了近68,000名明尼苏达人。其中许多人为明尼苏达以外的客户提供服务，并与全国乃至全球的竞争对手竞争。
- en: They assert this has been their position all along, but reading the Strib I
    don't remember any such argument, though it's a nice attempt to try to present
    themselves as having a principled stance. Their basic argument is that this will
    actually reduce revenue because Minnesota businesses, including the Star-Tribune,
    will shrink as they raise their prices. But they don't state that so explicitly,
    rather, they allude to it via mentioning competitiveness, and then perfunctorily,
    that this isn't fair.

  zh: 他们断言，这一直是他们的立场，但通过阅读Strib，我不记得有这种论点，尽管他们试图表现自己有原则的立场。他们的基本论点是，实际上这会减少税收，因为明尼苏达的企业，包括Star-Tribune，将在提高价格时缩减。但他们并没有如此明确地表示，而是通过提到竞争力，然后敷衍地表明这样做是不公平的。
- en: I suppose these liberals think we should just tax rich people for the extra
    amount, ignoring that rich people can alter their liabilities by moving headquarters,
    the structure of their various corporations, and lots of other ways. I think the
    Laffer curve is one of the more powerful ideas in macroeconomics, and also one
    of the most ridiculed. At the margin, there always appears to be more revenue
    out there by raising taxes. It reminds me of a famous essay by George Stigler

  zh: 我想这些自由派认为我们应该向富人征税，忽略了富人可以通过搬迁总部，调整其各种公司的结构以及许多其他方式来减少其负担。我认为拉弗曲线是宏观经济学中最有力的思想之一，也是最受嘲笑的。在边际，通过提高税收总会出现更多的税收，这让我想起乔治·施蒂格勒（George
    Stigler）的一个著名文章。
