    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by

    raise rates by a quarter-point every three months. Monetary indicators, such as
    money supply growth and the yield curve, are on a trajectory to flash recessionary
    signals by year-end, if not before. The US sneezes and slows into a mild recession,
    China catches a cold and collapses into a hard landing because of its excess leverage.
    Global contagion spreads into a global synchronized recession whose magnitude
    could be as bad as the last financial crisis.

- en: My lunch companion's key objection to the bearish scenario is the China linkage.
    It is unclear whether a slowing American consumer will trigger a significant slowdown
    in China. Even if Chinese economic growth were to slow, Beijing still has lots
    of policy levers to cushion a downturn. This is an important question. China remains
    the big swing factor in global growth. What if China doesn't collapse? The downside
    risk to my bearish scenario would be very mild by comparison.

  zh: 我午餐伙伴对看跌情景的主要反对意见是中国联系。目前尚不清楚，美国消费者的减缓是否会触发中国显著的经济放缓。即使中国经济增长放缓，北京仍有大量政策杠杆来缓冲经济下行。这是一个重要问题。中国仍然是全球增长的大摇摆因素。如果中国没有崩溃呢？与我的看跌情景相比，下行风险将会非常轻微。
