    on trading the XLE-USO spread that I suggested. While Mr. Teetor has a lot of
    success trading this spread, I must say that I have lost faith in the cointegrating
    characteristic of this spread because of two reasons:'

  zh: 最近，我的一位订阅者Teetor先生在我的博客上发布了一条关于我建议交易的XLE-USO价差的[热情评论](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/10/arbitrage-trade-between-energy-stocks.html#9116664924501773451)。尽管Teetor先生在交易这个价差上取得了很大的成功，但我必须说的是，由于两个原因，我已经对这个价差的协整特性失去了信心：
- en: '1) The spread appeared to have experienced a regime-shift since the historic
    backtest period before August 2006: the out-of-sample performance of the spread
    since then did not support cointegration; and'

  zh: 1) 自2006年8月之前的历史回测期以来，价差似乎经历了一个体制转变：自此以来，价差在此样本外的表现并不支持协整；并且

  zh: 2) 支持XLE与USO之间协整的基本论点在进一步调查中崩溃了。
- en: 'The two reasons are, I believe, intertwined. Unlike GLD (part of a much more
    cointegrating spread that I [discussed](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/reader-suggested-possible-trading.html)
    and tracked in my [premium content](http://www.epchan.com/subscriptions.html)
    area), USO does not actually hold commodity assets in its portfolio. It holds
    nearby futures contracts in oil. When the USO fund started trading in April 2006,
    its price per share was very close to the spot oil price. Now, however, USO is
    trading at about $53, while spot oil price is at about $70.6\. How can a fund
    that is supposed to reflect oil price diverge so much from it after a year and
    5 months? The reason is that the oil futures market has been in contango since
    2005 or so, i.e. far month futures costs more than the nearby contracts, which
    results in negative roll-yield for long position in oil futures. In the historic
    period from which the XLE-USO cointegration relation was established, oil futures
    market exhibited backwardation: far month futures cost less than nearby futures.
    This regime shift partially explains the breakdown of the cointegration relation
    in the present out-of-sample period.'

  zh: 这两个原因我相信是相互关联的。与GLD不同（它是我[讨论](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/reader-suggested-possible-trading.html)并在我的[付费内容](http://www.epchan.com/subscriptions.html)区域跟踪的一个更协整价差的一部分），USO在其投资组合中实际上并不持有商品资产。它持有的是石油的近期期货合约。当USO基金于2006年4月开始交易时，其每份股价与即期石油价格非常接近。然而，现在USO的交易价格约为53美元，而即期石油价格为约70.6美元。一个应该反映石油价格的基金如何在一年零五个月后与其如此背道而驰呢？原因是自2005年左右，石油期货市场一直处于正向市场，即远月期货的价格高于近期合约，这导致石油期货多头持仓产生负滚动收益。而建立XLE-USO协整关系的那个历史期间，石油期货市场表现出反向市场：远月期货的价格低于近期期货。这种体制转变部分解释了当前样本外期间协整关系的破裂。
- en: The lesson I have learned from all these is to avoid analyzing cointegration
    relation when either side of a spread involves futures contracts at different
    points of the forward curve, at least on a time-scale when the shape of that curve
    might change. (I argued before that XLE, the other side of the spread, can be
    modeled as an average over the entire forward curve.) Meanwhile, the fund manager
    of USO would really have done investors a much better favor by getting their hands
    dirty, leasing some oil storage tanks and buying some real oil assets rather than
    keeping their hands clean and dealing in futures contracts alone. After all, retail
    investors like myself can just as easily buy oil futures ourselves, but we can't
    very well go out and rent an oil tank.

  zh: 我从这一切中学到的教训是，在分析协整关系时，要避免涉及到价差两边涉及不同点的前向曲线期货合约，至少在曲线形状可能发生变化的时间尺度上。（我之前曾主张XLE，价差的另一边，可以被建模为整个前向曲线的平均值。）与此同时，USO的基金经理如果真的为投资者做了更好的服务，那就应该动手去做，租用一些石油储罐，并购买一些真正的石油资产，而不是仅仅交易期货合约。毕竟，像我这样的零售投资者可以很容易地自己购买石油期货，但我们却不能很容易地出去租一个石油罐。
