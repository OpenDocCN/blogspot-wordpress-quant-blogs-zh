    reading to the maximum 20-day HV reading, with negative numbers (LTCM and Y2K)
    indicating that HV peaked before the VIX did. The VIX vs. HV column calculates
    the amount in percentage terms that the peak VIX exceeded the peak HV. The VIX>10%10d…
    column reflects how many days transpired from the first VIX close above its 10-day
    moving average to the peak VIX reading. The SPX Drawdown column calculates the
    maximum peak to trough drawdown in the S&P 500 index during the crisis period,
    not from any pre-crisis peak. The VIX:SPX drawdown ratio calculates the percentage
    change in the VIX from the SPX crisis high to the SPX crisis low relative the
    percentage change in the SPX during the same period (of course these are not necessarily
    the VIX highs and lows during the period.) The SPX low relative to the 200-day
    moving average is the maximum amount the SPX fell below its 200-day moving average
    during the crisis. Finally, the last two columns capture the number of consecutive
    days the VIX closed at or above 30 during the crisis and the number of days the

    moving average and the ultimate maximum VIX reading was that the longer the period
    between the initial VIX breakout and the maximum VIX, the higher the VIX spike
    would be. In this case the [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    (LTCM) and 2008 crises support the hypothesis, but the data is spotty elsewhere.
    The current European debt crisis, [Asian Currency Crisis of 1997](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Asian%20financial%20crisis)
    and 9/11 attack all reflect a very rapid escalation of the VIX to its crisis high.
    In the case of the May 2010 ‘[Flash Crash](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/flash%20crash)’
    and the Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown, the maximum VIX reading happened just one

- en: Turing to the SPX drawdown data, the Asian Currency Crisis stands out as one
    instance where the VIX spike seems in retrospect to be out of proportion to the
    SPX peak to trough drawdown during the crisis. On the other side of the ledger,
    the drawdown during the Dotcom Crash appears to be consistent with a much higher
    VIX reading. Here the fact that it took some 2 ½ years for stocks to find a bottom
    meant that when the market finally bottomed, investors were somewhat desensitized
    and some of the fear and panic had already left the market, which is similar to
    what happened at the time of the March 2009 bottom. Note that the median VIX:SPX
    drawdown ratio for all twelve crises is 10.0, which is about 2 ½ times the movement
    in the VIX that one would expect during more normal market conditions.

    ½ 倍。

    above, all but the Asian Currency Crisis dragged the index below its 200-day moving
    average; on the other hand, in all but one of the lesser crises the SPX never
    dropped below its 200-day moving average. Based on this data at least, one might

    a 2% move in about 80% of its calendar years, the VIX has spiked over 30 about
    60% of the years, and the SPX has seen at least one 4% move in about 40% of those
    years. Those 4% moves are rare enough so that they almost always occur in the
    context of some sort of major crisis. In fact, one could argue that a 4% move

    events. There was, for instance, only one [Hurricane Katrina](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Katrina),
    one turn of the clock for Y2K and one earthquake plus tsunami in Japan. As a result,
    the volatility associated with these events was compressed in time and accordingly
    the contagion potential was limited. By contrast, the major volatility events
    are more accurately thought of as systemic threats that ebbed and flowed over
    the course of an extended period, typically with multiple volatility spikes. In
    the same vein, the attempted resolution of these events generally included a complex

- en: Apart from the fundamental thread running through these crises, I also believe
    there is a psychological thread that sometimes spans multiple crises. Specifically,
    I am referring to the shadow that one crisis casts on future crises that follow
    it closely in time. I call this phenomenon ‘[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)’
    and psychologists characterize something similar as [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias).
    Simply stated, disaster imprinting refers to a phenomenon in which the threats
    of financial and psychological disaster are so severe that they leave a permanent
    or semi-permanent scar in one’s psyche. Another way to describe disaster imprinting
    might be to liken it to a low-level financial post-traumatic stress disorder.
    Following the 2008 Financial Crisis, most investors were prone to overestimating
    future risk, which is why the VIX was consistently much higher than realized volatility

  zh: 除了这些危机中贯穿的基本主题外，我还相信还有一个心理主题，有时会跨越多个危机。具体来说，我指的是一个危机给其后紧随其后的未来危机投下的阴影。我称这种现象为‘[灾难印记](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)’，心理学家将类似的东西描述为[可得性偏见](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)。简而言之，灾难印记是指金融和心理灾难的威胁如此严重，以至于它们在一个人的心灵中留下了永久或半永久的伤痕。另一种描述灾难印记的方式可能是将其比作低级别的金融创伤后应激障碍。在2008年金融危机之后，大多数投资者都倾向于高估未来的风险，这就是为什么VIX在2009年和2010年始终比实现波动性高得多的原因。
- en: While it is impossible to prove, my sense is that if the events of 2008 were
    not imprinted in the minds of investors, the current crisis atmosphere might be
    characterized by a much lower degree of volatility and anxiety.

  zh: 尽管无法证明，但我的感觉是，如果2008年的事件没有深深印在投资者的脑海中，那么当前的危机氛围可能会表现出较低程度的波动性和焦虑。

- en: As this goes to press, the current volatility storm is drawing energy from concerns
    about the European Sovereign Debt Crisis as well as fears of a slowdown in global
    economic activity. The rise in volatility has coincided with a swift and violent
    selloff in stocks that has seen six days in which the S&P 500 index has moved
    at least 4% either up or down – a rate that is unprecedented outside of the 2008
    Financial Crisis.

  zh: 正在印刷时，当前的波动性风暴正在从对欧洲主权债务危机的担忧以及对全球经济活动放缓的恐惧中汲取能量。波动性的上升与股票的迅速而剧烈的抛售同时发生，这已经看到标准普尔500指数在六天内至少上涨或下跌了4%
    - 这是2008年金融危机以外的空前速率。
- en: Ultimately, the severity of a volatility storm is a function of both the magnitude
    and the duration of the crisis, as well as the risk of contagion to other geographies,
    sectors and institutions. Act I of the European Sovereign Debt Crisis, in which
    [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece) played the starring
    role, can trace its origins back to December 2009\. In the intervening period,
    it has spread across Europe and has sent shockwaves across the globe.

  zh: 最终，市场波动风暴的严重程度取决于危机的规模和持续时间，以及向其他地理区域、行业和机构传染的风险。欧洲主权债务危机的第一幕，其中[希腊](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)扮演主角，可以追溯到2009年12月。在此期间，危机已蔓延至整个欧洲，并在全球范围内引发了震荡。
- en: By historical standards the volatility aspect of the current crisis is more
    severe than at any time during World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis and just
    about any crisis other than the Great Depression, [Black Monday of 1987](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987)
    and the 2008 Financial Crisis.

  zh: 从历史的角度来看，当前危机的波动方面比二战期间、古巴导弹危机以及除了大萧条、[1987年黑色星期一](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987)和2008年金融危机之外的几乎所有危机都更为严重。
- en: In the data and commentary above, I have attempted to establish some historical
    context for volatility during various crises extending back to 1929 and in the
    process give investors some metrics for evaluating current and future [volatility
    spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes). In addition,
    it is my hope that concepts such as meta-crises and disaster imprinting can help
    to bolster the interpretive framework for investors who are seeking a deeper understanding
    of volatility storms and the crises from which they arise.

  zh: 在上述数据和评论中，我尝试建立了对1929年以来各种危机的波动情况进行历史背景的一些认识，并在此过程中为投资者提供了一些评估当前和未来[波动激增](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)的指标。此外，我希望诸如元危机和灾难印记等概念可以帮助加强投资者对波动风暴及其来源危机的解释框架的理解。
