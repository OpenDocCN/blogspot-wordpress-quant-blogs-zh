- en: A subscriber recently asked me about my take on position sizing, and more specifically
    using Optimal f. For those unfamiliar, Optimal f is a calculation derived by Ralph
    Vince which computes the optimal position size that would lead to a portfolio’s
    fastest growth rate. Mr. Vince has written several books on the subject and I
    do recommend his work.

  zh: 一位订阅者最近问我关于头寸大小的看法，特别是使用最优f。对于不熟悉的人来说，最优f是通过 Ralph Vince 计算得出的，它计算出会导致投资组合最快增长速度的最优头寸大小。Vince先生就这个主题写了好几本书，我确实推荐他的作品。

    that matter).

  zh: 以下是我对使用最优f（或任何其他头寸大小公式）的看法。
- en: Optimal f may be the mathematically optimal size for a position IF the trades
    are managed in an optimal manner. For many people, positions of "optimal" size
    feel aggressive. While our perception is often that we have a large edge on a
    particular trade or strategy, the edge often isn't THAT great. In order to maintain
    your edge you need to be able to trade the strategy in an "optimal" manner. Whether
    the strategy is automated or discretionary doesn't matter. You need to be able
    to take entries when they trigger. You need to be able to take exits when they
    trigger. But just as important and sometimes most difficult is you also need to
    be able to SIT when there is neither an entry nor an exit triggering.

  zh: 如果交易管理得当，最优f可能是头寸的数学最优大小。对于很多人来说，“最优”大小的头寸看起来很激进。尽管我们常常认为在特定的交易或策略上有很大的优势，但这个优势往往并没有那么大。为了保持你的优势，你需要能够以“最优”的方式交易策略。无论策略是自动的还是主观的都不重要。你需要能够在触发时进行入场。你需要能够在触发时进行出场。但同样重要的是，有时最具挑战性的是，你还需要能够在既没有入场也没有出场触发时“坐”着。
- en: The sitting can often be difficult when traders have what they perceive as a
    large position that they are managing. Many traders have a tendency to want to
    manage the trade more carefully with large positions. This may mean tightening
    stops sooner or taking partial profits a little quicker. Doing this "feels" good
    and it may get the trader to a breakeven level faster, but in the long run it
    will almost always either reduce or destroy the edge of the strategy. Tighter
    stops and quicker profit taking effectively means more losers and smaller winners.
    Few strategies can withstand more losers and smaller winners and still look good.

  zh: 当交易者管理他们认为很大的头寸时，坐着往往是很困难的。许多交易者倾向于更仔细地管理大头寸的交易。这可能意味着更早地收紧止损或稍微更快地取得部分利润。这样做“感觉”很好，也可能让交易者更快地达到盈亏平衡点，但在长期内，它几乎总是要么减少要么破坏策略的优势。更早的止损和更快的获利意味着更多的亏损和较小的赢家。很少有策略能够承受更多的亏损和较小的赢家仍然表现良好。
- en: Optimal f may be the mathematical optimal size, but in my view the optimal size
    is the closest you can get to Optimal f and still execute your strategies as they
    were designed - while keeping your sanity.

  zh: 最优f可能是数学上的最优大小，但在我看来，最优大小是尽可能接近最优f的同时，还能按照设计执行你的策略 - 同时保持你的理智。
