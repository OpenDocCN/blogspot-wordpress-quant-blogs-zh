- en: I am generally not a fan of so-called [air quotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes),
    nor am I a fan of the gratuitous use of quotation marks for added emphasis in
    print. That being said, I have this tendency to invent new concepts and attach
    labels to them that I pull out of the sky. When I do so, as is the case with [event
    theta](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20theta), the quotation
    marks are merely shorthand for warning readers that I am making stuff up and cloaking
    it in somewhat fancy-sounding attire. In other words, if you Google “event theta”
    you will find a lot of information about sorority functions and the like, but
    nothing (as far as I can tell) about options concepts.

  zh: 我通常不是所谓“空中引号”的粉丝，也不是印刷中随意使用引号来加强语气的粉丝。话说回来，我有一个倾向，就是发明新概念并给它们贴上我从天而降的标签。当我这样做时，如“事件斜杠”的案例，引号只是简写，用来警告读者我在编造东西，并将其伪装成听起来相当花哨的外衣。换句话说，如果你在谷歌上搜索“事件斜杠”，你会发现很多关于姐妹会活动和类似的信息，但据我所知，没有关于期权概念的信息。

- en: Nineteen days ago, Japan was hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a subsequent
    tsunami that measured at least 30 feet high in some places. As everyone now knows,
    the earthquake and particularly the tsunami damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
    power plant and set off a [chain of events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_I_nuclear_accidents)
    that resulted in a partial core meltdown, damage to at least one containment vessel,
    overheating of spent fuel rods and dangerous levels of radiation leaks. The situation
    has been a fluid one, with a limited flow of information, particularly during
    the early stages of the disaster.

  zh: 十九天前，日本遭受了9.0级地震和随后海啸的袭击，某些地区的海啸高达30英尺。正如大家现在所知道的，地震尤其是海啸损坏了福岛第一核电站，并引发了一系列事件，导致部分核心熔化，至少有一个容器损坏，乏燃料棒过热和危险的辐射泄漏。情况一直在变化，信息流动有限，特别是在灾难的早期阶段。
- en: As these events unfolded, seemingly like a slow-motion train wreck, I kept asking
    myself whether time was in favor of or working against the efforts of those who
    were trying to limit the damage to the nuclear facility and surrounding areas.
    In other words, was this a positive theta event (time in our favor) or a negative
    theta event (a fight against the clock.) Not being an expert in the field of nuclear
    energy and knowing that certain factors could spiral out of control quickly, but
    also knowing that efforts were underway to stabilize some of the processes in
    the plant, I was left to guessing whether current efforts were more likely to
    fall short and result in a vicious cycle or were expected to stem the problem
    and turn the tide in favor of the rescue team.

  zh: 随着这些事件的发展，似乎像一场慢动作的火车出轨，我一直问自己时间是否在支持那些试图限制核设施及其周边地区损害的人的努力，或者是否在与他们作对。换句话说，这是不是一个正斜杠事件（时间在我们这边）还是一个负斜杠事件（与时间赛跑）。我不是核能领域的专家，知道某些因素可能会迅速失控，但同时也知道工厂中的一些过程正在进行稳定，我只能猜测当前的努力更有可能失败，导致恶性循环，还是有望遏制问题，使救援队伍扭转局势。
- en: Knowing whether this was a positive or negative theta event also has substantial
    implications for investment strategies. From a hedging perspective, event theta
    could influence the selection of hedging vehicles, the anticipated timing for
    those hedges, how the hedges might be structured and what sort of prices might
    be appropriate. For the speculative investor, event theta can also help to determine
    the risk-reward payoff structure and how it varies over time. Anyone who trades
    in VIX futures and deals with the VIX term structure on a daily basis should have
    some insights into potential mismatches between event theta and term structure.

  zh: 了解这是否是一个正面的θ事件（positive theta event）还是一个负面的θ事件（negative theta event）对于投资策略有重大影响。从对冲的角度来看，事件θ可能会影响对冲工具的选择、那些对冲预期的时机、对冲的结构以及可能适宜的价格类型。对于投机性投资者来说，事件θ也可以帮助他们确定风险-回报的支付结构以及它是如何随时间变化的。任何交易VIX期货并每天处理VIX期限结构的人应该对事件θ与期限结构之间可能的不匹配有一些洞察。
- en: Event theta is an idea that complements some of the thinking I have presented
    in this space [earlier](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html)
    regarding [event volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility).
    I maintain that it applies to [Libya](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Libya),
    the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    and almost every other threat to the financial markets. Going forward, I will
    give event volatility and event theta some additional treatment in this space
    as conditions warrant.

  zh: 事件θ是一个与我在这个领域[之前](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html)提出的一些想法相辅相成的观点，关于[事件波动率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility)。我认为它适用于[利比亚](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Libya)，[欧洲主权债务危机](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)，以及几乎对金融市场构成
    every other threat的其他所有威胁。展望未来，我将根据情况需要在这个领域对事件波动率（event volatility）和事件θ（event
    theta）给予一些额外的关注。
