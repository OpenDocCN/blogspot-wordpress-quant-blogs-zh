- en: Why should anyone care about this? Well, it just might be worth noting that
    in the 19 year history of the VIX, four of the eight largest negative divergences
    between the VIX and the SPX 30 day historical volatility have occurred in the
    past two weeks (the other four were from August 2002). Looking back at the history
    of these negative divergences, they have regularly occurred just before substantially
    below average market performance. The 14 instances in which the VIX was at least
    10 points below the 30 day historical volatility of the SPX, for instance, resulted
    in an average loss of 8.6% in the next 20 days. The 76 instances in which the
    VIX was at least 5 points below the 30 day HV of the SPX produced an average return
    of -1.2% in the next 20 days.

  zh: '-   那么为什么有人会关心这个呢？嗯，也许值得注意的是，在VIX的19年历史上，过去两周内发生了八次VIX与标普500指数30日历史波动率之间最大的负偏差中的四次（其余四次来自2002年8月）。回顾这些负偏差的历史，它们在市场表现显著低于平均水平之前经常发生。例如，VIX至少比标普500指数30日历史波动率低10点的14个实例，在接下来的20天内平均亏损了8.6％。而VIX至少比标普500指数30日历史波动率低5点的76个实例，在接下来的20天内平均收益为-1.2％。'
- en: If you look at positive divergences, the story is the exact opposite. The 29
    instances in which the VIX was at least 15 points higher than the 30 day HV of
    the SPX led to a 6.6% return over the course of the next 20 days. For 67 instances
    in which the VIX was 12.5 points higher than the SPX’s 30 day HV, the 20 day return
    was 4.5%.

- en: Before one jumps to conclusions about the current environment, it is worth noting
    that on October 10^(th), the spread between the VIX and the 30 day HV of the SPX
    was 16.2 (and the SPX jumped 11.6% the next day.) Friday marks the 20^(th) trading
    day since this signal. Is it possible that the [VIX spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spread)
    will begin to create a strong downward pull on the markets by the end of the week?

  zh: '-   在得出当前环境结论之前，值得注意的是，在10月10日，VIX与标普500指数30日历史波动率之间的利差为16.2（而标普500指数次日上涨了11.6％。）周五标志着自这一信号以来的第20个交易日。有没有可能在周末之前，[VIX利差](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spread)开始对市场产生强烈的向下拉力？'
