    I track the progress of two Chinese ETF pairs that measure the relative performance
    of Chinese consumer stocks relative to a mainly financial stock basket. The long
    side on the first pair, PGJ, is heavily weighted in Chinese technology names with
    heavy exposure to Chinese consumption (e.g. NetEase, Baidu). The long side on
    the second pair is Global X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ), which is weighted towards
    direct consumer plays like Great Wall Motor and Vipshop. The short side on these
    baskets are predominantly Chinese finance and bank stocks, which represents the
    old model of credit-driven infrastructure growth.

    When the lines are rising, consumer stocks are outperforming, which is an indication
    that re-balancing is progressing well. When the line is falling, re-balancing
    is suffering a setback. As the chart shows, both pairs have been in a downtrend
    for about a year. This is an indication that the market believes that, despite
    all the rhetoric, Beijing has gone back to the same-old-same-old model of credit-driven
    infrastructure growth.

- en: In summary, this is the story of how China is re-balancing and not re-balancing
    its economy. Consumption is re-balancing, but it may not necessarily be to the
    benefit of domestic suppliers. Chinese manufacturers need to start to develop
    the right corporate culture and learn to move up the value chain to focus on quality
    instead of just price. Until that happens, much of the benefits of re-balancing
    growth towards the Chinese household sector is likely to accrue to foreign firms.

  zh: 总结来说，这是中国如何实现再平衡而非不实现经济再平衡的故事。消费正在再平衡，但这并不一定对国内供应商有利。中国制造商需要开始培养正确的企业文化，并学会向上游价值链发展，专注于质量而非仅仅价格。在这一切发生之前，中国家庭部门经济增长再平衡的大部分好处可能会流向外国公司。
