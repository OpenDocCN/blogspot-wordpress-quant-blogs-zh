    the business line managers, and was impressed by the fact that all of them had
    rather sterling track records, especially in the last recession. But I later figured
    this was all survivorship bias: the losers in the last recession lost their jobs.
    Thus, each thought they had some special alpha, special asset class, impervious
    to the mistakes of those who caused the big losses in the past. For a 45 year
    old who has never really screwed up it''s hard not to think this is the case,
    as opposed to merely the blind selection process of capitalism. This error is
    the fundamental genesis of business cycles, in my opinion.'

  zh: 我在 KeyCorp 负责资本配置时，与许多业务线管理人员交谈，对他们都有印象，尤其是在上一次经济衰退期间，所有人都有相当出色的业绩记录。但后来我意识到这都是幸存者偏差：上次经济衰退中的失败者失去了工作。因此，每个人都认为自己拥有某种特殊的
    alpha，特殊的资产类别，不受过去造成巨大损失的人的错误影响。对于一个从未真正搞砸过的 45 岁人来说，很难不认为这是事实，而不仅仅是资本主义的盲目选择过程。在我看来，这种错误是商业周期的根本起源。

- en: (see picture, I don't think they are related but she's a lot prettier). I was
    intrigued by the idea that business cycles were caused by a misallocation of resources,
    as opposed to merely 'too much' investment. That is, say you have 10% of the country's
    resources in internet development, but discover the demand only wants 5%. All
    is fine as long as you don't care about profits, look at sales/price ratios, but
    then eventually people get tired of not making money, someone says 'the emperor
    has no clothes! There will never be profits', and everyone stops investing in
    these areas. The transition from the old to new regime is only possible via firm
    failures and involuntary unemployment, because people don't switch to new jobs
    until their old ones are gone, forcibly.

  zh: （见图片，我不认为它们有关系，但她更漂亮）。我对商业周期是由资源错误配置引起的想法很感兴趣，而不仅仅是‘投资过多’。也就是说，假设你有国家资源的 10%
    用于互联网发展，但发现需求只需要 5%。只要你不在意利润，只看销售/价格比就没问题，但最终人们会厌倦不赚钱，有人会说‘皇帝没穿衣服！永远不会有利润’，所有人都停止投资于这些领域。从旧体制过渡到新体制只有通过企业失败和非自愿失业才可能实现，因为人们直到旧工作消失后才会转换到新工作，是被迫的。
- en: My only beef with the Austrians is that they emphasized the genesis of this
    missallocation via money creation, especially the fiat money creation of central
    banks and how this causes the interest rate to be 'too low', causing overinvestment
    in capital. This again gets into a straight aggregate overinvestment story, and
    that isn't very empirically robust. I think to the extent there is overinvestment,
    it isn't

  zh: 我对奥地利学派唯一的不满是，他们强调这种错误分配是通过货币创造引起的，特别是中央银行的法定货币创造，以及这如何导致利率“过低”，从而导致对资本的过度投资。这又涉及到一个纯粹的总体过度投资故事，这并不是很经验主义的。我认为，在过度投资的程度上，它并不存在

- en: investment nearly as much as in the wrong sectors. Today, that sector is housing,
    and finance. The key is finding some metrics one can apply to these subcategories
    to see that it is overinvested, and if there is some consistent tipping point
    in such a metric. The problem I see is that for commercial real estate in 1990,
    or residential real estate in 2008, there were real profits and cash flow immediately
    prior, based on people buying assets that were overvalued. In contrast, in the
    tech bubble, there were no profits immediately prior to the correction. So cash-flow
    in the sector would not work. You could say, use cashflow plus some metric of
    collateral overvaluation, but it is not obvious to construct a model of this,
    as even Shiller's 2006 revision of Irrational Exuberance had a rather wishy-washy
    forecast of housing prices (could go up, could go down) even though in hindsight
    it appears we were at the peak of an unsustainable housing bubble. I'm sure commercial
    real estate had a similar issue in 1990.

  zh: 投资并不是在错误的行业中。今天，这个行业是房地产和金融。关键是找到一些可以应用于这些子类别的度量标准，以查看它是否过度投资，并且是否存在某种一致的触发点在这样的度量标准中。我看到的问题是，对于1990年的商业房地产，或者2008年的住宅房地产，在此之前有真正的利润和现金流，这是基于人们购买被高估的资产。相比之下，在科技泡沫中，在纠正之前没有即时利润。所以该部门的现金流不起作用。你可以说，使用现金流加上一些抵押品过度价值的度量标准，但很难构建这样一个模型，因为即使在Shiller对《非理性狂喜》进行2006年修订时，对房价的预测也相当含糊不清（可能上升，可能下降），尽管事后看来我们处于一个不可持续的房地产泡沫的顶峰。我相信商业房地产在1990年也存在类似的问题。

- en: approach because until these guys lose their jobs, and firms fail, you won't
    get the appropriate (dare I say optimal) reallocation of resources. Looking at
    the current housing bubble, and all the strange incentives and errors by investors,
    legislators, regulators, etc., the missallocation's genesis is not unicausal,
    but one key is that it generally is in an industry that did well in the prior
    recession. Thus, just as commercial real estate CDO's had very low relative loss
    rates relative to other CDO's subsequent to 1990, I suspect that buying residential
    real estate CDO's now is probably one of the better investments around if you
    are in that space. Beware of the outperformers, as failure is endogenous to any
    business plan because success breeds overconfidence via the overattribution of
    their success to alpha versus random luck, though as always luck, skill, and effort
    are relevant.

  zh: 直到这些人失去工作，公司倒闭，资源得不到适当（我敢说是最优）的重新配置，你都不会得到合适的方法。看看当前的房地产泡沫，以及投资者、立法者、监管者等的所有奇怪的激励和错误，错配的起源不是单一的，但一个关键是它通常发生在上一次衰退中表现良好的行业。因此，就像商业房地产CDO相对于1990年后的其他CDO具有非常低的相对损失率一样，我怀疑现在购买住宅房地产CDO可能是你在这个领域中最好的投资之一。要小心那些表现出色的人，因为失败是任何商业计划的内在特性，因为成功会通过将他们的成功归因于alpha与随机幸运相比，过度自信，尽管幸运、技能和努力始终是相关的。
