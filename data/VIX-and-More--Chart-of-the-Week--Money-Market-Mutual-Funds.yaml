    in January 2009, it generated a surprising amount of controversy. A follow-up

    also seemed to polarize some of the readership here.'

- en: In retrospect, this data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) as well
    as similar data from AMG Data Services did an excellent job of keeping track of
    the flow of funds in and out of cash and therefore have been excellent proxies
    for a large part of the net change in demand for equities.

  zh: 回顾起来，投资公司研究所（ICI）的这些数据以及AMG数据服务公司的类似数据在追踪资金流入和流出现金方面做得非常出色，因此它们在很大程度上是净需求变化的良好代表。
- en: In the chart below, note that money market mutual fund assets began declining
    sharply in the second week in March 2009 (after topping in January 2009,) just
    as stocks were bottoming and starting to catch a bid. In the twenty months since
    the bottom in stocks, net changes to money market mutual funds have been a solid
    coincident and sometimes leading indicator of demand for stocks.

  zh: 在下面的图表中，请注意，货币市场共同基金资产在2009年3月中旬开始急剧下降（在2009年1月达到顶峰后，)正是在股票触底并开始获得买入的时候。在股票触底后的二十个月里，货币市场共同基金的净变化一直是股票需求的稳固同时和有时领先指标。
- en: I am resurrecting this chart again for several reasons, not the least of which
    is that the decline in money market mutual funds has lessened considerably since
    the end of April, when stocks hit their 2010 highs. Additionally, last week’s
    increase of $25 billion in money market mutual funds was the largest since July
    2009 and the second largest since January 2009\. While this may not mean anything,
    I like to be provocative with these kinds of charts. Readers should at least be
    open to the possibility that most of the [cash on the sidelines](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/cash%20on%20the%20sidelines)
    that will ultimately be committed to stocks in a bull market has already been
    committed. Perhaps it will take a significant downturn in bond prices for the
    next large pool of money to be moved into equities.

  zh: 我再次翻出这张图表有几个原因，其中最不重要的是，自4月底以来，股票达到2010年的高点以来，货币市场共同基金的下降已经大幅减缓。此外，上周货币市场共同基金增加了250亿美元，这是自2009年7月以来的最大增幅，也是自2009年1月以来的第二大增幅。虽然这可能意味着什么，但我喜欢用这类图表挑衅。读者至少应该对大多数[现金在边际](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/cash%20on%20the%20sidelines)最终已经投入到股票市场的可能性持开放态度。或许债券价格的显著下跌会让下一大笔资金流入股市。

    watching.
