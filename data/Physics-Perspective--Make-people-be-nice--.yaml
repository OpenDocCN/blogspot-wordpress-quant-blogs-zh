- en: great TED talk by British comedian Tony Hawkes. It's inspiring. He makes a crazy
    proposal for a maximum income scheme; it's crazy but also really different and
    creative. He doesn't want to limit rich people or tear them down, but to help
    them do even better, and to help everyone else in the process. It's an idea of
    how we could set up institutions so that people work hard to be nice and to do
    socially beneficial things.
