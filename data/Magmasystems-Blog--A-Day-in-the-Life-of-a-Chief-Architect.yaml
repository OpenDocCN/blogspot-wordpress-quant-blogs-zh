- en: As I mentioned in my last blog posting, I have become so screaming busy that
    I have not had as much of a chance to blog as I would like. The increased workload
    has been mainly due to my new title of Chief Architect of Equities, and the fact
    that I now manage a few other teams besides the Complex Event Processing team.
    I "back into" this position after the last reorganization at my company. When
    I first joined my company in August 2006, I was hired to work for the Chief Architect
    of Equities. He "left" the company in January 2008 (I was already out of his group
    by then), and another person took over the position, albeit in a less "pompous"
    capacity. This person only lasted one year, and in January of 2009, I was asked
    if I would like the position. Unfortunately, I am never one to say no, and here
    I sit as Chief Architect, waiting for a similar fate to befall me.

  zh: 正如我在上一篇博客文章中提到的，我的工作变得非常繁忙，以至于我没有像我希望那样有很多时间来写博客。工作量的增加主要是由于我获得了股票首席架构师的头衔，以及除了复杂事件处理团队之外，我还管理着其他几个团队。我在公司的最后一次重组后“进入”了这个职位。当我于2006年8月加入公司时，我是被雇佣为股票首席架构师的。他在2008年1月“离开”了公司（那时我已经不在他的团队里了），然后另一个人接替了这个职位，尽管他的能力并不那么“自大”。这个人只呆了一年，然后在2009年1月，我被问是否愿意担任这个职位。不幸的是，我从不拒绝，于是我坐在这里，等着同样的事情发生在我身上。
- en: In a nutshell, the Chief Architect position is 1/3 paperwork, 1/3 visionary,
    and 1/3 committees. What I do is most likely done by all of the Chief Architects
    at all of the various investment banks. There is no secret sauce in what I am
    about to write. We all have the same kinds of paperwork, we all sit on the same
    kinds of technical committees, we all meet with the same vendors, and we all read
    the same magazines and blogs.

  zh: 简而言之，首席架构师的职位分为三部分：1/3是文书工作，1/3是富有远见的规划，还有1/3是委员会工作。我所做的工作很可能是所有投资银行首席架构师都在做的事情。我即将写的内容没有秘诀。我们都有同样的文书工作，我们都参加同样的技术委员会，我们都与同样的供应商会面，我们都阅读同样的杂志和博客。

- en: In a company as big as mine, there is an incredible amount of process. Everything
    has to be approved in triplicate. Every request for a "restricted" piece of software
    has to be overridden by me. Every request for a server has to be approved by me.
    I have to eyeball every new purchase, and I have to track which projects have
    end-of-life components. I also have a dotted line into the CTO of Capital Markets,
    so Equities has to make sure that they align themselves with whatever roadmap
    the CTO is working on.

  zh: 在一个像我这样的公司里，流程数量惊人。一切都需要批准三次。每个对“受限”软件的请求都必须由我 overridden。每个服务器请求都必须由我批准。我必须审查每一笔新采购，并且必须跟踪哪些项目有生命周期的组件。我还有一条与资本市场CTO的虚线，所以股票部门必须确保他们与CTO正在制定的任何路线图保持一致。
- en: I wake up at 5:30 in the morning, turn on my computer, log in to my work email,
    and I spend the next half-hour doing approvals. First comes the server approvals,
    which are easy. Then come the requests for restricted software. Most companies
    have a Buy/Sell/Hold rating on every piece of software, and we are no different.
    We have Approved/Restricted/Prohibited. For some reason, the people who rate the
    software have decided that some essential pieces of software that people need
    to do their jobs are in the Restricted category, which means that I need to approve
    their usage. So, everyone who needs this software has to write a rationale for
    why they need it, which I need to read, and then either approve or ask questions
    about.

  zh: 我早上5:30醒来，打开电脑，登录到我的工作邮箱，接下来的半小时用来审批工作。首先是对服务器的审批，这是比较容易的。然后是请求使用受限软件的申请。大多数公司对每款软件都有一套买入/卖出/持有的评级，我们也不例外。我们有批准/受限/禁止的分类。出于某种原因，评软件的人决定将一些人们完成工作所必需的关键软件归入受限类别，这意味着我需要审批它们的使用。所以，需要这些软件的每个人都必须写一份为什么需要它的理由，我需要阅读，然后要么批准要么提出问题。
- en: I also need to conduct Architectural Reviews on the major Equities projects.
    When you take TARP money, your company is under increased scrutiny. You are audited
    internally by the Audit team, who like to pick projects and start asking tough
    questions, mostly around security and high-availability. This is supposed to prepare
    you for audits by the government, who want to make sure that their TARP investments
    are well safeguarded. As part of the audit process, you have to show them that
    the projects have undergone extensive architectural reviews. So, this is another
    effort that I head up.

  zh: 我还需要对主要的股票项目进行架构评审。当你接受TARP资金时，你的公司会受到更严格的审查。内部审计团队会对你的公司进行内部审计，他们喜欢挑选项目并开始提出一些难题，主要围绕安全和高可用性。这是为了让你为政府的审计做好准备，他们希望确保他们的TARP投资得到妥善保护。作为审计过程的一部分，你必须向他们展示项目已经进行了广泛的架构评审。所以，这也是我负责的另一项工作。
- en: As part of the review process, I am constantly looking for duplication of effort,
    and if I find duplication, I try to push for consolidation. Not surprisingly,
    there are lots and lots of silos in our division. These silos arise because of
    the competitive nature between groups, because of acquisitions that we make where
    the acquired company has their own technology stack, and because of people who
    we hire from other companies who bring their own ideas as to how things should
    be done. So, part of the Architect's job is to have a broad vision over both the
    technology stack and the business flow, and push for consolidation.

  zh: 作为评审过程的一部分，我一直在寻找重复劳动的现象，如果我发现了重复，我会尝试推动合并。不出所料，我们部门有很多很多孤岛。这些孤岛的出现是因为各个组之间的竞争性质，因为我们进行的收购中，被收购公司有自己的技术栈，以及我们从其他公司招聘来的人，他们带来了自己关于如何做事的想法。因此，建筑师的一部分工作就是对技术栈和业务流程有广泛的视野，并推动合并。

- en: There are a couple of tech councils that I sit on, some which meet every week
    and some which meet every month. Most of these tech councils are comprised of
    the senior technologists and the senior management across the Capital Markets
    division. What we do is try to tackle a certain topic for a few weeks, like Messaging
    and Caching. We try to see what is being done now in the firm, what needs we will
    have, and we try to come up with the ideal future state. From time to time, we
    also bring in certain vendors to give us a level-setting in our knowledge of a
    certain technology stack. Committees often involve creating written reports and
    nice Powerpoints, and yours truly has his share of that kind of work to do.

  zh: 我担任了几家技术委员会的成员，有些每周开会，有些每月开会。这些技术委员会大多数由资本市场部门的资深技术人员和高级管理人员组成。我们所做的是针对某个主题进行几周的研究，比如消息传递和缓存。我们会尝试了解公司目前所做的工作，我们将需要什么，并尝试提出理想的未来状态。偶尔，我们也会请某些供应商来为我们提供某一技术栈知识的标准化培训。委员会的工作往往包括编写报告和制作精美的PPT，而我也有份参与这类工作。
- en: When the committees make a decision, there is usually some degree of backlash.
    There are groups who have been invested in certain technologies, and those technologies
    have just been declared as non-strategic. There are groups who need to support
    users who are still running Windows 2000, and certain technologies just won't
    work on older machines and ten year old operating systems. And, there are people
    who just will not listen to any decision that is made by committee (with good
    reason). So, part of the committees' jobs are to go out and try to sell the decisions
    to the populace at large. Which involves more meetings and more Powerpoints.

  zh: 当委员会做出决定时，通常会有一定的反弹。有一些团队已经投资于某些技术，而这些技术刚刚被宣布为非战略性的。有一些团队需要支持仍在使用Windows 2000的用户，而某些技术根本无法在老旧的机器和十年前的操作系统上运行。还有一些人就是不愿意听从一个委员会做出的任何决定（有充分的理由）。因此，委员会的一部分工作就是出去尝试向大众推销这些决定。这涉及到更多的会议和更多的PPT。

    technology stack. So, I get to read a lot of blogs, read a lot of magazines like
    Wall Street and Technology, Waters Magazine, Automated Trader, and the A-Team
    reports, and I get to see what new technology is out there and what other companies
    are doing. If something looks interesting, I try to invite the vendors in for
    a talk. Sometimes these talks result in a POC with the vendor, and I have to coordinate
    the POC and make sure that other interested people in Equities can take advantage
    of the POCs. We are interested in all of the usual stuff .... Complex Event Processing,
    Messaging, Caching, Hardware Acceleration, better and faster ways to create models,
    faster ways to compute prices, ways of monitoring and improving latency and throughput,
    etc.

  zh: 这是工作中有趣的一部分。我们必须用我们的技术堆栈推动公司前进。所以我得以阅读很多博客，阅读很多像《华尔街与技术》、《Waters杂志》、《自动化交易员》以及A团队报告等杂志，并得以了解外面有哪些新技术以及其他公司正在做什么。如果某件事看起来很有趣，我会尝试邀请供应商来交谈。有时这些谈话会导致与供应商的POC，我必须协调POC并确保Equities中其他感兴趣的人可以利用POC。我们对所有通常的东西都感兴趣……复杂事件处理、消息传递、缓存、硬件加速、创建模型的更好更快方法、更快计算价格的方法、监控和改进延迟和吞吐量等。
- en: I also get asked for a lot of advice from newly-formed companies. There are
    a number of start-up companies (and very big companies) who are targetting products
    towards Capital Markets, and from time to time, I receive requests from these
    companies for a meeting in order to help validate their ideas. Some people might
    say that we are spending our valuable time giving free consulting to a small company,
    but if we really like something, and we are the first ones on the block to see
    their technology, then we might decide to make a principal investment in the company.
