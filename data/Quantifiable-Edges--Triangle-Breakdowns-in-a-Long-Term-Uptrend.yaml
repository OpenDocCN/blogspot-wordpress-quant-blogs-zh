    and what a break (like we saw yesterday) might mean.

  zh: . 昨晚在订阅者信件中，我重新审视了这些形态以及昨天看到的突破（如我们昨天看到的那样）可能意味着什么。
- en: For coding purposes I simply defined a triangle as a pattern where the most
    recent swing high was lower than the previous swing high, and the most recent
    swing low was higher than the previous swing low, and the market was currently
    between those two points. This admittedly isn't the most sophisticated description,
    and some market technicians might suggest additional nuances should be included.
    Still, it seemed to be enough to identify the basic pattern of a tightening range.

  zh: 出于编程目的，我简单地将三角形定义为一个模式，其中最新的摆动高点低于之前的摆动高点，最新的摆动低点高于之前的摆动低点，市场目前正处于这两个点之间。这显然不是最复杂的描述，一些市场技术人员可能会建议应包括更多细微差别。尽管如此，这似乎足以识别紧缩范围的基本模式。
- en: I set the entry parameter to be a break above the most recent swing high or
    below the most recent swing low. Here it could certainly be argued that a trend
    line break might be more effective. I personally don't believe it would make a
    whole lot of difference.

  zh: 我将入场参数设置为突破最新摆动高点或最新摆动低点。这里可以争论趋势线突破可能更有效。我个人认为这并不会有很大区别。
- en: Once entered the strategy was designed to exit when price either reached its
    target or its stop area. To calculate the target price I simply took the height
    of the triangle and extended that past the entry point. The stop was set at the
    opposing swing high or swing low that would have triggered an entry in the opposite
    direction had the triangle broken the other way. No trailing stops or other trade
    management techniques were incorporated.

  zh: 一旦进入策略，设计用于在价格达到目标或止损区域时退出。为了计算目标价格，我只是三角形的高度延伸超出入场点。止损设置在相反的摆动高点或摆动低点，如果三角形突破另一方向，这将触发反向入场。没有跟踪止损或其他交易管理技术被纳入。
- en: Results in general were much like those results I discussed 3 years ago. I did
    break it down a number of different ways, though. One interesting set of results
    came from looking at triangle breakdowns in the SPX when it was in a long-term
    uptrend. Those results can be seen below.

  zh: 总的来说，结果与我三年前讨论的结果非常相似。不过，我确实从多种不同的角度进行了分解。一组有趣的结果来自于研究当SPX处于长期上升趋势时三角形的突破。这些结果可以
    below看到。
- en: Entries and exits are as I described above. So in this case the results show
    the performance of shorting a breakdown. As you can see there has been an strong
    tendency for this trade to reverse back up and be stopped out before reaching
    its downside target.

  zh: 入场和退出如我上述描述。所以在这个案例中，结果显示了做空突破的表现。正如你所看到的，这种交易有强烈的倾向逆转回上涨，并在达到下侧目标之前被止损出局。
