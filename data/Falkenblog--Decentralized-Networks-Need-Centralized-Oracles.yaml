  zh: 去中心化预言机的另一个问题是它们通常为多样化的游戏提供服务。虽然这有助于产生类似亚马逊般的普遍性的错觉，但这使得特定的合同与预言机的激励机制不相符。在各种应用中，支付的频率和金额都会有所不同，因此一直激励诚实的预言机费用对大多数应用来说都太昂贵了。高效的解决方案将最小化上下文参数，这意味着最佳的一般解决方案对于任何特定的使用都将是次优的。
- en: While there are obvious costs to decentralization within an oracle, there are
    no benefits if the fundamental censorship/attack resistance requirement is satisfied.
    The wisdom of the crowd is not relevant for contracts on liquid assets like bitcoin
    or the S&P500\. A reputation scoring algorithm is pointless because the most obvious
    risk is an exit scam, which relies on behaving honestly until the final swindle
    (Bitconnect).

  zh: 尽管在Oracle中实现去中心化存在明显的成本，但如果满足基本的审查/攻击抵抗要求，则没有好处。群体智慧对于比特币或标普500等流动性资产的合约并不相关。声誉评分算法是无意义的，因为最明显的风险是退出诈骗，它依赖于诚实行事直到最后一次欺骗（Bitconnect）。
- en: To align the oracle's payoff space in a cryptoeconomically optimal way, one
    needs to create an oracle payoff such that the benefit of truthful reporting always
    outweighs the costs of misreporting. By having the oracle in total control, its
    revenue from truthful reporting is maximized; by being unambiguously responsible
    and easy to audit and punish, its costs from misreporting are fully born by the
    oracle; by playing a specific repeated game, the cost/benefit calculus is consistent
    each week; by giving a cheated user the ability and incentive to punish a cheating
    oracle, the cheat payoff minimized. These all lead to the efficiency of a single-agent
    oracle.

  zh: 为了以密码经济学的最优方式调整Oracle的收益空间，需要创建一个Oracle收益，以使真实报告的好处始终大于错误报告的成本。通过完全控制Oracle，其来自真实报告的收入得到了最大化；通过明确负责和易于审计和惩罚，其来自错误报告的成本完全由Oracle承担；通过玩一个特定的重复游戏，每周的成本/收益计算都是一致的；通过给予被欺骗的用户惩罚作弊的Oracle的能力和动机，作弊收益最小化。这些都导致单一代理Oracle的效率。

- en: Unintentional errors can come from corrupted sources or the algorithm that aggregates
    these prices and posts a single price to the contract. We often make unintentional
    mistakes and rely on the goodwill and common sense of those we do business with
    to 'undo' those cases where we might have added an extra zero to a payment. Credit
    cards allow chargebacks, and if a bank accidentally deposits $1MM in your account,
    you are liable to pay it back. The downside is that this process involves third
    parties who enforce the rule that big unintentional mistakes are reversible, and
    this implies they have rights over user account balances.

  zh: 不经意的错误可能来自损坏的来源或汇总这些价格并向合约发布单一价格的算法。我们经常犯不经意的错误，并依赖于我们与之交易的人的善意和常识来“纠正”我们可能在支付中多加了一个零的情况。信用卡允许退款，如果银行意外向您的帐户存入100万美元，您有责任将其归还。不利之处在于此过程涉及执行规则的第三方，即大额不经意的错误是可逆转的，这意味着它们对用户账户余额有权利。
- en: In OracleSwap, the oracle contract itself has two error checks within the solidity
    code. First, if prices move by more than 50% from their prior value, and secondly,
    if they are exactly the same as their previous value. These constraints catch
    the most common errors. Off the blockchain, however, is where error filtering
    is more efficiently addressed in general, and ultimately it should be made into
    an algorithm because otherwise, one introduces an attack surface via the human
    who would verify a final report. Thus, using many people to reduce errors just
    adds back in the more subtle and dangerous source of bad prices. OracleSwap uses
    an automated pull of prices from several independent sources, over a couple-minute
    window, and takes the median. As the contract is targeting long-term investors,
    a median price from several exchanges will have a tolerable standard error; as
    the precise feeds and exchanges are unspecified, this prevents censorship; as
    prices a posted during a 1-hour window that precludes trading, it is easy to collect
    and validate an accurate price.

  zh: 在OracleSwap中，Oracle合约本身在Solidity代码中有两个错误检查。首先，如果价格与其先前价值相比变动超过50％，其次，如果它们与其先前价值完全相同。这些约束条件捕捉到了最常见的错误。然而，在区块链之外，通常更有效地处理错误过滤，并且最终应该将其制作成算法，因为否则，通过验证最终报告的人会引入攻击面。因此，使用许多人来减少错误只是在增加更微妙和更危险的错误价格来源。OracleSwap使用了从几个独立来源自动提取价格，在几分钟的时间窗口内获取价格的中位数。由于合约针对长期投资者，来自几个交易所的中位数价格将具有可容忍的标准误差；由于未指定精确的源和交易所，这可以防止审查；由于价格在预防交易的1小时窗口期间发布，因此可以轻松收集和验证准确的价格。

    and pseudonymity to avoid censorship. Given that, the best way to create proper
    oracle incentives is to create a game where the payoffs for honesty and cheating

  zh: 去中心化的预言机解决了一个它们并不存在的问题：攻击和审查抵抗。更新预言机合约的代理只需访问互联网并具有假名以避免审查。鉴于此，创建适当的预言机激励的最佳方法是创建一个游戏，其中诚实和作弊的回报被良好参数化，并且外部人员可以轻松验证代理是否表现诚实。简单性对于任何健壮的游戏都至关重要，这意味着要删除参与方和程序。
- en: Markets are the ultimate decentralized mechanism. It is not a paradox that markets
    consist of centralized agents as it is often the nature of things that properties
    exist at lower levels but not higher ones. A decentralized market just needs consumers
    to have both choice and information, and for businesses to have free entry. Markets
    have always depended upon individuals and corporations with valuable reputations
    because invariably quality is difficult to assess, so consumers prefer sellers
    with good reputations to avoid going home with bad eggs or a car with bad wiring.
    Blockchains are the best accountability device in history, allowing contracts
    to create valuable reputations for their administrators while remaining anonymous
    and thus uncensorable.

  zh: 市场是最终的去中心化机制。市场由中央化的代理组成并不矛盾，因为通常情况下，属性存在于较低层次而不是较高层次是很自然的事情。一个去中心化的市场只需要消费者拥有选择和信息，并且企业有自由进入的条件。市场一直依赖于具有有价值声誉的个人和公司，因为往往质量很难评估，所以消费者更喜欢有良好声誉的卖家，以避免带着不好的鸡蛋或带着有问题电路的汽车回家。区块链是历史上最好的问责机制，允许合约为其管理员创建有价值的声誉，同时保持匿名，因此无法被审查。
