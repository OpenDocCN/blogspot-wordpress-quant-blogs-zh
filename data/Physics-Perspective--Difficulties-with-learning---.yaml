- en: (many thanks to ivansml for pointing this out to me) and its applications and
    limitations by Martin Shubik. It's a little old -- it appeared in the journal
    Complexity in 1998 -- but offers a very broad perspective which I think still
    holds today. Game theory in the pure sense generally views agents as coming to
    their strategies through rational calculation; this perspective has had huge influence
    in economics, especially in the context of relatively simple games with few players
    and not too many possible strategies. This part of game theory is well developed,
    although Shubik suggests there are probably many surprises left to learn.

  zh: （非常感谢ivansml指出这一点给我）以及马丁·舒比克对它的应用和限制。这有点旧——它出现在1998年的《复杂性》杂志上——但提供了一个非常广泛的视角，我认为今天仍然适用。纯游戏理论通常认为参与者通过理性计算来制定他们的策略；这种观点在经济学中产生了巨大的影响，特别是在相对简单的游戏中，玩家不多，可能的策略也不多。这部分游戏理论已经很好地发展了，尽管舒比克建议可能还有很多惊喜需要学习。
- en: Where the article really comes alive, however, is in considering the limitations
    to this strictly rational approach in games of greater complexity. In physics,
    the problem of two rigid bodies in gravitational interaction can be solved exactly
    (ignoring radiation, of course), but you get generic chaos as soon as you have
    three bodies or more. The same is true, Shubik argues, in game theory. Extend
    the number of players above three and as the number of possible permutations of
    strategies proliferates it is no longer plausible to assume that agents act rationally.
    The decision problems become too complex. One might still try to search for optimal
    N player solutions as a guide to what might be possible, but the rational agent
    approach isn't likely to be profitable as a guide to the likely behaviour and
    dynamics in such complex games. I highly recommend Shubik's short article to anyone
    interested in game theory, and especially its application to real world problems
    where people (or other agents) really can't hope to act on the basis of rational
    calculation, but instead have to use heuristics, follow hunches, and learn adaptively
    as they go.

  zh: 然而，文章在考虑这种严格的理性方法在更复杂游戏中的局限性时才真正生动起来。在物理学中，两个刚体在引力相互作用中的问题可以精确解决（当然忽略辐射），但当你有三个或更多的刚体时，就会产生普遍的混沌。舒比克认为，同样的情况也适用于游戏理论。将玩家数量增加到三人以上，随着策略可能性的排列组合越来越多，再假设参与者理性行动就不再合理了。决策问题变得过于复杂。人们可能仍然试图寻找最优N玩家解决方案作为可能性的指导，但理性代理方法很可能不是指导复杂游戏中可能行为和动态的有利工具。我强烈推荐舒比克的这篇文章给任何对游戏理论感兴趣的人，特别是它应用于现实世界问题的情况，在这些情况下，人们（或其他代理）真的不能希望基于理性计算行动，而必须使用启发式方法、跟随直觉，并随着行动不断适应学习。

    gets large. Choose the structure of the games at random and the most likely outcome
    is a rich ongoing evolution of strategic behaviour which never settles down into
    any equilibrium. But these games do seem to show characteristic dynamical behaviour
    such as "punctuated equilibrium" -- long periods of relative quiescence which
    get broken apart sporadically by episodes of tumultuous change -- and clustered
    volatility -- the natural clustering together of periods of high variability.
    These qualitative aspects appear to be generic features of the non-equilibrium
    dynamics of complex games. Interesting that they show up generically in markets
    as well.

    and adapt rather than "solving" the problem in any sense. Our learning itself
    may also never settle down into any stable form, but continually change as we
