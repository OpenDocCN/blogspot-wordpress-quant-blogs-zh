    how he initially vaulted into the wealth stratosphere. The standard story is that
    he made a fortune on the price discrepancies between bitcoin in Asia vs. the US
    exchanges in 2017\. Even SBF critic CoffeeZilla [accepts this narrative](https://youtu.be/TjTEVNcuV80?t=211),

    a charity headed by William MacAskill that focused on rationality and optimization

    childhood friend of SBF and worked for Google as a software engineer on the site’s
    front end for booking airline flights. SBF was given an introduction by MacAskill
    to Jane Street in college, and afterward, there for a couple of years, where he
    traded a variety of ETFs, futures, currencies, and equities. While this often
    is used to portray SBF as a precocious trader, there is no evidence. Someone with
    two years of experience, even if working for Goldman or Citadel, is still very
    ignorant and has little discretion in their job. Not only the Alameda founders

    was familiar with crypto. In 2017 bitcoin was booming, and as an asset with unprecedented
    global reach, the new exchanges worldwide were not well connected. Thus in May

    the delay in drafting contracts because you can be confident that the recipient
    of your money will not just disappear. Similarly, the EA community was small enough,
    and a shared vision of the ultimate good is a great foundation for trust. They
    could then get people into Korea or Japan to execute an arbitrage unavailable

    Non-psychopathic people think no one would be so bold as to do what they campaign
    against. However, it happens all the time. For example, the government-led disinformation
    campaign on social media was done under the pretext of fighting disinformation.
    Their tendentious definitions of truth, or ‘higher truths,’ revealed them as the
    primary disseminators of disinformation.

  zh: 在被指控之前就指责别人做错事是一种无害的方法。非心理病态的人认为没有人会如此大胆地做他们所反对的事情。然而，这种情况经常发生。例如，政府在社交媒体上进行的虚假信息宣传是以打击虚假信息为借口进行的。他们对真相或者“更高的真相”的武断定义，揭示了他们是虚假信息的主要传播者。
- en: It’s an SBF staple to inadvertently reveal his scammy tactics with the overconfidence
    typical of narcissistic fraudsters. In his April 2022 Bloomberg interview, he
    explained yield farming in a way that, as Matt Levine noted, was a classic Ponzi
    scheme. SBF responded, ‘that’s one framing of this,’ as if it was not a Ponzi
    if it had not collapsed. CoffeeZilla made a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6nAxiym9oc)
    on that bizarre interview that, in retrospect, is quite humorous. I suspect this
    same Ponzi mindset was behind the initial VCs and CZ’s interest in 2019\. While
    I am long-run bullish on crypto given government fiat incentives, one has to admit
    the current crypto community is a hive of scum and villainy on par with Mos Eisley.

- en: EA community was instrumental in creating the SBF train wreck. Not only did
    it supply all of the initial personnel and capital, but their wealthy and well-connected
    leaders would also give investors much reassurance. Further, the EA vision, applied
    to entrepreneurship, creates a classic misalignment of incentives. It centers
    on a profound flaw in their ‘earn to give’ and ‘80000 hours’ initiatives, promoted
    most conspicuously by MacAskill and Sam Harris, who were both big SBF supporters
    all the way through November 2022 (I think they are both innocent, but this naivete
    should disqualify them from administering a large charity ).

  zh: EA社区在制造SBF火车失事中功不可没。它不仅提供了所有最初的人员和资金，而且他们富有的和有权有势的领导人也给投资者带来了很多的保证。此外，EA愿景，应用于创业，造成了典型的激励不一致。它的核心在于他们“挣钱捐赠”和“80000小时”合作计划上存在一个严重的缺陷，最引人注目的是由MacAskill和Sam
    Harris等人所推动，他们一直支持SBF直到2022年11月（我认为他们都是无辜的，但这种天真应该使他们不能管理一个大的慈善机构）。
- en: Earning to give involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning job or investment
    strategy as an instrumental goal to maximize their ultimate goal, ‘total welfare,’
    the present value of the utility of billions of people over the infinite future.
    The EA conceit is that you can be a superstar, lawyer, entrepreneur, or investor
    while seeing it purely in instrumental terms. Anything not directly helping others,
    like giving food to the starving, or preventing existential risks like an AI apocalypse,
    is irrelevant in itself. It’s fine to be a well-paid rodeo cowboy or disc jockey,
    but only as a means to a much more ennobling end. The emphasis makes it highly
    unlikely one will excel at lawyering, investing, etc.

  zh: 赚钱给予的方法是有意追求高收入工作或投资策略作为最大化其最终目标“总体福祉”的工具性目标。EA的傲慢在于，即使你是一位超级明星、律师、企业家或投资者，也纯粹以工具性视角看待它。任何不直接帮助他人的事情，比如给饥饿的人提供食物，或者防止像AI启示录这样的灭绝性危险，都在本质上是无关紧要的。成为一位薪金丰厚的牛仔或音乐节目主持人是可以接受的，但只是作为一个更加高尚目的的手段。这种强调使得人极不可能在法律、投资等领域做出出色的表现。
- en: Almost everyone knows that their ultimate objective is not their day job. The
    difference is that the status or importance of most jobs is virtually indefensible
    within the EA worldview. In a traditional family, the loving wife of a great attorney
    loves not only that her husband’s income supports their family, but she feels
    pride in his excellence at his craft. The husband can then focus on his job, knowing
    that it not only supports his family but generates appreciation from those he
    loves most, as well as clients and colleagues. This helps him to focus and apply
    himself, making him an excellent attorney.

- en: In a modern economy, the division of labor makes it virtually impossible to
    see how our jobs move the needle. It takes faith in the market, where the division
    of labor prices services at their marginal value, to believe that if you are well-paid
    for doing something, it adds to world utility, even if it is not as transparent
    as handing food to a starving child, or getting a million likes for a TED talk
    on saving the planet. Though this does not work perfectly, it works naturally,
    undirected, better than any centralized plan.

- en: It is not rational to expect to make outsized returns on an avocation. In a
    competitive economy, builders of great companies not only have a vision but pay
    attention to details, the way that John D. Rockefeller implemented efficiencies
    in oil refining using meticulous cost-benefit analysis and understanding scale
    efficiencies. Rockefeller was a devout Christian and preferred fellow teetotaling
    Baptists like himself as partners, so he did not ignore his ultimate objective
    at work. However, he had confidence that doing one’s job well, whatever it was,
    was a great way to serve God. Most people not focused on abstract conceptions
    of world utility have no pangs of guilt doing something they find profitable and
    interesting. That allows them to focus and become great at it.
