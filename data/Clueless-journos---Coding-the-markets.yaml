    really need pointing out. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together will figure
    it out like this: read a newspaper article on your specialist subject, notice
    that the author has failed to do even the most basic research and ask the most
    obvious questions, then realise that the same must apply to pretty much everything
    else in the paper.'

  zh: 大多数记者的愚昧是我关注的一个小小主题。其实这个问题基本不需要指出来。只要你的脑子里有两个脑细胞，就会意识到这一点：阅读有关你的专业领域的报纸文章时，注意到作者甚至都没做最基本的研究并问出最显而易见的问题，然后意识到报纸中几乎所有其他内容也都是如此。
- en: Today's Evening Standard had yet another example. The City Editor, [Anthony
    Hilton](http://www.gordonpoole.com/speakers/AnthonyHilton.htm) commented on 'Big
    banks deadly game'. He mentions Enron, points out that they had a dealing room,
    and then asserts that we're now surrounded by Enrons, in the shape of the global
    investment banks, which of course, all have dealing rooms. He goes on to say "the
    big banks make between half and three quarters of their profit from dealing, and
    that no one from the outside can tell how they do it, or what their business really
    is".

  zh: 今天的《伦敦晚报》又有一个例子。《城市编辑》[安东尼·希尔顿](http://www.gordonpoole.com/speakers/AnthonyHilton.htm)谈到了“大银行的致命游戏”。他提到恩隆（Enron），指出他们有一个交易部，然后断言我们现在被全球投资银行所包围，这些银行当然都有交易部。他接着说，“大银行的一半到四分之三的利润来自交易，并且外部人无法判断他们是怎么做到的，或者他们的真正业务是什么”。
- en: Later in the column there's an attempt to appear cluefull by means of a reference
    to [Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/). So let's spell it out for Hilton,
    since he seems not to understand what a dealer is, depsite his long and distinguished
    journalisic career. A dealer offers liquidity to the market by quoting prices
    to buy and sell a range of financial instruments in trades up to a certain size.
    I work for a dealer that supplies liquidity to the European government bond markets,
    among others. By standing ready to buy or sell EuroGovies in large amounts, my
    employer makes it possible for pension funds and insurers to take or unwind positions
    in EuroGovies at any time. They also make it possible for European governments
    to conduct treasury operations smoothly – for instance borrowing to finance government
    spending by issuing new debt. Dealers play a critical role in the smooth running
    of market economies.

  zh: 后来在专栏中，有人试图显示出些许了解，通过引用[Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/)来证明。因此，让我们为希尔顿指出一下，因为他似乎不理解交易员是什么，尽管他有着悠久而显赫的新闻界职业生涯。交易员通过报价买卖一系列金融工具，以交易量达到某个规模，来为市场提供流动性。我为一家为欧洲政府债券市场等市场提供流动性的交易员工作。通过随时准备买入或卖出大量欧洲政府债券，我所在的公司使得养老基金和保险公司可以随时持有或减少欧洲政府债券的头寸。他们还可能帮助欧洲政府平稳地进行国库操作——例如通过发行新债券筹措政府支出的资金。交易员在市场经济的稳定运行中扮演着关键的角色。
- en: I suspect Hilton is confused about the distinction between dealers and proprietary
    traders. No doubt he's confused about a lot else too.

  zh: 我怀疑希尔顿对交易员和自营交易员之间的区别感到困惑。毫无疑问，他对很多其他事情也感到困惑。
