    drew on their charts, it did not signal a break for either of the triangle testing
    methods I laid out last week. For violations to be official I currently would
    need to see one of the following: 1316.75 broken on the downside for method #1,
    1369.23 on the upside for method #1, or 1367.94 to the upside or 1327.04 to the
    downside for method #2\. Therefore, as per the studies, we are still waiting for
    a break to look to fade. The studies on Thursday night suggested fading the breakout
    could be the highest-odds play.'

  zh: 虽然周五早间的下跌可能违反了某些技术分析师在他们的图表上绘制的趋势线，但它并没有触发我上周提出的三角形测试方法中的任何一个方向的突破。要使违反成为正式的，我现在需要看到以下之一：方法#1的1316.75下方被突破，方法#1的1369.23上方被突破，或者方法#2的上方1367.94或下方1327.04被突破。因此，根据研究，我们仍在等待一个突破来观察趋势。周四晚上的研究表明，对突破进行回调可能是胜率最高的选择。
- en: While it failed to move the S&P 500 out of its range, the action Friday certainly
    wasn’t mundane. A late-day reversal led to a sizable upside surge – moving the
    indices from squarely negative to squarely positive. I decided to look and see
    whether past late-day surges had led to a directional edge over the days following.
    Looking back 30 years I was only able to find 22 other times where the S&P 500
    gained over 1.5% in the last hour of trading. Results following those instances
    were mixed. Over the next one and two days the market closed higher 10 of 22 times.
    Over 3 and 5 day periods the market increased 14 times. Looking our further (10,
    15, 20 days) results were close to a coin flip. The win/loss ratio in all these
    instances was close to 1 as well.

  zh: 虽然它没有将标普500带出其波动范围，但周五的行动绝对不是平淡无奇的。尾盘的逆转导致大幅上涨——将指数从坚定的负面转变为坚定的正面。我决定看看过去尾盘的上涨是否在随后的日子里带来了方向性的优势。回顾30年，我只能找到22次标普500在交易最后一小时上涨超过1.5%的情况。这些情况后的结果是混合的。在接下来的1天和2天里，市场有10次收盘较高。在3天和5天周期内，市场有14次上涨。再往远看（10天、15天、20天），结果接近于抛硬币。在这些所有情况中的胜/负比率也接近于1。
- en: In other words – the late day surge on Friday seems to have no predictive value
    when looking out over the next few days. All it managed to do was put the market
    squarely back in the middle of its range. Traders with time-frames longer than
    intraday may want to continue to wait for a range resolution before getting aggressive.

  zh: 换句话说——周五晚些时候的上涨似乎在展望未来几天时没有预测价值。它所做的只是将市场准确地回到了其波动范围内。那些持仓时间超过日内交易时间的交易员可能想要在积极介入之前继续等待波动范围的解决。
