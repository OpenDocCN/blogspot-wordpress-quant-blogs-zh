- en: I have a tendency to look at the world through ETFs and when thinking globally,
    often in terms of country ETFs. I find that regional ETFs too often dilute some
    of the trends and ideas I am looking to capture. Further compounding the problem
    is that I have a tendency to think in terms of [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    and developed markets more than, say, broad geographic boundaries such as Europe
    and Asia.

  zh: 我倾向于通过ETF来看待世界，当进行全球思考时，通常会以国家ETF为单位。我发现区域ETF往往会淡化我所追求的趋势和想法。问题进一步复杂化的是，我倾向于以[新兴市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)和发达市场为单位进行思考，而不是说，广泛的地理边界，如欧洲和亚洲。
- en: Even with this bias, I was surprised to see in this week's [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    that if one looks at the performance of emerging and developed markets ETFs for
    both Europe and Asia over the course of the past year, the strong correlation
    is not between the geographies, but across the emerging/developed distinction.
    In spite of all the sovereign debt problems in Europe, emerging Europe ([GUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GUR))
    has generally been the top performer of the group, but this performance has been
    closely matched by emerging Asia ([GMF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GMF)).
    Not surprisingly, developed markets in Europe ([IEV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEV))
    have been more volatile and slight underperformers when compared to their developed
    market counterparts in Asia ([VPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VPL)),
    but the margin has been a relatively slim one.

  zh: 即使有这种偏见，我也很惊讶地看到在本周的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)中，如果查看过去一年中欧洲和亚洲新兴市场和发达市场ETF的表现，强烈的相关性并不是地理之间的，而是跨越新兴/发达的区别。尽管欧洲有所有的主权债务问题，新兴欧洲（[GUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GUR)）通常一直是表现最好的，但这种表现已经被新兴亚洲（[GMF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GMF)）紧密匹配。毫不奇怪，欧洲的发达市场（[IEV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEV)）一直更加波动，并且略低于其亚洲发达国家市场同行（[VPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VPL)），但差距相对较小。
- en: For me at least, the key takeaway is that emerging Asia looks a lot more like
    emerging Europe than developed Asia. Perhaps it is time to start rethinking our
    investing geography…

  zh: 至少对我来说，关键的启示是，新兴亚洲看起来更像新兴欧洲，而不是发达亚洲。也许是我们开始重新思考投资地理的时候了…
