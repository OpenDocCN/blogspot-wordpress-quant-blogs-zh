- en: One of the most-loved charts I assemble each year is my retrospective look at
    the year in volatility. I already touched on some of the highlights of [event
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility) in
    text form in [Expectations, Surprises and Fear in 2011](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/expectations-surprises-and-fear-in-2011.html),
    but this is one case in which I believe a picture does a better job of telling
    the story in the context of a timeline for the entire year.

  zh: 我每年最喜欢整理的图表之一就是回顾全年的波动性。我在[2011年的预期、惊喜和恐惧](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/expectations-surprises-and-fear-in-2011.html)一文中已经以文字形式提到了一些[事件波动](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility)的高潮，但在这个案例中，我认为一幅图在整年时间的线轴上能更好地讲述故事。
- en: From a volatility perspective, the first half of [2011](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2011)
    was relatively benign, even though the global social and economic fabric was ripped
    by [Arab Spring](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Arab%20Spring) and
    the Japanese trio of disasters which came in the form of the earthquake, tsunami
    and nuclear meltdown.

  zh: 从波动性的角度看，2011年上半年相对平静，尽管全球社会经济结构因[阿拉伯之春](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Arab%20Spring)和日本地震、海啸和核泄漏灾难而受到严重冲击。
- en: Things were much more promising during the middle of the year when the Greek
    parliament voted in favor of austerity and the euro zone agreed to expand the
    European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to €780 million.

- en: For a while, there was considerable angst surrounding the bipartisan politics
    associated with the U.S. debt ceiling deadline at the beginning of August, but
    only after the Democrats and Republicans failed to come up with a meaningful debt
    reduction deal did investor anxiety shift back to Europe. Ironically, the downgrade
    of the U.S. debt from AAA to AA+ had very little impact on Treasury securities,
    which actually began to rally sharply after the downgrade. When Europe returned
    to the center stage, however, the [sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)
    was escalating rapidly and it was now [Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)
    that was in the crosshairs. The VIX shot up to 48 on August 8^(th) and was regularly
    above 30 through the end of November, setting a new record for persistent [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)
    in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    in the process.

  zh: 在八月初美国债务上限截止日期附近的党派政治问题上，市场曾一度感到相当焦虑，但直到民主党和共和党未能达成有意义的减债协议后，投资者的焦虑才又转回欧洲。讽刺的是，美国债务从AAA降级到AA+对国债证券的实际影响非常小，实际上在降级之后，国债证券开始急剧反弹。然而，当欧洲再次成为焦点时，[主权债务危机](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)正在迅速升级，这次轮到[意大利](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)成为众矢之的。8月8日，VIX指数飙升到48，并在11月底之前一直保持在30以上，创下了[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)持续[反向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)的新记录。
- en: The VIX was a high wire act throughout August and September, with multiple excursions
    into the 40s. Even after the S&P 500 index bottomed on October 4 at 1074, the
    VIX remained stubbornly elevated in October and November, before finally falling
    into the 20s in December. While the SPX was essentially unchanged for the year,
    the VIX ended 2011 at 23.40, up 31.8% over 2010’s close of 17.75\. At the same
    time, the VIX futures are calling for a VIX of between 29 and 30 by the mid-point
    of 2012, suggesting that volatility will climb higher once again in the coming
    months.

  zh: 在8月和9月，VIX表现得像高空走钢丝，多次触及40s。即使在10月4日标普500指数触底至1074点之后，VIX在10月和11月仍然固执地维持在高位，最终在12月跌至20s。虽然标普500指数全年基本持平，但VIX在2011年结束时收于23.40，比2010年收盘价17.75上涨了31.8%。与此同时，VIX期货预计到2012年中旬VIX将在29至30之间，这表明在未来几个月中，波动性将再次上升。
- en: In a year where most asset classes struggled mightily, volatility was one of
    the few great long positions. With a higher starting point going into 2012, it
    will be difficult for the VIX to repeat its market-beating performance once again,
    but if the euro zone and some of the geopolitical flash points fail to make progress,
    2012 may indeed be the year of the VIX.

  zh: 在大多数资产类别苦苦挣扎的一年里，波动性是少数几个伟大的长期投资之一。随着2012年起点更高，VIX要想再次重复其超越市场的表现将非常困难，但如果欧元区和一些地缘政治热点无法取得进展，2012年或许真的会成为VIX的年份。
