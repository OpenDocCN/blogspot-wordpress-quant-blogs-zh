- en: the most detailed paper Geanakoplos has published (as far as I know) describing
    the leverage cycle -- the natural feedback process that repeatedly drives economies
    through cycles in which leverage rises, driving increasing asset prices, and then
    falls as investors become uncertain, more cautious, and demand more collateral,
    Prices then crash down accordingly. His argument is that leverage (determined
    by collateral rates) is a key macroeconomic variable completely independent from
    interest rates, and often just as important to the economy at large. In particular,
    increasing (decreasing) leverage is one key direct cause of increasing (or decreasing)
    prices. As evidence, look at the figure below for housing prices from 2000 through
    2009\. It shows how the average down payment required for sub-prime mortgages
    went up and then down, in both cases just in advance of housing prices. (Okay,

  zh: Geanakoplos最详细的论文（据我所知），描述了杠杆周期——一种自然反馈过程，反复推动经济周期，其中杠杆上升，推动资产价格上涨，然后下降，投资者变得不确定，更加谨慎，并要求更多的抵押品，价格随即相应暴跌。他的论点是，杠杆（由抵押品率决定）是一个完全独立于利率的关键宏观经济变量，通常对整个经济同样重要。特别是，杠杆的增加（减少）是导致价格上涨（或下跌）的一个关键直接原因。作为证据，请查看下面的图表，了解2000年至2009年间的房价。它显示了次级抵押贷款平均首付要求如何上升然后下降，两种情况都是在房价上涨之前。

  zh: 从实际角度来看，我认为他的论点中有两件事让我印象深刻：
- en: First, given the clear importance of leverage in driving economic outcomes,
    it is quite remarkable that the Federal Reserve Bank has not in the past made
    any systematic effort to collect the kind of data it would need to monitor average
    collateral rates in the economy. Between 2000 and 2005, for example, no one at
    the Fed was going to banks and collecting information on how much collateral they
    were demanding when lending. This was just not considered a crucial macroeconomic
    variable. Judging from the tone in his talk, Geanakoplos finds this pretty amazing
    too. He mentions that the Fed contacted him in 2008 or so to get hold of data
    of this kind that he had collected. It seems that the Fed has now accepted the
    systemic importance of leverage and is seriously considering including leverage
    as a key variable in future macroeconomic monitoring. Whether banks and hedge
    funds will be required to report leverage levels, I don't know, but this idea
    is at least on the table. Good thing, I think.

  zh: 首先，鉴于杠杆在驱动经济结果中的重要性的清晰性，美联储银行在过去没有做出任何系统性努力来收集它需要的数据，以监测经济中的平均抵押品率，这是非常令人瞩目的。例如，在2000年和2005年之间，美联储的任何人都没有去银行收集他们在放贷时要求多少抵押品的信息。这被认为是关键的宏观经济变量。从他的讲话语气判断，Geanakoplos也认为这非常令人惊讶。他提到美联储在2008年或2009年左右联系他获取这类数据。看起来美联储现在接受了杠杆的系统重要性，并认真考虑将杠杆作为未来宏观经济监测的关键变量。是否需要银行和对冲基金报告杠杆水平，我不知道，但这个想法至少摆在桌面上。我认为这是一个好事。
- en: A second interesting point is one that seems kind of obvious in retrospect.
    The leverage that drives the rise of prices in Geanakoplos's picture is leverage
    in long positions, which enables optimistic investors to buy more than they would
    otherwise be able to buy. Leverage in the opposing sense, short leverage allowing
    pessimists to speculate on a collapse in the market, would act to depress prices.
    Hence, it is probably more than a little significant that credit default swaps
    (CDS) for mortgage backed securities were created in 2005\. These most likely
    acted as a key trigger of the beginning of the crash. As Geanakoplos writes,

  zh: 第二个有趣的问题是，回想起来似乎有点显而易见。在Geanakoplos的图片中推动价格上涨的杠杆是多头杠杆，这使得乐观的投资者能够购买比他们原本能够购买更多的东西。相反意义上的杠杆，允许悲观主义者对市场崩溃进行投机的空头杠杆，会起到推低价格的作用。因此，信用违约互换（CDS）于2005年创立的可能性，或许在危机的开始阶段起到了关键的触发作用。正如Geanakoplos所写，
- en: In my view, an important trigger for the collapse of 2007–9 was the introduction
    of CDS contracts into the mortgage market in late 2005, at the height of the market.
    Credit default swaps on corporate bonds had been traded for years, but until 2005
    there had been no standardized mortgage CDS contract. I do not know the impetus
    for this standardization; perhaps more people wanted to short the market once
    it got so high. But the implication was that afterward the pessimists, as well
    as the optimists, had an opportunity to leverage. This was bound to depress mortgage
    security prices. ... this, in turn, forced underwriters of mortgage securities
    to require mortgage loans with higher collateral so they would be more attractive,
    which, in turn, made it impossible for homeowners to refinance their mortgages,
    forcing many to default, which then began to depress home prices, which then made
    it even harder to sell new mortgages, and so on. I believe the introduction of
    CDS trading on a grand scale in mortgages is a critical, overlooked factor in
    the crisis. Until now people have assumed it all began when home prices started
    to fall in 2006\. But why home prices should begin to fall then has remained a
    mystery.

  zh: 在我看来，2007-2009年金融危机的一个重要触发因素是2005年底在房地产市场高峰期引入了CDS合约。公司债券的信用违约互换已经交易了好几年，但直到2005年之前，还没有标准化过的按揭CDS合约。我不知道推动这一标准化的动力是什么；也许当市场达到如此高度时，更多的人想要做空市场。但后果是，此后悲观主义者以及乐观主义者都有了杠杆的机会。这肯定会导致按揭证券价格下跌。...这又迫使按揭证券的承销商要求更高的抵押物，以使按揭贷款更具吸引力，而这又使得房主无法重新融资按揭，迫使许多房主违约，这又开始推低房价，这又使得新房贷更难销售，如此循环。我相信，在按揭产品上大规模引入CDS交易是危机中的一个关键、被忽视的因素。到目前为止，人们一直认为一切都始于2006年房价开始下跌。但房价为何那时开始下跌一直是个谜。
