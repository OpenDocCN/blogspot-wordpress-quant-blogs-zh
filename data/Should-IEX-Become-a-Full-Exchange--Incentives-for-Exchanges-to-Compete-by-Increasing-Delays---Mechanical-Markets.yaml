- en: The source familiar with the SEC’s thinking on the matter said PSX may have

    to do. But I get the sense from the above that those differences are not what’s

    is a good thing, but it’s important to question it in a sensible way. Allowing
    quotes to have a delay seems perfectly harmless, until you consider making them
    displayed, protected quotes. To see why, it’s useful to consider the analogy with
    liquidity-provider rebates.

  zh: 现在，IEX的模式和PSX试图做的之间有一些重要的区别。但从上面的内容来看，这些区别并不是改变SEC想法的原因。当然，质疑可能过时的监管是一件好事，但重要的是要以一种明智的方式进行质疑。允许报价有延迟看起来完全无害，直到你考虑到要使其成为展示受保护报价。为了了解原因，考虑与流动性提供者回扣的类比是有用的。
- en: Liquidity-provider rebates are controversial for a variety of reasons. One of
    those reasons is that, in combination with the order protection rule, they can
    create a ‘race to the bottom’ where exchanges are compelled by competitive forces
    to have higher and higher rebates. Imagine a world where Exchange A has a $1.00
    per share rebate and commensurate access fee. Exchange B has no rebate and no
    access fee. Say the market values QCOM stock at $50 and an investor is trying
    to sell 100 shares of it. Maybe there’s a bid on Exchange B for $50.00\. On Exchange
    A, however, the bids are about $50.99 – because the bidder will be paid an extra
    dollar upon execution. Under the order protection rule, Exchange B is nominally
    offering the best bid so the investor’s sell order *must* be routed to Exchange
    B – even if the investor’s effective sell price after fees will be $49.99, a penny
    worse than the price available on Exchange A. Thus, in order to maintain market
    share, exchanges would continually raise their rebates to be greater than those
    offered by competitors. It’s not hard to see how this would spiral out of control.
    The SEC placed a 0.3 cent cap on access fees partly for this reason and there
    has been [plenty](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/nasdaq-omx-congress-marketsrules-idUSL2N0Q31FH20140728)
    of [talk](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bats-to-sec-lets-end-maker-taker-system-of-market-fees-2015-01-06)

  zh: 流动性提供者回扣之所以具有争议性，原因多种多样。其中之一是，与订单保护规则相结合，它们可能会创造出一种“逐底竞争”的局面，在竞争力量的驱使下，交易所不得不不断提高回扣比例。想象一下这样一个世界，交易所A提供每股1.00美元的回扣和相应的接入费。交易所B既没有回扣也没有接入费。假设市场对QCOM股票的估值为50美元，一位投资者试图出售100股该股票。可能在交易所B上有50.00美元的买入价。然而，在交易所A上，出价大约为50.99美元——因为出价者在成交时会获得额外的一美元。根据订单保护规则，交易所B名义上提供最好的买入价，因此投资者的卖出订单*必须*被路由到交易所B——即使投资者在支付费用后的有效卖出价格将为49.99美元，比交易所A可用的价格低一分钱。因此，为了维持市场份额，交易所会不断上调回扣，使其高于竞争对手提供的回扣。很容易看出这种做法如何失控。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）对接入费设定0.3美分的上限部分原因就是这一点，而且已经有[大量](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/nasdaq-omx-congress-marketsrules-idUSL2N0Q31FH20140728)的[讨论](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bats-to-sec-lets-end-maker-taker-system-of-market-fees-2015-01-06)认为，即使这个水平也过高。
- en: I’d argue that adding an intentional delay into an exchange is the temporal
    version of the price distortion caused by high rebates. Consider what would happen
    if an Exchange implemented a 10 second delay. Any time the market moved, all incoming
    orders (on any exchange, marketable or otherwise) would have to be routed to the
    stale, inaccessible quotes displayed by the delayed exchange. [[4](#bottom)] If
    the traders on the delayed exchange who deleted those now-stale quotes changed
    their minds and quickly re-submitted orders, they might get executed against some
    of those incoming orders that were required to route to the delayed exchange.
    Much of the time, the routed-in orders would not get executed and would have to
    be repeatedly tried again. The result being mostly that investors would need to
    wait longer for orders to get executed at worse prices. But, as a side-effect
    of the routing, the delayed exchange would gain market share. [[5](#bottom)] Other
    exchanges, in response, would be spurred to institute their own delays, making
    the market completely non-functional.

  zh: 我会认为，在交易所中添加有意延迟是高回扣引起的价格扭曲的时间版本。考虑一下如果一个交易所实施10秒延迟会发生什么。每次市场有变动时，所有 incoming
    orders（在任何交易所，无论是否可成交）都必须路由到延迟交易所显示的过时、无法访问的报价。如果延迟交易所的交易员删除了这些现在过时的报价并改变了主意，迅速重新提交订单，他们可能会对一些必须路由到延迟交易所的
    incoming orders 执行交易。大部分时间，路由进的订单不会被执行，不得不反复尝试。结果主要是投资者需要等待更长时间，以更差的价位成交订单。但是，由于路由的副作用，延迟的交易所将获得市场份额。其他交易所为了应对，也会被激励实施自己的延迟，使得市场完全失去功能。
- en: Thinking of our analogy with access fees, disaster could be averted if a cap
    on the additional delay were established. What should that cap be? My intuition
    is that the cap should be, at most, 10% of the typical time it takes for orders
    to be routed. It’s no coincidence that this is right around the level of IEX’s
    delay. IEX states that the delay allows their system to update its view of the
    NBBO. [[6](#bottom2)] The NBBO (at its fastest) generally changes at about the
    routing timescale (which is complicated, but around 2ms [[7](#bottom2)]). And
    a large chunk of the routing timescale is due to exchanges deciding what to do
    with an order based on the prices they see on other exchanges. This process is
    similar to what IEX needs to do when updating their view of the NBBO, except IEX
    does not need to spend time assembling an order to send to another exchange.

  zh: 如果我们用访问费用这个类比来思考，如果对额外延迟设立上限，就可以避免灾难。那个上限应该是多少呢？我的直觉是，这个上限最多应该是订单被路由通常所需时间的10%。巧合的是，这个数字大致就是IEX的延迟水平。IEX表示，延迟允许他们的系统更新对NBBO的看法。[]([[6](#bottom2)])
    NBBO（在最快的情况下）通常在大约路由时间尺度（这很复杂，但大约是2ms []([[7](#bottom2)])）发生变化。路由时间尺度的很大一部分是由于交易所根据在其他交易所看到的价格决定如何处理订单。这个过程与IEX更新对NBBO的看法时需要做的事情相似，只是IEX不需要花时间组装一个订单发送到另一个交易所。
- en: I don’t want to get into the actual value of the delay. But I will say that
    an exchange with good technology should not have trouble updating their view of
    the market much, much faster than 350us. I have, on rare occasions, seen orders
    executing at the old NBBO after a single tick up or down. [[8](#bottom2)] This
    has always been on dark pools though; I’ve never seen it on a major exchange.
    Goldman’s Sigma-X was [fined](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-01/goldman-sachs-got-lost-in-its-own-dark-pool)
    for this very reason, so it’s not just an imaginary issue. IEX rightfully wants
    to ensure that this won’t happen to their customers. That said, Goldman updated
    their system and fixed the issue. I imagine IEX could do the same. [[9](#bottom2)]

    但这总是在暗池中发生的；我从未在主要交易所见过这种情况。高盛的Sigma-X因此事被罚款 []([[9](#bottom2)])。IEX合理地希望确保这种情况不会发生在他们的客户身上。话说回来，高盛更新了他们的系统并解决了这个问题。我想IEX也能做到。
