    when IEX showed a lot of activity on Valeant, the price seemed to either drift
    down or stay stable (sometimes appearing “pinned”) — and, when IEX showed a pause

    I have never used information like this to make trading decisions (nor has my

    on IEX was comparable to the volume Pershing Square [reported](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885590/000119312515418565/d106380dex997.htm)

    that means that their order flow probably attracted liquidity onto IEX. A lot
    of that may have been due to execution algos noticing the flow and choosing to
    interact with it. If execution algos can use information from dark pool fills

    Square认为这个项目所有的好处都归机构交易者所有。

    market cap as Nasdaq, $10B. 5 million shares is about 0.2% of IEX’s [monthly](http://www.iextrading.com/stats/)
    volume of 2-3B shares. Say that Pershing Square typically trades about once per
    month, so that they can increase IEX’s long-term revenue by 0.2%. Again, let’s
    be generous and say that 0.2% of revenue increases IEX’s chance of “success” by
    1%. So, Pershing Square’s loyalty could improve IEX’s expected value by as much

    know, but a conservative estimate should be at least 1%, right? Given the explosion
    in volume on IEX, what probability would the market assign to the possibility
    that Pershing was selling? My personal estimate at the time was over 50%, with
    a <10% chance that they were buying (neither I nor my company used this information
    to trade). So, perhaps the stock would (and did) drop by 0.5% because of this
    leak. If Pershing had $300M left to trade, this one incident would cost them $1.5M.

    Pershing 正在出售的可能性多大的概率？我当时个人的估计是超过50%，他们正在买入的可能性不到10%（我和我的公司没有使用这些信息进行交易）。所以，也许由于这个泄露，股票会（确实）下跌0.5%。如果Pershing还有3亿美元的交易资金，这个事件将使他们损失1500万美元。不难想象这个数字会更高几倍。
- en: Instead of Valeant, say that Pershing Square wants to trade a stock that nobody
    expects them to. Now, people looking at IEX’s reported volume wouldn’t have much
    idea of the side of the trade, or that it came from Pershing Square. But, the
    market-makers on IEX would probably know the side. The first hour after Pershing’s
    meta-order begins trading, maybe these HFTs develop an inkling (10% probability)
    that the meta-order is large (50% of ADV). Let’s assume, as IEX seems to, that
    HFTs are ruthless and that they start moving the price in accordance with the
    meta-order’s expected market impact. Using the square-root law (e.g. [p8](https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/quantitativefinance/Public/events/SLIDES%203RD%20IMPERIAL%20ETH/Jonathan%20Donier%20.pdf)),
    the 50% of ADV meta-order could be expected to move the price by sqrt(0.5) * the
    stock’s daily volatility. Say the daily volatility is 1%, so the market impact
    would be around 0.7%. It’s already been an hour though, so perhaps half of this
    market impact has already occurred. The HFTs have 10% confidence that this further
    0.35% move will happen, so they move the price by 0.03%. If Pershing had $300M
    left to trade at this point, that 0.03% would cost them about $100k. And maybe
    Pershing trades this size 5 times per year, so the routing preference could cost
    them $500k/yr. This is a paranoid (and rough) estimate of HFT order anticipation,
    but paranoia seems to be part of the IEX ethos.
