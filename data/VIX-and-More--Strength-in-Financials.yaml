    – and when it comes to front running any FOMC announcements, stupidity often rules
    the day.

  zh: 我认为勇气和愚蠢之间有一条细线——而当涉及到抢跑美联储的任何声明时，通常都是愚蠢占据了上风。
- en: With that in mind, consider the action in the financial sector over the past
    week or so.  Looking at the [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)
    SPDR, we have an impressive two day bottom put in last Tuesday and Wednesday,
    with a pop of 20% from a bottom of 24.11 and a potential cross of the 50 day SMA
    less than 1% away from current levels.  The volume at the bottom was impressive
    and has held up fairly well on the way up.  Certainly a cross of the 50 day SMA
    and a turning up of the 20 day counterpart must bode well for that sector and
    increase the likelihood that this month’s plunge will ultimately turn out to be
    the bottom.

  zh: 带着这样的想法，考虑一下过去一周左右金融行业的动作。看看[XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)
    SPDR的表现，在上周二和周三我们看到了一个令人印象深刻的两日底部形成，自24.11的低点反弹了20%，距离当前水平不到1%的地方有可能出现50日均线的穿越。底部时的成交量很大，并且上升过程中保持得相当不错。当然，50日均线的穿越和20日均线的拐头向上对这一行业是个好兆头，增加了本月的大跌最终可能触底的可能性。
- en: All of this is predicated, of course, on the markets having confidence that
    the Fed is doing the right things to shore up our financial systems, provide appropriate
    liquidity, and keep the dominoes from getting any wobblier.  Presumably, the markets
    have priced in a 50 basis point move by the Fed today and have valued the financial
    sector on the assumption that solutions to the current situation – though they
    may be slow to take root and turn out to be expensive – are going to ultimately
    resolve the current credit crisis.

  zh: 所有这些当然都基于市场对美联储增强金融系统、提供适当流动性和防止多米诺骨牌效应的信心。假设市场已经price in了美联储今天50个基点的动作，并且认为金融行业的解决方案——虽然它们可能生根发芽缓慢且代价昂贵——最终将解决当前的信贷危机。
- en: I won’t be front running the Fed today, but if the financial sector turnaround
    means anything – and it usually does – it could mean that there is still a lot
    of easy money to be made cherry picking some of the stronger names that have beaten
    down with the rest of the sector.

  zh: 我今天不会抢跑美联储，但如果金融行业的反转意味着什么——通常确实如此——那么这意味着通过挑选一些在行业内被打压的较强股票，仍然有很多容易赚的钱。
