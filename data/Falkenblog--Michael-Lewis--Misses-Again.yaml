- en: As luck is when preparation met opportunity, he was prepared to find this better
    than anyone, and the new CDX default swaps allowed Eisman to put this trade on
    directly right when the market started to really get bad, a trade he had been
    predisposed towards for 15 years. In other words, Eisman was correct, but his
    permabear view on subprime mortgage highlights that subprime's essence is not
    the problem, but rather, the climax of the bubble was the issue. Lewis notes that
    in the end, investor demand really created these 'liar loans', because there was
    so much demand that unethical suppliers who knew better filled the need. This
    is a much more complicated issue, because if in the end, buyers were not doing
    due diligence, wasn't their demand, the essence of the problem? Where did this
    demand come from? In the end, this story is like someone talking about a Robber
    Baron making a fortune in the panic of 1893--interesting, but not the essence
    of the Industrial Revolution though some would like you to think so (see Hielbroner's
    Worldly Philosophers extended portrayal of conspicuous consumption and such).

  zh: 幸运就是准备好遇到机会，他准备比任何人都好的找到了这个更好的机会，而新的CDX违约掉期让艾斯曼有机会在市场开始真的变得糟糕的时候直接进行这个交易，这个交易他已经倾向于15年。换句话说，艾斯曼是正确的，但他对次级抵押贷款的根本问题是错误的看法突显了次级抵押贷款的实质并不是问题，而是泡沫的高潮才是问题所在。路易斯指出，在最后，投资者的需求才真正创造了这些'说谎贷款'，因为有如此之多的需求，道德败坏的供应商为了填补需求而做出不负责任的行为。这是一个更加复杂的问题，因为如果最终，买家们没有进行尽职调查，难道不是他们的需求才是问题的根本吗？这种需求是从何而来的？最终，这个故事就像是有人在谈论一个抢劫大亨在1893年的恐慌中发了大财——有趣，但并不是工业革命的核心，虽然有些人希望你这样认为（见海尔布朗的《世界哲学家》对显眼消费的扩展描述）。

    context, because the powerful masses they lead do not want to be dominated, and

    the practical consensus. The ignorance at the end of a cycle is quite different,
    the orgasmic phase with impossible business models that with hindsight always
    seem so stupid. These are different problems, and the theme, that stupidity and
